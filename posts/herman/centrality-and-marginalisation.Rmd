### Welcome to the History of Late Analytic Philosophy {#sec:Intro}

It's a good time to be doing history of late analytic philosophy. There
is flurry of new and exciting work on how philosophy got from the death
pangs of positivism and ordinary language philosophy to where it is
today. Some may see this as a much needed gap in the literature. Indeed,
there are a couple of reasons for scepticism about there being such a
field as history of late analytic philosophy, both of which are
plausible but wrong.

<aside>
*Philosophical Studies* 171: 517-533. Thanks to Herman Cappelen and Ishani Maitra for many discussions about the material in this paper.
</aside>

One reason is that it is too recent. But it can't be too recent for
general historical study; there are courses in history departments on
September 11, so it's not like looking at philosophy from thirty to
forty years ago is rushing in where historians fear to tread. And
indeed, if logical positivism could be treated historically in the
1960s, and ordinary language philosophy could be treated historically at
the turn of the century, it seems a reasonable time to look back at the
important works of the 1970s that established the contemporary era in
philosophy.

Another reason is that we all know it so well. We are still so engaged
with the key works by Kripke, Lewis, Burge, Perry, Thomson and so on
that we don't need to also look at them the way we look at Descartes,
Locke and Hume. But this, it turns out, is not true. Books by Daniel
@Nolan2005 and Wolfgang @Schwarz2009 changed the way that some
philosophers, even those who knew the Lewisian corpus fairly well,
changed the way they read Lewis. There has also been a minor flurry of
work on how important the Gödel/Schmidt case is to the argument of
*Naming and Necessity* [@Devitt2010; @Ichikawa2010; @Machery2012].

But that's nothing compared to the bombshell that is *Philosophy Without
Intuitions*. (Cappelen 2012; all page citations, unless otherwise noted,
to this book.) Herman Cappelen shows, extremely convincingly to my eyes
at least, that intuitions play a much smaller role in late analytic
philosophy than many philosophers thought. Indeed, there is a lot of
textual evidence both for the claim that intuitions don't do much
philosophical work, and for the claim that many people have said that
they do. The first of these claims is all to the good, says Cappelen,
since there isn't a particularly good epistemological defence of the use
of intuitions.

The evidence for Cappelen's claims comes in two parts. The first part,
which I won't discuss much here, is an extended argument that words like
'intuitively', or 'counterintuitive', as they appear in philosophical
discourse, don't in general function to pick out, or even draw attention
to, any distinctive kind of mental state we could call an 'intuition'.
The second part argues that when we look at the actual introduction of
thought experiments into late analytic philosophy, we don't see the
appeal to intuitions that many philosophers seem to think go along with
thought experiments. Rather, we see a whole host of interesting
philosophical moves. Sometimes a thought experiment functions to
highlight an explanandum. Sometimes it gives us a *prima facie*
plausible thesis that we then argue for (or against) at great length.
Sometimes it just raises a puzzle.

One upshot of this historical work, one that Cappelen I think does a
good job highlighting, is that contemporary philosophy is much more
*interesting* than its practitioners sometimes take it to be. Philosophy
is a way of investigating hard questions about the world, often at great
expense in terms of human capital, but with thankfully little in the way
of other expenses. It isn't a matter of tidying up conceptual space.
Thinking of philosophy this way should, I think, help us see why so many
different kinds of projects are philosophically important.

### Centrality and Its Discontents {#sec:Centrality}

The big goal of Cappelen's book is to refute the view, which he dubs
Centrality, that intuitions (of a certain kind) are central to analytic
philosophy, and in particular that they are a primary source of evidence
for analytic philosophers. The intuitions that he has in mind have these
three characteristics. (The quotes are from pages 112-3, where these
features are articulated.)

F1: Phenomenology

:   "An Intuitive Judgment has a distinctive phenomenology" .

F2: Rock

:   "An intuitive judgment has a special epistemic status ...Intuitive
    judgments justify, but they need no justification".

F3: Conceptual

:   A judgment is an intuition "only if it is justified solely by the
    subjects' conceptual competence".

There's some more detail on F2, but we'll get to that in section
[6](#sec:Fragile){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:Fragile"}. And
there's a fourth characteristic of intuitions that I want to add.

F4: Speed

:   Intuitions are rapid reactions..[^1]

I'm going to spend much of this paper defending a view that intuitions
characterised by F2 and F4 do play a role, though perhaps not a
*central* role, in philosophy. But I do think that intuitions
characterised by F1 and F3 are just not important to philosophy. Indeed,
I think it's a very important fact that they are not that important.

The claim that intuitions have a distinctive phenomenology is mostly
harmless but, it seems to me, false. I certainly don't find anything in
common when I introspect my judgments that, say, no set is a member of
itself, or that losing a limb would seriously reduce my happiness, or
that the only language I think in is English. It will fall out of the
view I'm defending that the best intuitions have no phenomenology, but I
don't think that's a particularly important fact about them.

But the claim that intuitions derive solely from conceptual
competencies, plus the claim that these are the central source of
evidence in philosophy, is both wrong and dangerous. If that conjunction
were true, we'd expect most philosophical conclusions to be conceptual
truths (whatever those are). I'm not going to take a stand on whether
there are conceptual truths, but I think it is pretty obvious that
conceptual truths won't help much resolve the following debates.
(Compare the list E1-E6 on pages 200-201, which I'm basically just
extending.)

-   Do bans on pornography involve trading off speech rights versus
    welfare considerations, or do they just involve evaluating the free
    speech interests of different groups?

-   Is it permissible to eat whales?

-   Under what circumstances is it permissible to end a terminally ill
    patient's life, or to withhold life-saving treatment?

-   Is all context dependency in language traceable to the presence of
    bindable variables?

-   Does belief have a phenomenology?

-   Which animals (and which non-animals) have beliefs?

If philosophy uses largely conceptual evidence, these aren't
philosophical questions. More generally, if Centrality (in Cappelen's
sense) is true of philosophy, then feminist philosophy, legal
philosophy, political philosophy, bioethics, philosophy of language and
(most of) philosophy of mind are not part of philosophy. (This list is
far from exhaustive; making philosophy Centrality-friendly would involve
writing out huge swathes of the discipline.)

Modus tollens obviously beckons. But as Cappelen notes (213), one
occasional reaction to this is to identify certain parts of philosophy
as the 'Core' of the discipline, and say Centrality is true of those. If
Centrality is true of the core of philosophy, then feminist philosophy
*etc*., are not part of the core of the field. Maybe now some people
would be disposed to use modus ponens not modus tollens.

That would be a large mistake. It would have shocked Plato, and Locke,
and Hume, and practically every other major figure in the history of
philosophy to learn that political philosophy wasn't central to the
field. I do think (contra some of what Cappelen says) that some
philosophy involves a priori and conceptual investigation. Indeed, I
even do some of it. But it's not true that when I'm doing that I'm doing
work that's deeper, or more philosophical, or more central to philosophy
than the work that, for example, Rae Langton or Susan Moller Okin or
Tamar Szabó Gendler or Sarah-Jane Leslie do.

This reason alone suffices for me to hope that Cappelen's book has a
very wide readership. Centrality isn't true, but it is I think widely
believed to true of at least some parts of the field. (Cappelen quotes
many people endorsing this view.) I suspect that on the basis of this
mistake, the parts of philosophy about which Centrality is not obviously
false (especially metaphysics and epistemology) have been seen as more
central to the discipline than they really ought to be. That's not a bad
state of affairs for metaphysicians and epistemologists, but it's not
good for philosophy, and I hope that Cappelen's book helps put a stop to
it.

### Intuitions in Detective Work {#sec:Detective}

Despite my very broad sympathy with Cappelen's project, I do think
there's a role for intuitions of some kind in philosophy. Just what this
kind is, and what this role is, will take some spelling out to avoid
Cappelen's arguments. So that's what I'll do for the next few pages.

The intuitions I have in mind are characterised by F2 and F4; they are
default justified, and they are fast. Here's how I think these kinds of
intuitions could matter philosophically.

When humans are growing up, they develop a lot of cognitive skills. Some
of these skills are grounded in specific bits of propositional
knowledge. We learn to count in part by learning that 2 comes after 1,
and 3 comes after 2, and so on. But not all of them are. We learn how to
tell causation from correlation, at least in simple cases, by developing
various heuristics, none of which come close to a full theory of
causation. Indeed, none of these heuristics would even be true, if
stated as universal generalisations. But this ability to pick out which
of the many predecessors of an event is its cause is one we develop very
early [@Gopnik2009 33-44], and it is vital to navigating the world.

I think we develop a lot of skills like that; skills which either go
beyond our propositional knowledge, or at the very least are hard to
articulate in terms of propositions. That we have these kinds of skills
should hardly be news to philosophers; under the label 'heuristics' they
have become quite familiar thanks to the work of, among others, Daniel
Kahneman. They occasionally get a bad press, because one central way in
which psychologists detect them is by seeing where they lead to errors
that careful thought would correct. (For instance, our heuristics
sometimes say that a conjunction is more probable than one of the
conjuncts, and careful thinking would correct this.) But this should not
blind us to the fact that these incredibly fast heuristics are often
very reliable; reliable enough to be an independent check on our
theorising.

The use of the term 'intuition' to pick out these heuristics isn't
particularly idiosyncratic; @Kahneman2011 himself moves back and forth
freely between the two terms. He approvingly cites Herbert Simon's
remark that "intuition is nothing more and nothing less than
recognition", which I think is basically right. We intuit that $a$ is
$F$ by recognising that it has the tell-tale signs of $F$hood. Of course
we're a million miles from conceptual or *a priori* reasoning here; as I
said, I agree entirely with Cappelen that F3 is not a feature of any
philosophically significant source of evidence. Here are a couple of
cases, one real life and one fictional, that draw out far removed
intuitive thinking can be from a priori or conceptual thinking. The
first is from Kahneman's description of a case reported by Gary
@Klein1999; the second is from (Norwegian) crime novelist Jo @Nesbo2009.
First Kahneman,

> A team of firefighters entered a house in which the kitchen was on
> fire. Soon after they started hosing down the kitchen, the commander
> heard himself shout "Let's get out of here!" without realizing why.
> The floor collapsed almost immediately after the firefighters escaped.
> Only after the fact did the commander realize that the fire had been
> unusually quiet and that his ears had been unusually hot \... He had
> no idea what was wrong, but he knew something was wrong.
> [@Kahneman2011 11]

Now Nesbø. In the story, Harry is the hero, Harry Hole, and Beate is a
talented forensic detective.

> 'Forget what you have or haven't got,' Harry said. 'What was your
> first impression? Don't think, speak.'
>
> Beate smiled. She knew Harry now. First, intuition, then the facts.
> Because intuition provides facts too; it's all the information the
> crime scene gives you, but which the brain cannot articulate straight
> off. [@Nesbo2009 126]

There's at least a family resemblence between Harry Hole's instruction
here and Lewis's instruction to his readers at the start of "Elusive
Knowledge" [@Lewis1996b].

> If you are a contented fallibilist, I implore you to be honest, be
> naive, hear it afresh. 'He knows, yet he has not eliminated all
> possibilities of error.' Even if you've numbed your ears, doesn't this
> overt, explicit fallibilism still sound wrong? [@Lewis1996b 550]

Reviewers of Nesbø's books often describe his hero as 'intuitive'.
That's a little misleading; Harry Hole thinks intuition has a key role
to play in detective work, but the adjective suggests that he relies
heavily on his own intuition. That's not right; he's just as often
badgering his colleagues to give him their impressions of a crime scene,
or an interview subject. In these scenes he reminds me of no one so much
as a colleague constantly wanting to know what one thinks about some
thought experiment or variation on a familiar case. (These are often the
best kind of colleague - full of inspiring ideas!)

So I think a lot of philosophical progress is made by drawing on, and
drawing out, these skills. But isn't this just to say something
uncontroversial and uninteresting, namely that philosophy relies on
implicit knowledge? As Cappelen puts it,

> It is not controversial that conversations have propositions in the
> common ground. Nor is it controversial that all arguments start with
> premises that are not argued for. (155)

Well, there's something a bit interesting here, namely that the 'common
ground' and the 'not argued for' premises have much greater overlap in
philosophy than in other fields. A book starting with observations about
the Galápagos Islands starts with premises that are not argued for, but
are asserted on the basis of observations. These premises surely weren't
in the common ground before the 'conversation' starts. I'll say more
about this in the next section.

Because first I want to fuss a little about just what 'common ground'
is. We'll start with an observation Cappelen makes about the
Ginet/Goldman case of Henry and the fake barns [@Goldman1976]. Many
philosophers take it to be an interesting fact that in one scenario,
Henry knows there's a barn, while in another he does not. Cappelen says
that these facts are "presented as being pre-theoretically in the common
ground" (172). That seems false at first blush. Before reading Goldman's
paper, it's not clear philosophers are in a position to form singular
thoughts about Henry. That's an uncharitable reading though. A more
plausible claim is to say that we are pre-theoretically disposed to
accept some long sentence that roughly says that an agent in
such-and-such scenario knows there is a barn, while an agent in a
slightly different scenario does not.

We might gloss that last claim as saying that we implicitly knew
something about these scenarios. I'm not sure that's right though. We do
surely have lots of implicit knowledge. I know, and so do you, that the
Sydney Opera House is south of the Royal Albert Hall, even if you'd
never articulated that thought to yourself or another. But do our
dispositions to respond to quite finely drawn, and often reasonably
long, vignettes count as implicit beliefs, or should they count as
things we were in a position to know, but only learned once a
philosopher had done the work of drawing the vignette? I can see merit
in both positions, and don't see firm grounds for preferring one.

Let's introduce some terminology to avoid taking a stance on this
question. Say that a subject has *Socratic knowledge* that $p$ when the
following two conditions are met:

1.  Once the agent is asked to consider $p$ in the right way, they will
    come to know $p$.

2.  The evidential basis for this knowledge that $p$ is not the asking
    itself.

The first clause says that anyone who reacts to a Gettier case with "Oh,
of course that's justified true belief without knowledge" has Socratic
knowledge that such a case is a counterexample to the JTB theory of
knowledge. And they have this Socratic knowledge before the case is even
raised. The second clause says that if the person reacts instead with
"Oh, some philosophers use thought experiments that don't make sense
unless you know which cars come from which countries", that *won't*
count as Socratic knowledge. They would be expressing some knowledge, to
be sure, but the telling of the example would play an evidential role.

If you are very liberal about which dispositions count as implicit
beliefs, and implicit knowledge, then Socratic knowledge will just be a
special kind of implicit knowledge. But if you think considering
examples can lead to learning new facts, not just drawing out
dispositions, then you will think 'Socratic' is like 'alleged', a
non-factive modifier. As I've defined it, once you hear Gettier cases
once, that they are counterexamples to the JTB theory ceases to be
Socratic knowledge, and becomes regular knowledge. Note also that we can
make sense of some implicit states being more or less Socratic than
others; some dispositions to assent require very careful work to
trigger.

Why is the class of propositions that we Socratically know so rich and
fertile? It's because of the central role of heuristics in our cognitive
lives. Our interactions with the world don't just furnish us with a set
of truths about the world. They also furnish us with skills that we can
apply to generate more truths. I suspect that something like this
observation is at the heart of the endorsement of F3, that intuitions
reveal conceptual truths. When we intuit that $p$, we don't always
merely recall a prior belief that $p$, or infer $p$ from what we
antecedently explicitly knew. But nor do we observe that $p$. So what is
it? It must be something internal, but not memory or inference.
Conceptual competence isn't a bad first guess, but Cappelen shows that
isn't the right answer. I think the right answer has to do with
cognitive skills, i.e., heuristics.

### Philosophy: A Negative Characterisation {#sec:Negative}

So intuitions matter because they reveal Socratic knowledge, and
Socratic knowledge, when made explicit, is a very good guide to the
world. That implies that intuitions should not be confined to
philosophy. And, indeed, they are not. If an economic theorist claimed
the standard of living among English men was higher in 1915 than in
1935, it would be perfectly reasonable to reply that intuitively that
cannot be right, because in 1915 a rather large number of English men
were living on the Western Front in catastrophically poor conditions.
What is distinctive of philosophy then?

We need to clarify this question before we can answer it. Philosophy is
both a discipline with a history over many millennia, and an
organisational unit inside modern universities. These two things overlap
well, but not perfectly. Once we note that they are distinct, we can
separate out the following three questions.

1.  What questions are philosophical questions?

2.  What questions are, within the academy, primarily addressed by
    researchers in philosophy departments?

3.  What questions should be, at least within the academy, primarily
    addressed by researchers in philosophy departments?

The three questions don't overlap. When Milton @Friedman1953 writes
about economic methodology, I think he's addressing a philosophical
question, but work like this is, and probably should be, carried out in
economics departments. Questions about professional ethics are
philosophical questions that I think should be researched in philosophy
departments, but in the United States at least typically receive more
attention in professional schools. Let's focus on the third question;
what should a philosophy department do?

My colleagues at Michigan and St Andrews work on an incredibly wide
range of questions, from the interpretation of quantum physics through
history of logic through moral psychology and so on. And I think
philosophy departments should have this range of interests. But what do
all these questions have in common?

It's not anything to do with necessity or a priority. Those categories
seriously cross cut philosophy, as Cappelen points out. Historical
investigations into disputes about the parentage of various
might-have-been-royals, or mathematical investigation into the nature of
the primes are not philosophical, but have to do with necessity and a
priority. Whether there's a language of thought is contingent, a
posteriori, and almost paradigmatically philosophical.

It's not really anything to do with *depth*, at least on a natural
understanding of that. Why pandas have thumbs, and humans have
appendices, turn out to be reasonably deep questions, but they are for
biologists, not philosophers. Under what circumstances is democracy
compatible with a strong executive is, at least to me, an incredibly
deep and important question, but it's a question to be answered,
primarily, in history and political science departments.[^2] On the
other hand, whether we can tell a plausible supervaluationist story
about belief reports is not particularly deep, but a perfectly good
subject for a philosophical inquiry as in @Weatherson2003-WEAMMP.

Better, I think, is to say that philosophical questions are those where
implicit or Socratic knowledge, including crucially intuitions, can
plausibly play a large role in getting to an answer. Philosophy is a
little recursive, so it includes investigations into its own
investigations, including historical work and metaphilosophical work.
(Two fields which, prior to Cappelen's book, had surprisingly little
interaction.) That's not to say we're always right that Socratic
knowledge can answer the questions philosophy sets. Maybe some questions
in mind and language are best answered with the aid of neurological or
phonological work that requires powerful measuring devices. But the
questions are ones where starting with the knowledge and skills we
already have seems like a plausible starting point, or at least not
entirely crazy. This makes philosophy distinct from, say, history. We
use intuitions in history too, especially intuitions about what explains
what. But we need more; intuition won't help if you want to know how
many troops Henry had at Agincourt.

This hypothesis explains, I think, one of the historically important
facts about philosophy. Philosophy gives birth to disciplines. Physics,
economics, psychology and cognitive science were all, at one time, part
of philosophy. In some cases, the split was very recent. The economics
tripos at Cambridge only split from philosophy in 1903 [@Tribe2002]. The
*Australasian Journal of Philosophy* was the *Australasian Journal of
Psychology and Philosophy* until 1946. Why does philosophy give rise to
disciplines like these?

I think having a negative characterisation of philosophy helps explain
it. Philosophy has a lot in common, methodologically, with physics,
economics, psychology and so on. All those fields use intuitions and
other forms of Socratic knowledge. But the other fields use other things
too, especially observation. It's when it becomes clear that armchair
methods play too small a role in the research that the field leaves
philosophy.

Of course, philosophers care more about their questions than their
methods, so when the need for non-armchair methods becomes pressing,
some of the individual philosophers will go along, picking up more and
more observational knowledge and experimental skills. Note how much more
empirical research informs the recent work by (for example) Gilbert
Harman, Kim Sterelny and Peter Carruthers, compared to their earlier
work
[@Harman1973; @Harman2011; @DevittSterelny1987; @Sterelny2012; @Carruthers1990; @Carruthers2011].
From the other direction, our armchairs come with more knowledge now
than they used to, which is partially why engaging with Laura Ruetsche's
work in philosophy of science requires more empirical knowledge engaging
with William Whewell's [@Ruetsche2011; @Whewell1840]. But still I think
the general picture holds; a question is fit for philosophy iff it is
plausible that the intuitive, armchair methods which are part of every
academic's toolkit can, on their own, generate serious progress on the
question.

### Letting Go {#sec:Go}

I've said that Lewis's instruction at the start of "Elusive Knowledge"
is to look to intuitions, not to theoretical beliefs. But that might
involve reading more into Lewis than is really there. What he literally
asks the reader is to not appeal to their preferred theory of knowledge.
Is that the same as an appeal to intuitions?

It need not always be. Sometimes, asking people to let go of their prior
theory involves asking them to engage in a complex cognitive task. In
Meditation One, Descartes has us go through quite a lot of thoughts
before we can be pre-theoretical in the way he wants us to be.

But I don't think that's what's going on with Lewis. For one thing, he
doesn't guide us back to a pre-theoretic naı̈veté the way Descartes does.
But more generally, I think getting snap judgments is a way of letting
go of some prior theories.

The picture I have here, and it is nothing more than a picture, is that
intuitions are judgments delivered by heuristics, heuristics are
deployed by Fodorian modules, and Fodorian modules are informationally
encapsulated [@Fodor1983; @Fodor2000]. That is, when we rely on a
heuristic, we don't use all of the information at our disposal. The
classic example of this is eyesight; we may know that there are no
elephants on Market Street in St Andrews, but given the right visual
stimuli, our eyes will still insist that there is an elephant *right
there*. The background theory about the spatial distribution of
elephants isn't encoded into the visual module. More generally, to rely
on a heuristic just is to make a judgment using a part of our mind that
doesn't believe some of the things that we do. And that's good, because
it is a kind of independent check on the beliefs we have.[^3]

But isn't the idea that snap judgments are essential to philosophy
inconsistent with the fact that we work very hard on getting our
examples just right, and (as Cappelen shows), argue at great length over
what to say about various examples? I think it isn't, because there are
two respects in which our practice reveals a sensitivity to snap
judgments, and a respect for their use as a check on theorising.

Let me tell you a small secret. I haven't heard anything that even
sounds like a counterexample to the broadly Stalnakerian theory of
indicative conditionals that I like for about a decade. That's not
because there aren't any intuitive counterexamples. It's just because my
intuitions have been trained to accord with this kind of theory.[^4] So
what do I do? Do I give up on the use of intuitions as a test of theory?
No, I ask colleagues for their intuitions. Sometimes I ask them a lot of
different questions, and sometimes I work rather hard on refining the
question, or (when they sadly disagree with my theory) finding ways to
undermine their intuitions. Given the number of similar questions I get
from other colleagues, I don't think my methodology here is distinctive.
In short, we can work very hard before and after getting the snap
judgments, while giving those judgments a role.

This might be more idiosyncratic, but I also do a bunch of things in
papers to draw out snap judgments. The main idea is to distract the
reader from the fact that they are about to be prompted for an
intuition, one that may not accord with their preferred theory. So I'll
use deliberately absurd props (like Vinny the talking vulture), or start
an example without flagging that it is an example. My favourite move
along these lines is to set up an example in such a way that the example
doesn't make sense unless some theoretical claim I want to argue for is
true. Then, after much discussion of the correct verdict on the case, I
can announce that the very sensibility of the prior discussion is proof
that, at least intuitively, the theory I'm pushing must be true.

We're going to come back to this theme a bit later, because I think it's
rather important. The cases you can remember from papers are probably
not the ones where intuition mattered. The big role for intuition in
philosophy (and in many other disciplines) is in checking the small
steps along the way. That's why I join Cappelen in opposing the
methodological rationalists; I don't think intuitions are distinctive to
philosophy, and these small steps don't have much of a phenomenology.
But that doesn't mean they are unimportant.

### Strength and Fragility {#sec:Fragile}

One of the big trends in late 20th Century epistemology has been the
separation of two senses of *strength of evidence*. This might mean

1.  How strong a doxastic state is supported by the evidence.

2.  How resilient the force of the evidence is in the face of
    counterevidence.

One thing that conservative epistemologies (e.g., @Harman1986) and
dogmatic epistemologies (e.g., @Pryor2000) have in common is that
sources which might be very strong in the first sense might be very weak
in the second sense. In particular, there can be sources of evidence
that ground knowledge, and hence be rather strong in tthe first sense,
but easily overturned by conflicting evidence. I prefer to reserve the
terms 'strong' and 'weak' for the first sense, and use the terms
'resilient' or 'fragile' for the presence or absence of the second
property. In that language, the important insight of the conservatives
and dogmatists is that evidence can be strong but fragile.

That's roughly how I think of intuitions -- they are strong but rather
fragile. So they can be unjustified justifiers, which is how I read
Cappelen's feature F2 (i.e., Rock).[^5]

Cappelen notes it is hard to tell whether something is being used as a
starting point, or an unjustified justifier, so he gives three
diagnostics for this. I mostly agree with one, and disagree with the
other two. I agree that intuitions are non-inferential, and they aren't
based on any particular experience, which is his criteria F2.1. (Though
they usually are based on experiences taken collectively.) But I would
alter the following suggestion, which he gives as a second diagnostic.

> F2.2 **Evidence Recalcitrance**: Intuitions are evidence recalcitrant;

I would rather offer something normative here. What's true of intuitions
is that they might provide a stronger ground for belief than the best
evidence we can offer for them. Compare the case of Gettier. As Cappelen
carefully notes (194n3), Gettier doesn't appeal to a raw intuition. He
gives an argument that his subjects don't know. Unfortunately, it isn't
a compelling argument, since it takes as a premise that we can't get
knowledge from a false belief, and that isn't quite right
[@Warfield2005]. But Gettier was, to some extent, justified in believing
these subjects didn't know to a greater degree than he was justified in
believing this argument was sound. And that, I think, is not uncommon.

This is why I don't think Cappelen's 'Rough Guide to Rock Detection'
(121), the third of the diagnostics, is perfectly reliable. He says that
if evidence is given for $p$ in a context, that's evidence that $p$
isn't an unjustified justifier in that context. But sometimes we give
arguments for judgments that we think could rest without them. Compare
this little dialogue.

> A: Is 'John happiness' a well-formed sentence?
>
> B: No; it doesn't have a verb.

Here B gives a judgment, then offers a little argument for it. The
argument has a strong premise, namely that all sentences have verbs.
That's debatable; 'Lo, gavagai!' may be a counterexample. But B's
judgment isn't undermined by examples that undermine her argument. As in
the Gettier case, we may give an argument that doesn't capture the full
normative force of the judgment.

To say that intuitions are unjustified justifiers is not to say they are
particularly special. If some conservative or dogmatic epistemology is
true, there will be other unjustified justifiers. And if not, then this
story about intuitions will be pretty implausible.

This picture of intuitions as strong but fragile meshes well, I think,
with the picture from section [5](#sec:Go){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:Go"}. There I said the important intuitions are the ones
you barely notice or remember. That's because the intuitions are
fragile; if you remembered them enough to argue about them (or
experimentally test them), the fragility conditions had probably been
triggered, and the intuition probably wasn't doing much argumentative
work.[^6]

But why not think that intuitions are so fragile that they have no use
in any philosophical debate? This question deserves more space than I
can give it, but here are three sketches of answers.

1.  Intuitions might be valuable checks on theory, and might be
    resilient enough to perform a valuable checking role.

2.  Just like heuristics have characteristic errors, it might be that
    careful reasoning has characteristic errors, and there are cases
    where our first impressions are more reliable. See @GladwellBlink
    for a summary of some relevant evidence.

3.  Somewhat surprisingly, there may be cases when it is best to trust
    the less reliable source. The case for this is a bit detailed, and
    not original to me, so I'll just include a brief footnote for those
    interested.[^7]

### Some Lewisian Case Studies {#sec:Lewis}

I've described one kind of mental state that deserves the name
'intuition', and which could play a role in philosophical activity. But,
as Cappelen presses, we have to work to convert that 'could' to a
'does'. Do we really rely in intuitive, or heuristic-driven, judgments
about cases in analytic philosophy?

As Cappelen shows, the answer is "A lot less than you may have guessed."
We argue a lot more than we intuit, especially about the famous
cases.[^8] The bit of analytic philosophy I'm most familiar with is
David Lewis's corpus, and since that doesn't play much of a role in
Cappelen's story, I'll illustrate his point with some examples from it.

Going from memory, I would have guessed the clearest example of a case
refuting a theory was the use of finkish dispositions to refute the
conditional analysis of dispositions. But go to the opening pages of
"Finkish Dispositions" [@Lewis1997b], and you find not an intuition
about a case, but an argument that finks are possible. And even though
that argument is followed up with more cases, Lewis rather explicitly
*argues* for his conclusions about each one. See, for example, the glass
loving sorcerer on page 147. Lewis doesn't avert to an intuition that
the loved glass is fragile, rather he "wield[s] an assumption that
dispositions are an intrinsic matter." [@Lewis1997b 147]

The discussion of causation turns out to be a little more fertile. From
(the longer version of) "Causation as Influence", I count the following
appeals to intuitions about cases.

-   The chancy bomb example which shows simple probabilistic analyses of
    indeterministic causation won't work [@Lewis2004a 79].

-   The Merlin and Morgana example which shows that trumping is
    possible, and matters for what is the cause [@Lewis2004a 81].

-   The variant on Billy and Suzy that raises problems for
    quasi-dependence [@Lewis2004a 83].

-   The crazed President example which shows that causation by double
    prevention is possible, and that causation is not an intrinsic
    relation [@Lewis2004a 84].

-   The Frankfurt example which shows we can have causation without
    dependence [@Lewis2004a 95].

There's a strong sense, I think, in which none of the judgments in these
cases are argued for. Indeed, they arise as *problems* for theories that
are otherwise doing rather well. If there was an argument around, it
would be for the negation of the intuited judgment. So I think there's a
role for intuition here.

But we should not imagine that this is normal for philosophers, or even
for Lewis. Cases, it is true, play a large role in Lewis's writing. But
they are very rarely simple refutations of existing theories. We could
perhaps distinguish four roles that cases play, or perhaps four types of
philosophical cases.

1.  Refutation of theories, as in these causation cases.

2.  Illustrations that help explain what's going on in an argument, as
    in the examples from "Finkish Dispositions". For a more extensive
    version of this, see Lewis's version of Puzzling Pierre
    [@Lewis1981d].

3.  Tools for showing that we must distinguish various concepts, such as
    the discussion of Ned Kelly's proof that there's no honest cop
    [@Lewis1988f].

4.  Simplified versions of the real world, on which we can test various
    explanatory hypotheses, such as the footy and rugby people in
    "Naming the Colors" [@Lewis1997c].

And that list is probably incomplete. The last is fairly fascinating as
a case study actually.[^9] Some of you may have had the following
experience when programming, or indeed doing anything that looks like
working with code (such as writing in LaTeX). A bug arises. It helps to
find a minimal example in which the bug arises, i.e., a smallest program
that produces the same bug. This helps you spot what's going on, and if
you still need help, it helps your interlocutors focus on the central
problem. It's important that you haven't changed the problem; the
example must be of the same kind as what you started with. But the
example could be much simpler than the case you're most interested in.
Some philosophy examples are, I suspect, like that. Their value lies in
revealing that some striking feature of reality would persist even if
the world were simpler. So, probably, the explanation of the feature
lies in some respect the real messy world shares with the simple example
world. (Compare Cappelen's discussion of Perry's messy shopper in
section 8.1.)

It is perhaps no coincidence that the easiest place to find examples of
type 1 in Lewis's work is in the papers on causation. Lewis thinks there
is no such thing as causation [@Lewis2004a; @Lewis2004d]. Whatever our
theory of 'causes' should be, it shouldn't match that verb with a binary
property. Rather, the aim of philosophical work on causation is to give
a reductive analysis of causal thought and talk. In such a project,
judgments about how we use 'causes' are more likely to be central.

It's also not coincidental that when an example is central to a paper,
such as the 'dishonest' cop and Puzzled Pierre, they really don't look
like type 1. That's one big and important lesson from Cappelen's work.
Philosophers do use examples to refute theories, but they are rarely the
big famous examples. If an example is central to a philosophy paper, it
typically plays one of the other three roles.

### Summary {#sec:Summary}

Let's take stock. I've argued for the following theses:

1.  Socratic knowledge is important to philosophy.

2.  The distinctive feature of philosophy is that it addresses questions
    that can, at least *prima facie*, be productively worked on while
    relying primarily on Socratic knowledge.

3.  Intuitions are manifestations of cognitive skills, and much Socratic
    knowledge is constituted by the possession of such cognitive skills.

4.  Like other
    forms of Socratic knowledge, intuitions are mostly *a posteriori*,
    and have roles outside philosophy as well as inside it.

5.  Intuitions are default justified; that is, they can be unjustified
    justifiers.

6.  This default is very weak; intuitions can easily be overridden by
    other considerations.

7.  Relatedly,
    it is rare for any one intuition to be central to a philosophical
    work; philosophical intuitions mostly concern the little cases we
    see along the way to larger projects.

I also hinted at, without developing, an argument for

8.  The right intuition can stop even a plausible theory dead in its
    tracks; and we have (thanks to Ben Levinstein) a mathematical model
    for why this can be so even if intuitions are much less reliable
    than theories.

I opened with a discussion of why it matters to philosophy's
self-conception that point 4 is correct. Since Cappelen also endorses
4, I probably don't need to say more about that
here. But I think there is more to say about 7.

The first thing I want to note is that
7 is of course consistent with Cappelen's
textual research on important work in late analytic philosophy. In just
about any thought experiment that you can remember, the intuitions about
it don't carry much philosophical weight in the work in which it is
introduced. The intuitions that matter are the little ones, the ones
that go by so quickly that no one questions them and are largely
forgotten by all but the *cognoscenti* in that field. Even these
intuitions aren't *that* common. There are less of them in Lewis than I
would have guessed.

Still, I disagree with Cappelen that philosophy is without these
intuitions. And so I disagree that there's no role for double checking,
experimentally if need be, whether these intuitions are really
intuitive. If a well run survey showed that most people disagree with
Lewis's judgment about, say, the chancy bombs example, I'd reconsider my
views about probabilistic causation. But I'd be really surprised to see
this.

The second thing to note is that while
7 is true, it's not the case that intuitions
about one case are never central to a philosophical project. There is
one big counterexample: the Gettier literature. Like Cappelen (194n3), I
think this literature is incredibly unrepresentative of philosophy. And
I think that's in part because it was methodologically flawed. I tried
to make this point in an earlier paper [@Weatherson2003-WEAWGA], but I
didn't get it quite right. (What I should have said was more like what
Elijah @Chudnoff2011 does say.) When we saw the Gettier example, this
should have been an invitation to try and find out what feature of
knowledge was driving the fact that the belief in the main examples
didn't amount to knowledge. Gettier suggested it was inference from a
false premise, but that doesn't quite work [@Warfield2005]. You might
think it is insensitivity, but that doesn't quite work. At this point
there should have been one of two paths taken - attempts to find some
other explanation of the data, or a reconsideration of whether our
initial judgment about the case was wrong. That's what the picture of
philosophy sketched here would have predicted, and (this is the point I
was trying but failing to make in the earlier paper) that's what
reflection on our successes in other areas of philosophy would have
recommended. But the first kind of project ended up intertwined with
attempts to analyse knowledge, and stalled for decades. And the second
project wasn't seriously undertaken, with some honorable exceptions such
as @Sartwell1992 and @Hetherington2001. Now eventually this didn't
matter, because we discovered that safety based explanations of the
Gettier case would work, even if there is no safety based analysis of
knowledge, and even if there is some work to be done in getting the
safety condition just right
[@Williamson1994-WILV; @Williamson2000-WILKAI; @Sainsbury1996; @Lewis1996b; @Weatherson2004-WEALMT].
So if we strengthened
7 into a universal claim it would be false --
thirty years of epistemological struggle attest to this. But it was
really when epistemology fell into line with practice in other fields of
philosophy that it made progress on the Gettier case.

[^1]: My own views about the importance of this, as well as much else in
    this paper, owe a lot to Jennifer @Nagel2007 [@Nagel2013].

[^2]: This is not to say that political philosophers couldn't help with
    this question. There are lots of questions that should have as their
    research centre some other department, but to which philosophers can
    usefully help. Indeed, the examples from economic methodology and
    evolutionary explanation I just mentioned are two more such
    questions.

[^3]: Philosophers sometimes understate the importance of independent
    checks. We can know a scale is working, but if we want to check its
    reliability we don't use it, we use something else. I suspect that a
    certain amount of theory-independence is part of the explanation of
    the value of intuitions.

[^4]: Relatedly, I haven't seen Liverpool get awarded an undeserved free
    kick for about that long.

[^5]: There's an ambiguity in Cappelen's text that I'm not sure I'm
    interpreting the right way. Let's that someone intuits that in a
    particular case, $c$ doesn't cause $e$. Call the content of that
    intuition, i.e., what is *intuited*, $p_d$. And call the proposition
    that the person has this intuition, i.e., the event of the
    intuiting, $p_g$. Plausibly both $p_d$ and $p_g$ could be evidence
    in the right cases, though most of the time the salient evidence
    will be $p_d$. I think $p_d$ can be an unjustified justifier in the
    sense that other beliefs, e.g., that a particular theory of
    causation is false, can be justified on the basis of $p_d$, but no
    other beliefs the agent has justify $p_d$. But you might want a
    stronger sense of 'unjustified', where it means not just not
    justified by anything else, but not justified *at all*. I think in
    these kinds of cases, $p_d$ is justified, just not justified by
    anything else. And the justification is, as I'll get to below,
    strong but fragile. If when Cappelen says that intuitions, according
    to Centrality, are unjustified justifiers he means that the belief
    that $p_d$ is unjustified, then I'm not defending Centrality. I just
    mean that the agent need not have any other mental states which
    justify the belief $p_d$, or indeed any access to anything that
    justifies $p_d$. But for all that it might be that the belief that
    $p_d$ is justified, and the grounds for the justification include
    what the agent learned about causation as a child, plus perhaps her
    competence in distinguishing causes from non-causes.

[^6]: I'm simplifying a little here. My preferred position is that
    intuit*ed*s provide strong but fragile evidence, while intuit*ing*s
    provide weak but resilient evidence. The reason this is relevant is
    related to footnote 7.

[^7]: At one point
    in Ben Levinstein's doctoral dissertation, he considers whether
    there's a general rule for deciding which of two conflicting sources
    we can trust. There turns out to be very little in general one can
    say. In particular, *trust the more reliable source* turns out not
    in general to be good advice. If sources have characteristic errors,
    it might be that given what the two sources have said, it is better
    on this occasion to trust the less reliable source, because the
    verdicts the sources deliver provide evidence that we are seeing one
    of the characteristic errors of the more reliable source. It takes
    more space than I have here to fill in the details of this argument,
    and most of the details I'd include would be Levinstein's not mine.
    But here's the big conclusion. Assume that intuitions are often
    wrong, but rarely dramatically wrong. The reason for that is that
    heuristics are bad at getting things exactly right, and good at
    getting in the ballpark. And that careful reasoning is often right,
    but sometimes dramatically wrong. This is trickier to motivate, but
    I think true. Then when intuition dramatically diverges from theory,
    and we don't have independent reason to think that intuition is
    mistaken about the kind of case that's in question, we should trust
    the intuition more than the theory.

[^8]: There is interesting work to be done on the relative role of
    intuitions and arguments about *principles*, but I'm going to leave
    that for another day, and focus here on cases. The principles/cases
    distinction can be a bit slippery, but paradigm cases are easy to
    identify, and we'll be working with fairly paradigmatic cases here.

[^9]: See @Sugden2000 [@Sugden2009] for much more on this use of thought
    experiments.
