This paper analyzes citation patterns in philosophy journal articles from 1956 to 2024, using Web of Science data from 100 philosophy journals. The analysis reveals two surprising findings. First, contrary to the perception that philosophers cite very old papers, most journal citations have historically been to recently published work—typically articles 3-10 years old. Second, contrary to the expectation that technological advances would make citations younger, the opposite has occurred: citations are getting older. Electronic databases and online access have made older articles more discoverable than they were in the era of card catalogs and physical library visits.

After adjusting for both age effects (when articles are typically cited) and period effects (the dramatic increase in total citations over time), the data reveal significant cohort effects. Two publication periods stand out as particularly influential: the early 1970s and the 2000s. The early-1970s peak reflects the revolutionary transformation of philosophy by Frankfurt, Rawls, Thomson, Kripke, Lewis, and others. The 2000s pattern is more striking. Articles from this time did not immediately upend the field, as happened in the 1970s. Rather, they established a series of new debates that have persisted for decades. The continued high citation rates of 2000s articles reflect the growing centrality of epistemology and the fact that fewer debates from the 2000s have faded from discourse compared to the dramatic decline of 1980s-1990s debates about supervenience, narrow content, and related topics in metaphysics and philosophy of mind.
