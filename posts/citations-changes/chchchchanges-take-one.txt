title: "Changes in Citation Patters"
abstract: |
    Which journal articles are cited surprisingly often in recent times, given how often they were cited soon after publication? Conversely, which articles have a lot more citations soon after publication than you'd expect from their current prominence. This note goes over some data on these questions.

"`r ex1_title`" [`r ex1_bib`] gets talked about a lot in philosophy journals. In a study I did of one hundred prominent philosophy journals, it has been cited `r ex1_latecite` times after `r ex1_crossing`. That's a lot, and it's a lot more than you might have expected in `r ex1_crossing`, at which time it had been cited `r ex1_earlycite` times. Here's one way to get a sense of how much more.

"`r ex1_title`" was published in `r ex1_year`. Papers published in those 100 journals in `r ex1_year` were cited (in the journals I'm studying) `r ex1_yearbefore` times through `r ex1_crossing`. They have been cited `r ex1_yearafter` times since then. So about `r ex1_exppercent` of citations of articles published in `r ex1_year` were in or before `r ex1_crossing`.

Imagine a binomial process, with two options, 'early' and 'late'. We'll run the process `r ex1_allcite` times, one for each citation to "`r ex1_title`". The probability of the process saying 'early' will be `r ex1_exppercent`, since for articles in general published in `r ex1_year`, that's how often their citations are in or before `r ex1_crossing`. How likely is it that we'll end up with `r ex1_earlycite` or fewer of the results being 'early', as actually happened with cites to "`r ex1_title`"?

The answer is not very likely at all. The probability of getting a result this extreme is about 10^-`r round(ex1_earlyprob)`^. I think that meets most tests for statistical significance!

We see a similar pattern with "`r ex2_title`" [`r ex2_bib`]. Through `r ex2_crossing`, it had been cited `r ex2_earlycite` times; since then it has been cited `r ex2_latecite`. In general, articles published in `r ex2_year`, as it was, have about `r ex2_exppercent` of their citations in or before `r ex2_crossing`. The probability of a binominal process with `r ex2_earlycite` + `r ex2_latecite` = `r ex2_allcite` trials, and a probability of saying 'early' of `r ex2_exppercent`, having `r ex2_earlycite` or fewer outcomes of 'early' is about 10^-`r round(ex2_earlyprob)`^. This paper too has many more recent citations than you'd expect, though in this case we're taking 'recent' to mean after `r ex2_crossing`, not `r ex1_crossing`.

I ran this same calculation for every paper in the study with 50 or more citations in philosophy journals, and for every possible division of time into 'early' and 'late' such that the late year was no later than 2018, and there were at least five years after publication which were early.^[My citation data only runs through 2022, so when the cutoff is 2018, that did only leave four years of 'late' data. Less than that really felt like it could be noise.] @tbl-late-bloomers shows the most extreme results.

In @tbl-late-bloomers, 'Cutoff' is the boundary between early and late that's being used in that row. 'Early' is the number of times the paper was cited (in philosophy journals) through that cutoff year, and 'Late' is the number of times it has been cited after that. 'Typical' is the proportion of citations articles published in the year the article was cited through the cutoff year. And Prob is log~10~ of the probability of a binomial process with that probability getting a result that extreme.

I calculated this Prob value for every article with 50 or more citation, and every cutoff from five years after publication to 2018. For each article, I selected the smallest value of Prob. I then selected the 100 articles for which Prob is lowest. Note that I didn't select the 100 pairs of articles-cutoffs for which Prob is lowest. If I'd done that, I would have a list where "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" was repeated ten times at the top.^[The Prob value isn't much changed for any cutoff between 1997 and 2006.] Just including each paper once is a bit more informative.

There are a few reasons why articles might turn up on a list like this.

- Some papers are in topics that are much more central to philosophy now than they were at the time of publication. This is especially true for papers concerned with social and interpersonal topics, such as @WOS000085841900002, @WOSA1977EA35800003, @WOSA1993MJ74900002, and @WOS000170434600004.
- Some papers are important instances of approaches that were not as prominent at the time they were published. This starts at the top of the list; utilitarianism wasn't nearly as prominent in the late twentieth century as in the twenty-first century.
- And, as Eric Schwitzgebel pointed out on an earlier post, in some cases what we're seeing is just the normal pattern of highly cited papers. This is, I think, what's happening with @WOS000234431300006 and @WOS000165361800002. Note that I'm comparing the trends in citations of papers like these to the citations of all papers published the same year. If it takes a while for the literature to settle on what the most important papers are, and after that time the other papers drop away, then papers like these could appear on the list as much by not having their citation rates decay as by becoming particularly more prominent.

What about the other end of the scale? To look at the other end, we create the same binomial distribution, but this time look at articles where it is surprising that there are this few or fewer citations after the cutoff. These are the articles that had a strikingly high number of early citations, given what happened later. The top of that list is shown in @tbl-early-bloomers.

#| tbl-cap: "Papers with more early citations than is typical."

kable(

    mutate(
      Article = paste0(
        displayauth,
        " -",
        bib,
        " \"",
        title,
        "\""
      ),
      Typical = scales::percent(year_before/(year_before + year_after), accuracy = 1),
      Prob = round(late_prob, 1)
    ) |>
    select(Article,
           Cutoff = crossing,
           Early = cites_before,
           Late = cites_after,
           Typical,
           Prob) |>

)
```

Even though I've let the Prob values get a fair bit higher than on @tbl-late-bloomers, the list is still somewhat shorter. I think this is because of the third point above; having a later than usual distribution of citations is par for the course among widely cited articles. That said, there are several more reasons why an article's citations might be weighted towards early citations than that it might be weighted towards late citations.

- The article might get superseded. This happens especially if the same author puts out a later piece that is simply better than the earlier one. I think this is what's going on with @WOSA1978EL93700009; eventually people came to think of later works, such as @WOSA1984TV24600001, as simply better. I suspect it's also true with some of the philosophy of biology papers on this list; that has been a fast moving field, and even very good papers get replaced in the canon by more up to date ones.
- The article might be incorporated into a book, and the citations move to the book. That's pretty clearly what's happened with @WOSA1985APA8500001 and @WOS000262577100002.
- There is a technical issue here with reprints in collected volumes. Web of Science _sometimes_ puts together citations to a paper in a volume with citations in the original journal, but it doesn't always. This also affects the citations to the Kim papers, and I think that's why @WOS000228214500002 is here.
- Sometimes the discipline gets into the habit of citing one paper in lieu of a family of papers that developed a point. So anyone who wants to point in the general direction of Joshua Knobe's mid-2000s work on intention cites @WOS000183806600005, while his other papers from around the same time end up on lists like this.
- And sometimes the discipline just loses interest in a topic. So we have a lot of papers here on intuitions, and on supervenience. After the boom in interest in vagueness in the 2000s, citations to @WOSA1970ZE32000003 and @10.2307_2025110 came back to earth. Even what seemed like completely central issues about modality and about mental content don't seem immune to this.

I think there is an interesting story in how many of the most influential, at least at the time, papers of the 1980s and 1990s are now not playing a major role in philosophical conversations. This did not, on the whole, happen to the other decades. There are obviously plenty of papers from the 1970s and 2000s on @tbl-early-bloomers. But they did not seem, on the whole, to be quite as central to philosophy at their time as the papers on that list from the 1980s or 1990s.^[Or if they are, as @WOS000262577100002 surely was, the reason they are here is because citations to a paper were simply replaced by citations to a book; they didn't just fall away.]

But that's for later work. For now I just wanted to post these lists of which papers were distinctively late bloomers and early bloomers, and offer some tentative suggestions for what the nature of those lists tells us about the last half-century of philosophy.
