title: "Trends in *Philosophical Studies*, 1980-2019"
abstract: |
  *Philosophical Studies* is the most cited journal in English-language philosophy. This essay looks at how it became so central, and how the changes in its subject matter over time reflect changes in English language philosophy. Special attention is paid to the role of special issues of the journal, notably the publication of conference proceedings, and to the rise in papers in social philosophy in the second half of the 2010s.
