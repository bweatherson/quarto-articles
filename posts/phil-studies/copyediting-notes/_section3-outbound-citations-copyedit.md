# Section 3: Outbound Citations - Copyediting Suggestions

## Line 1504: Awkward Phrasing

**Original:**
> Articles in _Philosophical Studies_ get cited a lot. @tbl-all-cites shows the five journals with the largest number of citations of articles published between 1980 and 2019 in the 100 journals we're looking at.

**Issues:**
1. "get cited a lot" is informal
2. "in the 100 journals we're looking at" is awkward and informal

**Suggested Revision:**
> Articles in _Philosophical Studies_ are heavily cited. @tbl-all-cites shows the five journals with the most citations of articles published between 1980 and 2019 within the study's set of 100 journals.

**Alternative:**
> Articles in _Philosophical Studies_ receive substantial citations. @tbl-all-cites shows the five journals with the largest number of citations for articles published between 1980 and 2019 in the journals examined here.

## Line 1530: Citation Format

**Original:**
> Citations tend to follow something like a log-normal distribution [@Brzezinski2015].

**Issue:**
Check if this is the correct citation format for your style. May need year only or other format.

**Suggested Revision:**
(Verify citation format is consistent with your style guide)

---

## Line 1555: Grammar Issue

**Original:**
> From the one hundred journals that I'm primarily looking at, I selected the twenty (including _Philosophical Studies_) that have the highest rate of citations per published article, and which Web of Science has indexed every year since 1980.

**Issues:**
1. "From the one hundred journals that I'm primarily looking at" is wordy
2. "and which" should be "and that" for parallel structure (or restructure)
3. Slightly informal tone

**Suggested Revision:**
> From the 100 journals in this study, I selected the 20 (including _Philosophical Studies_) with the highest rates of citations per published article that Web of Science has indexed continuously since 1980.

---

## Line 1598: Emphasis Formatting

**Original:**
> After 2003, it is consistently doing better than the average journal _in the top 20_.

**Issue:**
Using italics for emphasis here, but "in the top 20" should probably be in roman type, not italics (unless emphasizing for a specific reason)

**Suggested Revision:**
> After 2003, it consistently exceeds the average journal in the top 20.

**Alternative (if you want to keep emphasis):**
> After 2003, it is consistently doing better than the average journal in the top 20. [no italics]

---

## Line 1602: Conditional Verb Issue

**Original:**
> I won't repeat the analysis here, but if build @fig-compare-cites-rolling using median citations, or 75th percentile citations, rather than means, the shape of the graph doesn't change much.

**Issue:**
Missing pronoun: "if **I** build"

**Suggested Revision:**
> I won't repeat the analysis here, but if I build @fig-compare-cites-rolling using median citations, or 75th percentile citations, rather than means, the shape of the graph doesn't change much.

**Alternative (more concise):**
> Using median or 75th percentile citations instead of means produces a similar graph shape.

---

## Line 1606: Parenthetical Clarity

**Original:**
> @tbl-citation-by-type shows three summary statistics, mean, median, and 75th percentile (Q3), for the normal _Philosophical Studies_ issues, and for the four classes of special issues. @tbl-citation-by-type-decade shows the means for the five classes over each of the four decades from 1980-2019. (The blank cells mean that there aren't any special issues of that type that decade.)

**Issues:**
1. Could use serial commas for clarity
2. "that decade" could be "in that decade"
3. Two sentences could be better connected

**Suggested Revision:**
> @tbl-citation-by-type shows three summary statistics—mean, median, and 75th percentile (Q3)—for normal _Philosophical Studies_ issues and for the four classes of special issues. @tbl-citation-by-type-decade shows the means for the five classes over each of the four decades from 1980-2019. (Blank cells indicate that no special issues of that type appeared in that decade.)

## Line 1624: Repetition and Clarity

**Original:**
> The high average isn't being caused by outliers, but many BSPC articles being cited very frequently.

**Issue:**
Awkward construction: "but many BSPC articles being cited" should be "but by many BSPC articles being cited"

**Suggested Revision:**
> The high average is not caused by outliers but by many BSPC articles being cited very frequently.

**Alternative:**
> The high average stems not from outliers but from many BSPC articles receiving frequent citations.

---

## Line 1658: Inconsistent Spacing

**Original:**
> I looked at the most cited article since 2005 in each of the 20 journals that go into  @fig-means-normal-only,

**Issue:**
Double space before "@fig-means-normal-only"

**Suggested Revision:**
> I looked at the most cited article since 2005 in each of the 20 journals that go into @fig-means-normal-only,

---

## Line 1660: Informal Transition

**Original:**
> Rather than go further down this rabbit hole, let's turn to what was in _Philosophical Studies_ over the years, starting with its inbound citations.

**Issues:**
1. "go further down this rabbit hole" is too informal for academic writing
2. "let's turn" is conversational
3. Transition could be more professional

**Suggested Revision:**
> Rather than pursuing this line of inquiry further, I now examine what _Philosophical Studies_ published over the years, beginning with its inbound citations.

**Alternative:**
> Setting aside this complexity, I turn now to the content of _Philosophical Studies_ over the years, starting with its inbound citations.

## Section Heading Issue

### Line 1662: Typo in Section Heading

**Original:**
> # Inbound Citatations {#sec-inbound-citations}

**Issue:**
Typo: "Citatations" should be "Citations"

**Suggested Revision:**
> # Inbound Citations {#sec-inbound-citations}

---

## Caption Issues

### Line 1508: Caption Clarity

**Original:**
> "Leading journals by total number of citations (Articles published 1980-2019)."

**Issue:**
Parenthetical could be smoother

**Suggested Revision:**
> Leading journals by total citations for articles published 1980-2019.

---

### Line 1520: Similar Caption Issue

**Original:**
> "Leading journals by total number of articles (Articles published 1980-2019)."

**Suggested Revision:**
> Leading journals by article count for articles published 1980-2019.

---

### Line 1536: Caption Issue

**Original:**
> "Leading journals by citation rate (Articles published 1980-2019)."

**Suggested Revision:**
> Leading journals by citation rate for articles published 1980-2019.

---

### Line 1586: Caption Clarity

**Original:**
> "Ratio of citations to Philosophical Studies to citations to other journals, for five year rolling windows."

**Issues:**
1. Missing hyphen: "five-year"
2. Slightly redundant "citations to... to citations to"

**Suggested Revision:**
> Ratio of citations to _Philosophical Studies_ versus other journals, five-year rolling windows.

**Alternative:**
> Citations to _Philosophical Studies_ relative to other journals, five-year rolling windows.

---

### Line 1630: Caption Clarity

**Original:**
> "Ratio of citations of normal issues of _Philosophical Studies_ citations to citations of other leading journals, five year rolling window."

**Issues:**
1. Missing hyphen: "five-year"
2. Redundant "citations" appears twice
3. Should be "windows" (plural) for consistency

**Suggested Revision:**
> Ratio of citations to normal issues of _Philosophical Studies_ versus other leading journals, five-year rolling window.

## Overall Section 3 Assessment

### Strengths:
- Clear presentation of citation data
- Good use of multiple tables and figures to illustrate trends
- Careful attention to comparing different measures (mean, median, percentiles)
- Acknowledges limitations and complexities in the data

### Areas for Improvement:
- Several instances of informal language ("get cited a lot," "rabbit hole," "let's turn")
- One major typo in section heading ("Citatations")
- Some awkward phrasings that could be more concise
- Minor formatting issues (double space)
- Some captions could be more parallel in structure

### Transition Issues:
- Good internal transitions between subsections
- The transition to the next section (Inbound Citations) could be more professional
- Consider whether "Inbound Citations" should be Section 4 rather than appearing to be part of Section 3

## Clean Revised Key Passages

### Opening Paragraph (Lines 1504-1505):
**Revised:**
> Articles in _Philosophical Studies_ are heavily cited. @tbl-all-cites shows the five journals with the most citations of articles published between 1980 and 2019 within the study's set of 100 journals.

> _Philosophical Studies_ is in first place on that list in part, but only in part, because it publishes so much. @tbl-all-articles lists the top five journals by the number of articles they have published.

### Comparative Analysis Paragraph (Line 1598):
**Revised:**
> The difference in @fig-compare-cites-rolling between the earlier and later years is striking. By this one measure, citations per article, _Philosophical Studies_ was performing adequately before 2003, but remained below the average of the top 20 journals. After 2003, it consistently exceeds the average journal in the top 20.

### Special Issues Discussion (Line 1624):
**Revised:**
> The numbers for BSPC are particularly striking. In the full set of articles I'm working from, i.e., all the indexed articles from 100 journals, only 1.1% of articles have 39 or more citations. But one quarter of the articles that _Philosophical Studies_ published from BSPC are in that 1.2%. Surprisingly, only one of the 25 most cited articles in _Philosophical Studies_ was from a BSPC special issue. The high average is not caused by outliers but by many BSPC articles receiving frequent citations. By contrast, four of the ten most cited articles were from the Oberlin colloquium. This is why the Q3 numbers for BSPC and Oberlin are so different, even though the means aren't that far apart.

### Transition to Next Section (Line 1660):
**Revised:**
> Setting aside this complexity, I turn now to the content of _Philosophical Studies_ over the years, starting with its inbound citations.

## Note on Section Structure

The section heading "Inbound Citations" appears at line 1662, which suggests it may be Section 4 rather than a subsection of Section 3. Consider clarifying the section numbering structure in your outline.
