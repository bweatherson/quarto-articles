# Section 6: Words and Trends - Copyediting Suggestions

## Line 1839: Typo - Word Duplication

**Original:**
> Four of the five topics retain a stable stable share of papers in _Philosophical Studies_ over time

**Issue:**
TYPO: "stable stable" - word repeated

**Suggested Revision:**
> Four of the five topics retain a stable share of papers in _Philosophical Studies_ over time

---

## Line 1959: Missing Word

**Original:**
> In the other direction, sometimes a word is less often than at other times, but more often than in peer journals.

**Issue:**
Missing word: "is **used** less often" or "appears less often"

**Suggested Revision:**
> In the other direction, sometimes a word is used less often than at other times, but more often than in peer journals.

**Alternative:**
> In the other direction, sometimes a word appears less frequently than at other times, but more frequently than in peer journals.

## Line 1959: Forward Reference

**Original:**
> One notable example of this is in @fig-intuitions, and I'll come back to that case in @sec-1990s-articles.

**Issue:**
Check that @sec-1990s-articles is the correct section reference (it appears to be a subsection below at line 2019)

**Suggested Revision:**
Verify the reference is correct. If referring to the subsection that follows:
> One notable example of this is in @fig-intuitions, and I'll return to that case below.

## Line 1980: Citation Format

**Original:**
> As Eugenio @Petrovich2024 notes,

**Issue:**
Check citation format consistency - should it be just "@Petrovich2024" or "Petrovich [-@Petrovich2024]"?

**Suggested Revision:**
> As @Petrovich2024 notes,

---

## Line 1993: Missing Article

**Original:**
> with special focus on questions moral realism, moral motivation,

**Issue:**
Missing article: "questions **about** moral realism" or "questions **of** moral realism"

**Suggested Revision:**
> with special focus on questions about moral realism, moral motivation,

---

## Line 2017: Forward Reference

**Original:**
> But as I'll go into more detail in @sec-1990s-articles,

**Issue:**
Grammar: "as I'll go into more detail" should be "as I'll discuss in more detail"

**Suggested Revision:**
> But as I'll discuss in more detail in @sec-1990s-articles,

**Alternative:**
> But as I detail more fully in @sec-1990s-articles,

## Line 2041: Extra Space and Comma Splice

**Original:**
> The _Philosophical Studies_ papers using these terms are not cited particularly often, and a high proportion of these cites are in _Philosophical Studies_ itself,  The rest of the field was moving on, but _Philosophical Studies_ was a step behind.

**Issues:**
1. Double space after comma
2. Comma splice (should be period or semicolon before "The rest")
3. "cites" should be "citations" (more formal)

**Suggested Revision:**
> The _Philosophical Studies_ papers using these terms are not cited particularly often, and a high proportion of these citations are in _Philosophical Studies_ itself. The rest of the field was moving on, but _Philosophical Studies_ was a step behind.

## Line 2006: Footnote Citation Format

**Original:**
> with a particular focus on the defence of abortion in @Thomson1971.^[One of the papers on abortion, [@WOSA1985ANT6600005; @WOSA1986AZA8100007], got printed twice

**Issues:**
1. British spelling "defence" vs American "defense"
2. Footnote citation format - should the citations be separated or formatted differently?

**Suggested Revision:**
> with a particular focus on the defense of abortion in @Thomson1971.^[One of the papers on abortion [@WOSA1985ANT6600005; @WOSA1986AZA8100007] got printed twice

## Line 2047: Citation List Formatting

**Original:**
> Before 2000, only one paper mentioned Irene Heim [@WOSA1988P180000006], only two mentioned Angelika Kratzer [@WOSA1986D182100003; @WOSA1984SK63200001], and only three mentioned James McCawley [@WOSA1985ABV7900005; @WOSA1988M482100005; @WOS000083809100001].

**Issue:**
This is correct but very dense - consider whether it would be clearer to move some citations to a footnote

**Suggested Revision (optional):**
> Before 2000, only one paper mentioned Irene Heim, only two mentioned Angelika Kratzer, and only three mentioned James McCawley.^[See respectively: @WOSA1988P180000006; @WOSA1986D182100003; @WOSA1984SK63200001; @WOSA1985ABV7900005; @WOSA1988M482100005; @WOS000083809100001.]

## Line 2047: Citation Format with Parenthetical

**Original:**
> The closest thing I see to interdisciplinary work are some applications of Montague grammar, e.g., by [@WOSA1984TJ24700012].

**Issue:**
Citation format: "by [@citation]" is awkward - should probably be "e.g., by Hazen [-@WOSA1984TJ24700012]" or restructure

**Suggested Revision:**
> The closest thing I see to interdisciplinary work are some applications of Montague grammar, e.g., @WOSA1984TJ24700012.

**Alternative:**
> The closest thing I see to interdisciplinary work are some applications of Montague grammar (e.g., @WOSA1984TJ24700012).

## Line 2049: Citation Format

**Original:**
> e.g., important papers by Christopher @WOSA1997XH01200003 and George @WOSA1996UE45200001.

**Issue:**
First names without surnames before citations - should provide surnames or restructure

**Suggested Revision:**
> e.g., important papers by @WOSA1997XH01200003 and @WOSA1996UE45200001.

**Alternative (if names are Hill and Bealer from earlier context):**
> e.g., important papers by Hill [-@WOSA1997XH01200003] and Bealer [-@WOSA1996UE45200001].

## Overall Section 6 Assessment

### Strengths:
- Clear explanation of word frequency methodology
- Good use of multiple examples to illustrate patterns
- Interesting observations about publishing trends
- Nice integration of figures to support claims
- Subsections on 1980s and 1990s provide good decade-by-decade analysis

### Critical Issues:
1. **Word duplication** (Line 1839): "stable stable" → "stable"
2. **Missing word** (Line 1959): needs "used" or similar verb
3. **Comma splice** (Line 2041): needs period instead of comma
4. **Missing preposition** (Line 1993): needs "about" or "of"

### Other Issues:
- Several forward references that may need verification
- Some citation formatting inconsistencies
- British spelling "defence" should be "defense" for consistency
- Grammar issue: "as I'll go into more detail"
- "cites" should be "citations" (more formal)
- Double space in line 2041

### Structure Note:
This section contains subsections about the 1980s (line 1991) and 1990s (line 2019). These could potentially be separate sections (7 and 8) rather than subsections of 6, but the current structure works if the "Words and Trends" section is meant to be comprehensive across decades.

## Clean Revised Key Passages

### Opening (Line 1839):
**Revised:**
> Four of the five topics retain a stable share of papers in _Philosophical Studies_ over time, while philosophy of language falls away dramatically. @fig-language isolates the language panel from @fig-five-topics, and adds a trendline, to make this more visible.

### Word Trends Guidance (Line 1959):
**Revised:**
> In the other direction, sometimes a word is used less often than at other times, but more often than in peer journals. When this happens, it can be a sign that _Philosophical Studies_ is publishing articles in topics that other journals have not yet picked up. One notable example of this is in @fig-intuitions, and I'll return to that case below.

### 1980s Ethics (Line 1993):
**Revised:**
> From the 1990s to at least the mid 2010s, the bulk of ethics papers in _Philosophical Studies_ were on fairly theoretical questions, with special focus on questions about moral realism, moral motivation, and (a topic I'll return to) moral responsibility. But in the 1980s the ethics papers in the journal had a different focus.

### Citation Discussion (Line 2041):
**Revised:**
> Looking back, a lot of this discussion of content feels stale by the mid-1990s. There is a sense that the important things to say have been said. This shows up in the citation data. The _Philosophical Studies_ papers using these terms are not cited particularly often, and a high proportion of these citations are in _Philosophical Studies_ itself. The rest of the field was moving on, but _Philosophical Studies_ was a step behind.

### Linguistics Engagement (Line 2017):
**Revised:**
> But as I discuss in more detail in @sec-1990s-articles, the kind of philosophy of language it was publishing was very different from the work that would become central to the field in later decades. In the 1980s, the central focus in _Philosophical Studies_ was Donnellan's distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions, and the words 'Donnellan', 'referential' and 'attributive' all appear frequently. But there isn't much engagement with linguistics, or more broadly with work on compositional semantics.

## Summary of Required Corrections

**CRITICAL:**
1. Line 1839: Remove duplicate "stable"
2. Line 1959: Add missing verb ("used" or "appears")
3. Line 2041: Change comma to period (fix comma splice) and remove double space
4. Line 1993: Add missing preposition ("about" or "of")

**Important:**
1. Line 2017: "as I'll go into more detail" → "as I discuss in more detail"
2. Line 2041: "cites" → "citations"
3. Line 2006: "defence" → "defense" (American spelling)

**Recommended:**
1. Verify all forward references to @sec-1990s-articles
2. Review citation formatting for consistency
3. Consider simplifying dense citation lists
