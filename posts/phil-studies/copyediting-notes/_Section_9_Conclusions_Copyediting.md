# Section 9: Conclusions and Further Questions - Copyediting Suggestions

## Overall Assessment
This concluding section effectively synthesizes the paper's findings and points toward future research. The main areas for improvement are: clarifying some pronoun references, tightening a few wordy sentences, and improving transitions. The section is well-structured with three distinct themes: the journal's changing status, its generalist credentials, and future research questions.

## Line-by-Line Issues

### Line 2461: Grammar Error
**Original:** "...it is publishing papers that set the research agenda others to which other journals respond."

**Issue:** The phrase "others to which" is garbled.

**Suggested fix:** "...it is publishing papers that set the research agenda to which other journals respond."

---

### Line 2463: Clarity Issue
**Original:** "When _Noûs_ underwent a similar change a decade or two before _Philosophical Studies_, this was not a sign of the hierarchy flattening; _Noûs_ just got more prestigious."

**Issue:** The timeframe "a decade or two before" is vague. Since you mention 1980 as the starting point, readers might wonder: before 1980? Or a decade or two before the 2000s when PS changed?

**Suggested clarification:** Consider specifying "in the 1960s-1970s" or "before the period studied here" if that's accurate.

---

### Line 2465: Punctuation Error
**Original:** "If so, what are they, and how would we tell?^[If there are any..."

**Issue:** Missing period before the footnote marker (or the question mark serves, but the footnote placement is awkward).

**Suggested fix:** Move footnote after the period, or integrate it more smoothly. Also: "are there _any_ generalist journals in philosophy" should end with a question mark.

**Current:** "are there _any_ generalist journals in philosophy."
**Corrected:** "are there _any_ generalist journals in philosophy?"

---

### Line 2469: Wordiness
**Original:** "Will epistemology and ethics continue to move closer together?"

**Issue:** Not wrong, but could be more precise given your earlier discussion.

**Optional enhancement:** "Will the convergence of epistemology and ethics around questions of reasons continue?"

---

### Line 2469: Repetitive Structure
**Issue:** This paragraph asks six questions in a row, all starting with "Will..." The structure becomes somewhat repetitive.

**Suggested fix:** Consider varying the sentence structure. For example:
- Start one with "Can we expect..."
- Start another with "Is it likely that..."
- Or break into two sentences: "Several specific questions emerge. Will metaphysics continue..."

---

### Line 2471: Word Choice
**Original:** "backs up this intuition"

**Issue:** "Backs up" is slightly informal for an academic paper.

**Suggested alternatives:** "supports this intuition" or "confirms this intuition"

---

## Section-Level Issues

### 1. Transition from Section 8
**Issue:** The transition from the detailed 2010s discussion to the broad conclusions could be smoother.

**Suggested addition:** Consider adding a brief transitional sentence at the start of the Conclusions section:
"Having traced _Philosophical Studies_ through four decades of change, I want to step back and consider what these patterns reveal about both the journal and the discipline."

### 2. Paragraph Flow
The three main themes (status change, generalist question, future questions) are well-organized, but the middle paragraph about "generalist" status feels somewhat disconnected from the frame about the journal's rising status.

**Suggested reordering or bridging:** Consider adding a transitional phrase like:
"Related to questions about the journal's status is the question of its scope."

### 3. Conclusion Strength
**Issue:** The final paragraph presents "two contradictory answers" but doesn't take a position or offer a synthesis. While appropriate caution is good, readers might appreciate a bit more guidance.

**Suggested enhancement:** Consider adding one more sentence that acknowledges this tension:
"The history of _Philosophical Studies_ suggests both stability and change: deep continuity in citation patterns and editorial approach, combined with dramatic shifts in topical focus. Whether the current trends represent a temporary swing or a permanent transformation remains to be seen, but the journal's past success in adapting to disciplinary changes suggests it will continue to evolve with the field."

## Suggested Rewrite of Key Passages

### Paragraph 1 (Lines 2461-2461)
**Original:**
"One theme of this essay has been the change in the status of _Philosophical Studies_. In 1980, it primarily published papers that responded to ideas introduced in books or higher prestige journals some time earlier, often several years earlier. A few decades later, it is publishing papers that set the research agenda others to which other journals respond."

**Revised:**
"One theme of this essay has been the change in _Philosophical Studies_' status within the discipline. In 1980, it primarily published papers responding to ideas introduced in books or higher prestige journals years earlier. A few decades later, it publishes papers that set the research agenda to which other journals respond."

**Changes:**
- Fixed grammar error ("others to which" → "to which")
- Tightened language ("some time earlier, often several years earlier" → "years earlier")
- Changed "the status of" to cleaner possessive

### Questions Paragraph (Line 2469)
**Original:**
"We can make some of these questions more precise. Will metaphysics continue to be post-modal, or will we see a revival of modal metaphysics? Will philosophy of mind continue its trend of becoming more empirical, or will there be a return to armchair approaches? Will epistemology and ethics continue to move closer together? Will philosophy of language keep moving closer to linguistics? And, most of all, will the social turn across so many different parts of philosophy continue? If it does, will it turn more towards questions about society as a whole, or will it continue to be based in interpersonal, or second-personal, phenomena?"

**Revised:**
"We can make some of these questions more precise. Will metaphysics continue to be post-modal, or will modal metaphysics revive? Will philosophy of mind continue becoming more empirical, or will there be a return to armchair approaches? Will epistemology and ethics continue converging around questions of reasons? Will philosophy of language keep moving closer to linguistics? And, most importantly, will the social turn across so many parts of philosophy continue? If so, will it shift toward questions about society as a whole, or remain focused on interpersonal, or second-personal, phenomena?"

**Changes:**
- Varied verb constructions slightly
- "most of all" → "most importantly" (more formal)
- "If it does" → "If so" (tighter)
- Eliminated some wordiness ("continue its trend of becoming" → "continue becoming")

### Final Paragraph Enhancement
**Original ending:**
"On the one hand, the trends, especially since 2014, seem so dramatic it's hard to imagine them suddenly reversing. (And the preliminary data we have from the early 2020s backs up this intuition.) On the other hand, previous trends have ended rather abruptly, without much obvious warning, and perhaps these trends will as well."

**Suggested addition after this:**
"What we can say with confidence is that _Philosophical Studies_ has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to the evolving interests of the discipline while maintaining continuity in its editorial standards and citation networks. Whether the journal's future trajectory continues along its current path or takes another unexpected turn, this study of its past four decades provides a detailed picture of how one journal both reflected and shaped the development of analytic philosophy."

## Summary of Recommendations

### High Priority (Errors/Clarity):
1. **Line 2461:** Fix "others to which" → "to which"
2. **Line 2465:** Fix missing question mark
3. **Line 2471:** Change "backs up" → "supports"

### Medium Priority (Style/Flow):
4. Add transitional sentence at section opening
5. Add bridge between status discussion and generalist discussion
6. Vary sentence structure in questions paragraph
7. Consider enhancing final paragraph with synthesis

### Low Priority (Polish):
8. Clarify timeframe for _Noûs_ comparison
9. Consider slight rewording of some questions for variety

## Caption/Table Review
No tables or figures appear in this section, so no caption review needed.

---

## Transition Assessment

### Transition INTO Section 9 (from Section 8):
**Current:** Abrupt shift from detailed 2010s discussion to broad conclusions.
**Recommendation:** Add opening transitional sentence (suggested above).

### Internal Transitions:
- Status theme → Generalist theme: Could use a bridge sentence
- Generalist theme → Future questions: Works reasonably well with "But the biggest open questions..."

### Transition OUT (Paper Ending):
**Current:** Ends on note of uncertainty about future trends
**Recommendation:** Consider adding a synthesizing sentence that acknowledges both the journal's adaptability and the value of the study itself (suggested revision above)

---

## Overall Section Effectiveness
The conclusion effectively: 
- Synthesizes the main finding about the journal's rising status
- Raises interesting meta-questions about generalism
- Points toward future research directions
- Acknowledges uncertainty appropriately

Main improvement area: Could be slightly stronger in synthesis/takeaway, though the current ending's modesty is also a reasonable choice for an empirical historical study.
