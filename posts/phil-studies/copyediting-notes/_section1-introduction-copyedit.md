## Line 1139: Opening Sentence Issues

**Original:**
> _Philosophical Studies_ is the most cited journal in philosophy journals, so it is worthy of study both in its own right, and as a mirror of broader trends in philosophy.

**Issues:**
1. Awkward phrasing: "in philosophy journals" is redundant/unclear
2. Should clarify the scope (what citation data?)

**Suggested Revision:**
> _Philosophical Studies_ is the most cited journal in English-language philosophy, making it worthy of study both in its own right and as a mirror of broader trends in the discipline.

**Alternative:**
> Among philosophy journals, _Philosophical Studies_ has the highest citation count, making it worthy of study both in its own right and as a mirror of broader trends in philosophy.

---

## Line 1141: Clarity and Flow

**Original:**
> In the first half of the paper, I look at the growth the citation rate (i.e., number of citations per article) in _Philosophical Studies_.

**Issues:**
1. Missing word: "growth **of** the citation rate" 
2. Slightly abrupt transition

**Suggested Revision:**
> In the first half of the paper, I examine the growth of _Philosophical Studies_' citation rate (i.e., the number of citations per article).

## Line 1141-1142: Run-on Sentence

**Original:**
> If we take its peers to be the twenty philosophy journals with the highest citation rates over the last forty years, it has gone from having a citation rate 10-20 percent below the average, to a rate 10-20 percent above the average.

**Issues:**
1. Very long sentence with multiple clauses
2. "If we take" is somewhat informal for academic writing

**Suggested Revision:**
> Compared with the twenty philosophy journals that had the highest citation rates over the last forty years, _Philosophical Studies_ has gone from a citation rate 10-20 percent below average to one 10-20 percent above average.

**Alternative (breaking into two sentences):**
> I compare _Philosophical Studies_ with the twenty philosophy journals that had the highest citation rates over the last forty years. Relative to this peer group, _Philosophical Studies_ has gone from a citation rate 10-20 percent below average to one 10-20 percent above average.

## Line 1142: Awkward Phrasing

**Original:**
> And it's done this despite increasing its publication volume, which one would normally expect to decrease citation rate.

**Issues:**
1. Starting sentence with "And" (stylistic preference)
2. Pronoun "it's" could be clearer
3. Missing article: "decrease **the** citation rate"

**Suggested Revision:**
> The journal has achieved this growth despite increasing its publication volume—a change that typically decreases citation rates.

---

## Line 1142: Unclear Antecedent

**Original:**
> This is explained in part by the move to publishing more special issues, with the special issues from the Bellingham Summer Philosophy Conference being particularly important, and in part by the topic mix in _Philosophical Studies_ changing in ways that tracked changes in the broader philosophical community.

**Issues:**
1. Very long sentence with two "in part" clauses
2. Repetition of "special issues"
3. "This is explained" - unclear what "this" refers to exactly
4. "tracked changes" is awkward

**Suggested Revision (breaking into two sentences):**
> This growth stems partly from the journal's increased publication of special issues, with those from the Bellingham Summer Philosophy Conference being particularly important. It also reflects changes in _Philosophical Studies_' topic mix that paralleled broader shifts in the philosophical community.

## Line 1143: Figure Reference

**Original:**
> The short version of those changes is shown in @fig-five-topics.

**Issues:**
1. "The short version" is informal
2. Could be more descriptive

**Suggested Revision:**
> These topical shifts are summarized in @fig-five-topics.

**Alternative:**
> @fig-five-topics illustrates these changes in the journal's topical focus.

---

## Line 1147: Figure Caption

**Original:**
> Proportion of _Philosophical Studies_ articles that are in different topics, 1980-2019.

**Issues:**
1. Slightly awkward phrasing
2. Could specify what the topics are

**Suggested Revision:**
> Proportion of _Philosophical Studies_ articles in five main philosophical topics, 1980-2019.

**Alternative:**
> Distribution of _Philosophical Studies_ articles across five philosophical topics, 1980-2019.

---

## Line 1163: Unclear Pronoun

**Original:**
> In the late twentieth century, _Philosophical Studies_ was focussed on philosophy of language, and in particular on core analytic questions about reference and description. These were central to philosophy in the 1970s after _Naming and Necessity_, and stayed central to graduate education at top schools well into the twenty-first century.

**Issues:**
1. "These" is ambiguous (the questions? the topics? the journal's focus?)
2. British spelling "focussed" vs American "focused" (be consistent)
3. Transition could be smoother

**Suggested Revision:**
> In the late twentieth century, _Philosophical Studies_ focused on philosophy of language, particularly core analytic questions about reference and description. These questions became central to philosophy in the 1970s following the publication of _Naming and Necessity_ and remained central to graduate education at top schools well into the twenty-first century.

## Line 1163-1164: Sentence Connection

**Original:**
> But the focus of other journals moved away from these questions earlier than _Philosophical Studies_ did.

**Issues:**
1. "But" creates slight tension with the previous claim about graduate education
2. Could be more specific about the timing

**Suggested Revision:**
> The focus of other leading journals, however, moved away from these questions earlier than _Philosophical Studies_ did.

**Alternative:**
> Other leading journals shifted away from these questions in the 1990s and early 2000s, while _Philosophical Studies_ maintained its focus longer.

---

## Line 1165-1166: Final Paragraph Issues

**Original:**
> After the turn of the century, the journal moved into two topics that did not hurt its citation rates. First, it was part of the enormous discussion on epistemology, and in particular on contextualism in epistemology, in the 2000s. Second, in the 2010s, it, along with much of the rest of the discipline, moved more strongly into social philosophy.

**Issues:**
1. "did not hurt its citation rates" is awkward/double-negative
2. Repetition of "epistemology" 
3. "it, along with much of" creates awkward comma placement
4. Could strengthen the transition to next section

**Suggested Revision:**
> After the turn of the century, the journal moved into two topics that enhanced its impact. First, it participated actively in the 2000s' extensive discussions of epistemology, particularly contextualism. Second, in the 2010s, it joined much of the rest of the discipline in moving more strongly into social philosophy.

## Overall Section Assessment

### Strengths:
- Clear overview of the paper's structure
- Good use of figure to illustrate main point
- Establishes the journal's importance effectively

### Areas for Improvement:
- Several run-on sentences that could be broken up
- Some unclear pronoun references
- A few instances of informal language
- Could improve transitions between paragraphs

### Suggested Additional Transition
Consider adding a brief transition sentence at the end of the Introduction to lead into Section 2 (Overview):

**Suggested Addition:**
> The following section provides essential background on the journal's editorial history and publication patterns before turning to the citation analysis.

## Clean Revised Version of Introduction

_Philosophical Studies_ is the most cited journal in English-language philosophy, making it worthy of study both in its own right and as a mirror of broader trends in the discipline. This paper uses a variety of tools from data analysis to examine the nature of _Philosophical Studies_ and how it has changed over time, from 1980 to 2019.

In the first half of the paper, I examine the growth of _Philosophical Studies_' citation rate (i.e., the number of citations per article). Compared with the twenty philosophy journals that had the highest citation rates over the last forty years, _Philosophical Studies_ has gone from a citation rate 10-20 percent below average to one 10-20 percent above average. The journal has achieved this growth despite increasing its publication volume—a change that typically decreases citation rates. This growth stems partly from the journal's increased publication of special issues, with those from the Bellingham Summer Philosophy Conference being particularly important. It also reflects changes in _Philosophical Studies_' topic mix that paralleled broader shifts in the philosophical community.

This leads to the second half of the paper, which examines how the journal's topic mix changed over the years. @fig-five-topics illustrates these changes in topical focus.

[Figure]

In the late twentieth century, _Philosophical Studies_ focused on philosophy of language, particularly core analytic questions about reference and description. These questions became central to philosophy in the 1970s following the publication of _Naming and Necessity_ and remained central to graduate education at top schools well into the twenty-first century. Other leading journals, however, shifted away from these questions earlier than _Philosophical Studies_ did.

After the turn of the century, the journal moved into two topics that enhanced its impact. First, it participated actively in the 2000s' extensive discussions of epistemology, particularly contextualism. Second, in the 2010s, it joined much of the rest of the discipline in moving more strongly into social philosophy.
