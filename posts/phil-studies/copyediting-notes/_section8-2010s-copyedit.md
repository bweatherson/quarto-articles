# Section 8: 2010s - Copyediting Suggestions

## Line 2085: Subject-Verb Agreement (CRITICAL - already noted in Section 7)

**Original:**
> The change in citation practices in the 2010s mean that we can use citation data

**Issue:**
Subject-verb agreement: "change... **means**" (singular subject needs singular verb)

**Suggested Revision:**
> The change in citation practices in the 2010s means that we can use citation data

---

## Line 2189: Missing Word

**Original:**
> I've already mentioned that get longer, and make more references to "Oxford" over this decade.

**Issue:**
Missing subject: "that **articles** get longer" or "that **papers** get longer"

**Suggested Revision:**
> I've already mentioned that articles get longer, and make more references to "Oxford" over this decade.

---

## Line 2212: Italics for Emphasis

**Original:**
> The graph isn't just going up, it is _accelerating_.

**Issue:**
Check if italics for emphasis is consistent with your style throughout the paper

**Suggested Revision:**
Keep as is if this is your style, or:
> The graph isn't just going up, it is accelerating.

---

## Line 2222: Typo

**Original:**
> The language of analytic philosohy changed a fair bit over the 2000s

**Issue:**
TYPO: "philosohy" should be "philosophy"

**Suggested Revision:**
> The language of analytic philosophy changed a fair bit over the 2000s

---

## Line 2226: Typo

**Original:**
> Rather than going through twenty graps, I'll just do a table

**Issue:**
TYPO: "graps" should be "graphs"

**Suggested Revision:**
> Rather than going through twenty graphs, I'll just do a table

---

## Line 2313: Typo

**Original:**
> And it is striking how much larger the change is in _Philosophical Studies_ than it its peer journals.

**Issue:**
TYPO: "it its" should be "in its"

**Suggested Revision:**
> And it is striking how much larger the change is in _Philosophical Studies_ than in its peer journals.

---

## Line 2315: Word Duplication

**Original:**
> _Philosophical Studies_ was a big part part of this shift.

**Issue:**
TYPO: "part part" - word duplicated

**Suggested Revision:**
> _Philosophical Studies_ was a big part of this shift.

---

## Line 2336: Placeholder Text

**Original:**
> @fig-social might be misleading unless you know how philosophers use 'social'.^[I'm indebted here to NAME RETRRACTED.]

**Issue:**
Placeholder text "NAME RETRRACTED" needs to be replaced or removed

**Suggested Revision:**
> @fig-social might be misleading unless you know how philosophers use 'social'.

**Alternative (if you want to keep the acknowledgment):**
> @fig-social might be misleading unless you know how philosophers use 'social'.^[I'm grateful to [NAME] for this observation.]

## Table Caption Labels: Lines 2342 and 2380

**Original (Line 2342):**
> #| fig-cap: "Uses of terms for groups."

**Original (Line 2380):**
> #| fig-cap: "Uses of terms associated with interpersonal ethics."

**Issue:**
These are tables, not figures, so should use "tbl-cap" not "fig-cap"

**Suggested Revision:**
Change `fig-cap` to `tbl-cap` for both

---

## Line 2461: Awkward Phrasing

**Original:**
> A few decades later, it is publishing papers that set the research agenda others to which other journals respond.

**Issue:**
Awkward construction: "agenda others to which" should be restructured

**Suggested Revision:**
> A few decades later, it is publishing papers that set the research agenda to which other journals respond.

**Alternative:**
> A few decades later, it publishes papers that set the research agenda for other journals.

- Excellent use of quantitative data (tables, graphs, citation analysis)
- Good integration of the "social turn" as the major theme
- Effective use of specific examples
- Nice transition into conclusions section

### Critical Issues (Must Fix):
1. **Line 2085**: "mean" → "means" (subject-verb agreement)
2. **Line 2189**: Missing subject before "get longer"
3. **Line 2222**: "philosohy" → "philosophy" (typo)
4. **Line 2226**: "graps" → "graphs" (typo)
5. **Line 2313**: "it its" → "in its" (typo)
6. **Line 2315**: "part part" → "part" (word duplication)
7. **Line 2336**: "NAME RETRRACTED" placeholder needs removal
8. **Lines 2342, 2380**: "fig-cap" → "tbl-cap" (wrong label type)
9. **Line 2461**: Awkward sentence structure needs fixing

### Style Observations:
- This is the longest section with substantial data presentation
- Good balance between quantitative evidence and narrative
- Effective use of tables to present dense information
- The "social turn" theme is well-developed and supported

### Transition:
- Excellent transition from 2000s to 2010s
- Clear setup for the conclusions section
- The section effectively synthesizes multiple trends

## Clean Revised Key Passages

### Opening (Line 2085):
**Revised:**
> The change in citation practices in the 2010s means that we can use citation data alongside word data to see what happened. So many of the citations in the journal's history through 2019 are in the 2010s that the inbound citation numbers for the decade look a bit like the overall citation numbers we discussed earlier, especially in @tbl-mainly-in-ps and @tbl-mainly-out-ps. In @fig-2010-citations I've graphed the number of citations some prominent articles had in _Philosophical Studies_ and elsewhere, with notable outliers labeled.^[Note I've only included articles with 40 or more citations in the 2010s; otherwise the graph just gets overloaded at the bottom-left corner.]

### Article Length Discussion (Line 2189):
**Revised:**
> I've already mentioned that articles get longer, and make more references to "Oxford" over this decade. @fig-citations-by-year shows how many more citations there are to articles in philosophy journals.

> The graph isn't just going up, it is accelerating. The data I have from the 2020s suggests this trend does not stop.

### Analytic Philosophy Discussion (Line 2222):
**Revised:**
> We have to be a little careful here, because there are some purely verbal trends that could be coming into play. The language of analytic philosophy changed a fair bit over the 2000s and especially 2010s. There are fewer 'theories' and more 'accounts'. There are fewer 'criticisms' and more 'challenges'. I think the reduction in how often 'logic' and 'analysis' are used reflects a move away from a certain style of doing philosophy; but it's hard to conclusively rule out that it's not another verbal trend.

### Names Table Introduction (Line 2226):
**Revised:**
> There is a dramatic change in the 2010s in which philosophers are frequently named in _Philosophical Studies_. Rather than going through twenty graphs, I'll just do a table comparing word usage for prominent names before and after 2010. I'll mostly stick to names which, in _Philosophical Studies_ at least, almost exclusively pick out one philosopher. That said, I've included "Schroeder" because both Mark and Tim are important to the story of the decade. It would take up a lot of space to show all these graphs, and also the graphs are incredibly noisy. In @tbl-names-early-late, the rates shown are how often the word on the left appears per 100,000 words. I've shown this for (a) _Philosophical Studies_ 1980-2009, (b) _Philosophical Studies_ from 2010-2019, (c) the twenty journals I'm comparing _Philosophical Studies_ to in 1980-2009, and (d) those twenty journals from 2010-2019.

> This seems like a set of fairly dramatic changes, in both directions. And it is striking how much larger the change is in _Philosophical Studies_ than in its peer journals.

### Grounding Discussion (Line 2315):
**Revised:**
> The biggest story in metaphysics this decade was the end of what @Sider2020 calls the 'modal era' in metaphysics. From the late 1960s to the late 2000s, the most active discussions in metaphysics were about ontology and modality. The most notable book of this period, _On the Plurality of Worlds_ [@Lewis1986a] was about both. From 2010 onwards, the focus shifted to discussions of fundamentality, priority, and, most of all, grounding. As @fig-grounding (above) shows, _Philosophical Studies_ was a big part of this shift.

### Social Philosophy Note (Line 2336):
**Revised:**
> @fig-social might be misleading unless you know how philosophers use 'social'. Almost anything involving multiple people will be classed as social. There isn't a distinction here between interpersonal, or what @Darwall2006 calls second-personal, phenomena, and phenomena that only emerge at the level of large societies. So the increased discussion of reactive attitudes, especially blame, is part of this social turn. I'm not sure this is optimal; society-level phenomena are rather different from phenomena that arise in groups of two or three. But that's how the terminology has developed, and I'll follow common practice here.

## Summary of Required Corrections

**CRITICAL (Must Fix):**
1. Line 2085: "mean" → "means"
2. Line 2189: Add subject "articles" or "papers"
3. Line 2222: "philosohy" → "philosophy"
4. Line 2226: "graps" → "graphs"
5. Line 2313: "it its" → "in its"
6. Line 2315: Remove duplicate "part"
7. Line 2336: Remove or replace "NAME RETRRACTED"
8. Lines 2342, 2380: Change "fig-cap" to "tbl-cap"
9. Line 2461: Fix awkward sentence structure

**Style Considerations:**
1. Line 2212: Consider whether to keep italics for emphasis
2. Consider whether all tables need the same level of caption detail

## Note on Section Length and Complexity

This is the longest and most data-intensive section of the paper. It effectively brings together multiple strands of analysis:
- Citation patterns
- Word usage trends
- Changes in which philosophers are cited
- The social turn in philosophy
- Shifts in metaphysics (grounding)
- Convergence of ethics and epistemology

The section successfully synthesizes these different elements into a coherent narrative about the 2010s.
