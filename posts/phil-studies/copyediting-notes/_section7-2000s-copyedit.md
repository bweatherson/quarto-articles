# Section 7: 2000s - Copyediting Suggestions

## Line 2055: Agreement Issue

**Original:**
> Indeed, another theme of those early years are long disputes about just what idealism, realism, pragmaticism, and positivism, really are.

**Issue:**
Subject-verb agreement: "theme... **is**" (singular subject needs singular verb)

**Suggested Revision:**
> Indeed, another theme of those early years is long disputes about just what idealism, realism, pragmaticism, and positivism really are.

**Note:** Also removed comma before "really" (not needed)

## Line 2069: British Spelling

**Original:**
> where papers like "Contextualism and Warranted Assertibility Manoeuvres"

**Issue:**
British spelling "Manoeuvres" - this is part of a title, so it should remain as is

**Note:** Keep as is since it's a proper title

## Line 2071: Grammar Issue

**Original:**
> The center of that were debates about contextualism.

**Issue:**
Subject-verb agreement: "center... **was**" (singular subject needs singular verb)

**Suggested Revision:**
> The center of that was debates about contextualism.

**Alternative (better phrasing):**
> Central to this trend were debates about contextualism.

## Line 2085: Agreement Issue

**Original:**
> The change in citation practices in the 2010s mean that we can use citation data

**Issue:**
Subject-verb agreement: "change... **means**" (singular subject needs singular verb)

**Suggested Revision:**
> The change in citation practices in the 2010s means that we can use citation data

**Alternative:**
> Changes in citation practices in the 2010s mean that we can use citation data

- Effective connection between word usage and broader trends
- Nice contextualization within broader disciplinary changes
- Good integration with Petrovich's work for external validation

### Critical Issues:
1. **Three subject-verb agreement errors** (lines 2055, 2071, 2085)

### Style Observations:
- The section effectively uses the "isms" theme as an organizing principle
- Good balance between specific examples and broader claims
- Clear connection between this decade and previous/subsequent trends
- Appropriately cites specific highly-cited papers

## Clean Revised Key Passages

### Opening Paragraph (Line 2055):
**Revised:**
> Philosophers have long been fond of named ideologies, and labels for proponents of these ideologies. The earliest years of philosophy journals are full of disputes between idealists, realists, pragmatists, and positivists. These labels can obscure as much as they reveal. Indeed, another theme of those early years is long disputes about just what idealism, realism, pragmaticism, and positivism really are.

### Epistemology Discussion (Line 2071):
**Revised:**
> This leads to the big story of the 2000s, the rise of epistemology. According to the topic model, epistemology went from being 15% of the journal over the previous two decades, to being 20% in the 2000s, and then rising again in the 2010s. In the 2000s, this was mostly because of discussions about knowledge. (In the 2010s, the focus would shift more to justification.) Central to this trend were debates about contextualism. "Elusive Knowledge" [@WOSA1996VY21200001] was cited in 3.3% of all articles that decade, and "Solving the Sceptical Problem" in 2.9% of all articles. That's a higher rate than any other article was cited over a decade. The next highest rate is that "The Skeptic and the Dogmatist" [@WOS000165361800002] is cited in 2.8% of articles in the 2010s, as the focus moved over to justification.

### Comparative Context (Line 2081):
**Revised:**
> _Philosophical Studies_ isn't the only journal that sees a shift to epistemology at this time. @Petrovich2024 looked at citation data from _Mind_, _Noûs_, _Philosophical Review_, _Journal of Philosophy_ and _Philosophy and Phenomenological Research_, and concluded that there was a marked uptick in epistemology articles being written, and cited, in the 2000s. His study wasn't restricted to citations of journal articles, like this study is. That's relevant not because there are so many epistemology books that get cited in that time, but rather because his study lets us see when books like _Word and Object_ and _Naming and Necessity_ start getting cited less, and articles like "Elusive Knowledge" start getting cited more. As with _Philosophical Studies_, that seems to happen in the 2000s.

## Summary of Required Corrections

**CRITICAL:**
1. Line 2055: "are" → "is" (subject-verb agreement)
2. Line 2071: "were" → "was" (subject-verb agreement) OR rephrase
3. Line 2085: "mean" → "means" (subject-verb agreement)

**Minor:**
1. Line 2055: Remove comma before "really" for smoother reading

## Additional Notes

This is a relatively clean section with good content. The main issues are three subject-verb agreement errors that need correction. The section effectively:

1. Establishes a thematic framework (the rise of "-isms")
2. Provides specific evidence through word usage patterns
3. Connects to broader disciplinary trends
4. Validates findings with external research (Petrovich)
5. Sets up the transition to the 2010s

The writing is clear and the argument is well-supported. Once the grammar errors are corrected, this section will be quite strong.
