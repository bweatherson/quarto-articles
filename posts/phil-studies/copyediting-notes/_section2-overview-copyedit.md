# Section 2: Overview - Copyediting Suggestions

## Section 2.1: Editorial History

### Line 1177: Spelling Error

**Original:**
> In 2010, Cohen moved to the University of Arizona, and so the journal was edited out of Tuscon for a second time.

**Issue:**
Spelling error: "Tuscon" should be "Tucson"

**Suggested Revision:**
> In 2010, Cohen moved to the University of Arizona, and so the journal was edited out of Tucson for a second time.

---

### Line 1175: British vs American Spelling

**Original:**
> While the journal was at Arizona, each year a grad student assistant was recognised on the title page as an editorial assistant.

**Issue:**
British spelling "recognised" vs American "recognized" - needs consistency throughout

**Suggested Revision:**
> While the journal was at Arizona, each year a grad student assistant was recognized on the title page as an editorial assistant.

---

### Line 1179: Awkward Sentence Opening

**Original:**
> There are three things about this editorial history that will become important in what follows.

**Issue:**
Slightly informal phrasing ("three things")

**Suggested Revision:**
> Three aspects of this editorial history merit attention.

**Alternative:**
> Three features of this editorial history will prove important in what follows.

---

### Line 1179: Parallel Structure

**Original:**
> One is that the names here include several of the most important epistemologists of the last half century. A second is that the journal has had a very stable editorial history; a summary like this for most other leading journals would take twice as long to write. And the third is that the biggest single change, the transition from John Pollock to Stewart Cohen as Editor in 1992, does not seem to have had an immediate impact on the journal.

**Issue:**
1. "One is that" / "A second is that" / "And the third is that" - inconsistent structure
2. Starting sentence with "And"
3. Very long third sentence

**Suggested Revision:**
> First, the names here include several of the most important epistemologists of the last half century. Second, the journal has had remarkably stable editorial leadership; a comparable summary for most other leading journals would take twice as long to write. Third, the biggest single change—the transition from John Pollock to Stewart Cohen as Editor in 1992—does not appear to have had an immediate impact on the journal.

## Section 2.2: Articles

### Line 1183: Figure Reference Clarity

**Original:**
> @fig-article-count-by-year shows how many articles _Philosophical Studies_ has published each year; @fig-word-count-by-year shows the total word count for the journal each year; @fig-word-max-by-year shows the count of the longest article each year; and @fig-word-quartiles shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile article by word count for each year.

**Issues:**
1. Very long sentence with multiple clauses
2. "shows the count of the longest article" is awkward
3. Could be broken up for clarity

**Suggested Revision:**
> Four figures illustrate these publication trends. @fig-article-count-by-year shows how many articles _Philosophical Studies_ has published each year. @fig-word-count-by-year shows the total word count for the journal each year. @fig-word-max-by-year shows the length of the longest article each year. @fig-word-quartiles shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile article lengths for each year.

---

### Line 1249: Informal Language

**Original:**
> It used to be common for philosophy colloquia to include papers that were read out by the author. This was a bad practice, and it's been mostly gone for several years.

**Issues:**
1. "read out" is slightly informal
2. "mostly gone" is informal
3. "This was a bad practice" is a value judgment that might be softened

**Suggested Revision:**
> It used to be common for philosophy colloquia to include papers that were read aloud by the author. This practice has largely disappeared in recent years.

**Alternative (if you want to keep the evaluation):**
> It used to be common for philosophy colloquia to include papers that were read aloud by the author—a practice that has largely disappeared in recent years.

---

### Line 1249-1250: Unclear Pronoun

**Original:**
> But starting in the mid-2010s it became an impractical practice. No one was writing papers that even could be read out in the length of a typical colloquium slot.

**Issues:**
1. "it became" - unclear what "it" refers to (reading papers aloud)
2. "could be read out" - slightly informal
3. "in the length of" should be "within"

**Suggested Revision:**
> By the mid-2010s, however, reading papers aloud had become impractical. Authors were no longer writing papers that could be presented orally within a typical colloquium time slot.

---

### Line 1251: Forward Reference Clarity

**Original:**
> Everything I've said so far is about _articles_ in _Philosophical Studies_. As I'll go over in @sec-what-is-an-article, this is a less clear category than we might like, in part because of the variety of kinds of issues _Philosophical Studies_ puts out.

**Issues:**
1. "Everything I've said so far" is informal
2. "less clear category than we might like" is imprecise
3. "kinds of issues" is slightly awkward

**Suggested Revision:**
> The preceding discussion concerns _articles_ in _Philosophical Studies_. As @sec-what-is-an-article explains, this is a less straightforward category than it might appear, partly because of the variety of issue types _Philosophical Studies_ publishes.

---

## Section 2.3: Special Issues

### Line 1257: Typo

**Original:**
> 1. The APA Pacific Divsion

**Issue:**
Typo: "Divsion" should be "Division"

**Suggested Revision:**
> 1. The APA Pacific Division

---

### Line 1263: Grammar Error

**Original:**
> I'm counting these as 2, or 3, issues, because provides a better sense of what proportion of the papers in a year are from special issues.

**Issue:**
Missing subject: "because **this** provides" or "because **it** provides"

**Suggested Revision:**
> I'm counting these as 2, or 3, issues, because this provides a better sense of what proportion of the papers in a year are from special issues.

---

### Line 1263: Caption Issues

**Original:**
> As @tbl-issues-by-decade shows, the special issues become a big part of what _Philosophical Studies_ does in the 1990s.

**Issues:**
1. "become" - tense shift (should be past tense)
2. "what _Philosophical Studies_ does" is informal

**Suggested Revision:**
> As @tbl-issues-by-decade shows, special issues became a substantial part of _Philosophical Studies_' output in the 1990s.

---

### Table Caption (Line 1463)

**Original:**
> How many of each type of special issue were published each decade.

**Issue:**
Caption is a sentence fragment (missing question mark if question, or should be rephrased)

**Suggested Revision:**
> Number of each type of special issue published per decade.

**Alternative:**
> Special issues by type and decade.

---

### Line 1468: Transition Sentence

**Original:**
> The special issues differ from the normal issues in some striking ways, so it will be helpful to keep their presence in mind.

**Issues:**
1. Somewhat vague ("some striking ways")
2. Weak ending to section

**Suggested Revision:**
> The special issues differ from normal issues in citation patterns and content focus, differences that become important in the analysis that follows.

**Alternative:**
> Special issues exhibit distinct citation patterns and topical emphases, as subsequent sections will demonstrate.

---

## Section 2.4: Methods - Sources

### Line 1476: Bracketed Text

**Original:**
> Through the [my university] I downloaded the Web of Science (hereafter, WoS) Core Collection in XML format.

**Issue:**
Placeholder text "[my university]" needs to be replaced or removed

**Suggested Revision:**
> Through my university library, I downloaded the Web of Science (hereafter, WoS) Core Collection in XML format.

**Alternative:**
> I downloaded the Web of Science (hereafter, WoS) Core Collection in XML format.

---

### Line 1476: Sentence Structure

**Original:**
> The journals I selected are, like _Philosophical Studies_ primarily English-language, analytic philosophy journals.

**Issue:**
Missing comma after "_Philosophical Studies_"

**Suggested Revision:**
> The journals I selected are, like _Philosophical Studies_, primarily English-language, analytic philosophy journals.

---

### Line 1478: Typo

**Original:**
> So for this study I've excluded all the supplemenmts to _Noûs_

**Issue:**
Typo: "supplemenmts" should be "supplements"

**Suggested Revision:**
> So for this study I've excluded all the supplements to _Noûs_

---

### Line 1478: Citation Format

**Original:**
> As Eugenio @Petrovich2024 [77n10] notes,

**Issue:**
Citation format: should be "@Petrovich2024 [77n10]" or "Eugenio Petrovich [-@Petrovich2024, 77n10]" depending on desired format

**Suggested Revision:**
> As @Petrovich2024 [77n10] notes,

**Alternative:**
> As Petrovich [-@Petrovich2024, 77n10] notes,

---

### Line 1482: Forward Reference

**Original:**
> It also provides word counts for the articles, which I have used in @sec-overview.

**Issue:**
This is IN section 2 (Overview), so the reference is confusing

**Suggested Revision:**
> It also provides word counts for the articles, which I have used in Section 2.2.

**Alternative:**
> It also provides word counts for the articles, as discussed earlier.

---

## Section 2.5: Articles?

### Line 1496: Typo

**Original:**
> There is one place we're I've overridden WoS's classifications.

**Issue:**
Typo: "we're" should be "where"

**Suggested Revision:**
> There is one place where I've overridden WoS's classifications.

---

### Line 1496: Reference Format Issues

**Original:**
> So important articles by Stanley @WOSA1962CGX0500005, Jonathan @WOS000272855000002, and Harvey @Lederman2022PR all got listed as not being articles.

**Issues:**
1. Inconsistent citation format (some have journal codes, one doesn't)
2. Missing surnames for first two authors
3. "got listed" is informal

**Suggested Revision:**
> So important articles by @WOSA1962CGX0500005, @WOS000272855000002, and @Lederman2022PR were all classified as non-articles.

**Alternative (if you want names):**
> So important articles by Cavell [-@WOSA1962CGX0500005], Schaffer [-@WOS000272855000002], and Lederman [-@Lederman2022PR] were all classified as non-articles.

### Line 1498: Citation Format

**Original:**
> Occasionally, as when Andy @Egan2011 was the commentator on an important paper by Tamar Szabò @WOS000295087100003,

**Issue:**
Inconsistent citation format and author names

**Suggested Revision:**

## Overall Section 2 Assessment

### Strengths:
- Comprehensive overview of editorial history
- Good use of multiple figures to illustrate trends
- Careful discussion of methodological issues
- Transparent about data limitations

### Areas for Improvement:
- Several typos and spelling errors (Tuscon, supplemenmts, we're/where, Divsion)
- Some inconsistent citation formats
- A few run-on sentences that could be broken up
- Some informal language ("mostly gone," "got listed")
- Inconsistent spelling (recognised vs recognized)

### Transition Issues:
- Good transition between subsections within Section 2
- Could strengthen the transition from Section 2 to Section 3 (Methods to Outbound Citations)

### Suggested Additional Transition:
At the end of Section 2, before Section 3, consider adding:

> Having established the journal's publication patterns and methodological framework, I now turn to analyzing how _Philosophical Studies_ articles have been cited over time.

## Clean Revised Key Passages

### Editorial History Opening (Line 1179):
**Revised:**
> Three features of this editorial history will prove important in what follows. First, the names here include several of the most important epistemologists of the last half century. Second, the journal has had remarkably stable editorial leadership; a comparable summary for most other leading journals would take twice as long to write. Third, the biggest single change—the transition from John Pollock to Stewart Cohen as Editor in 1992—does not appear to have had an immediate impact on the journal. You see dramatic changes straight away at _Mind_ when G. E. Moore takes over in 1921, and again when Gilbert Ryle takes over in 1947. The effects of the switch from Pollock to Cohen are much more delayed.

### Articles Section Opening (Line 1183):
**Revised:**
> _Philosophical Studies_ increased its output considerably when it moved to Reidel, and then increased it again between 1980 and 2019. Four figures illustrate these publication trends. @fig-article-count-by-year shows how many articles _Philosophical Studies_ has published each year. @fig-word-count-by-year shows the total word count for the journal each year. @fig-word-max-by-year shows the length of the longest article each year. @fig-word-quartiles shows the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile article lengths for each year.

### Colloquium Paragraph (Line 1249):
**Revised:**
> Articles have been getting longer all across philosophy. What's striking in @fig-word-quartiles is the 25th percentile rising to over 8000 words by the end of the 2010s. It used to be common for philosophy colloquia to include papers that were read aloud by the author—a practice that has largely disappeared in recent years. By the mid-2010s, however, reading papers aloud had become impractical. Authors were no longer writing papers that could be presented orally within a typical colloquium time slot.

### Special Issues Conclusion (Line 1468):
**Revised:**
> Special issues exhibit distinct citation patterns and topical emphases, as subsequent sections will demonstrate.
