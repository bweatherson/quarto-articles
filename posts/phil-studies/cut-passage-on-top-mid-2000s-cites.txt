What's more useful is to look at how things changed in the mid-2000s. Part of the story is that _Philosophical Studies_ started publishing more articles that got a large number of citations. @tbl-top-mid-2000s shows the citation count for some prominent articles from 2003-2007, along with their rank (by citations in philosophy journals) among all articles ever published in _Philosophical Studies_.

While it is notable that this five year period included 9 of the top 30 articles by citations, including the top one^[There is a huge gender bias in citations, at least before very recent years, so it is unusual for a journal to have its most cited article be one written by a woman. The gender imbalance in the rest of the list is more typical. This does change a bit if you look just at citations since about 2016, and when we get more data in from the 2020s, it will be very interesting to see how much it has changed.], this isn't all of the story. Just as important is how widely spread around the citations were.
