  *Philosophical Studies* has become one of the most important journals for work in several large topics in philosophy. This paper uses data from the word distributions in those papers, and the citations of the papers, to look at how it has changed over time, and how it became so central.

Notes - including things that JSTOR counts as book reviews
Not including things that WOS counts as discussions
This is, to put it mildly, a bit random; some precis are included, some aren't; some replies are included, some aren't. In general if the word 'comment' appears in the title excluded, but it's a bit random. But going with them seems best.
Alternative is to work through 100 other journals if we wanted an apples-to-apples comparison.
