In two excellent recent papers, [@Ross2010] and [@Ross2012], Jacob Ross
has argued that the standard arguments for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer
to the Sleeping Beauty puzzle lead to violations of countable
additivity. The problem is that most arguments for the
$\frac{1}{3}$ answer generalise in awkward ways when he look at the
whole class of what he calls *Sleeping Beauty problems*.

Ross shows that this Principle leads to violations of countable
additivity, and argues (convincingly to my mind) that this is a serious
problem for the Principle. In @Ross2010 he argues that many arguments
for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer imply the Generalised Thirder
Principle, and in @Ross2012 he argues that the same is true of the
argument for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer in @Weatherson-SoSB. He
suggests that we have some inductive reason to think that *all*
arguments for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer will imply the Generalised
Thirder Principle. In reply I want to make three points.

First, Ross offers a much more careful presentation and analysis of the
argument for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer than appears in
@Weatherson-SoSB, and that analysis does really suggest that the
argument overgenerates. But second, the careful setting out suggests
that the argument fails by its own standards; it commits a fallacy of
equivocation. So I don't think it's as much inductive evidence for
Ross's general conclusion about all arguments for the
$\frac{1}{3}$ answer as he suggests. And third, the inductive
conclusion Ross draws is not true. There are arguments for the
$\frac{1}{3}$ answer that don't imply the Generalised Thirder
principle. Below I outline two ways to fix the argument in
@Weatherson-SoSB so that it becomes such an argument.

It will be worthwhile having a minimal example of where the Generalised
Thirder principle goes beyond the arguments for the
$\frac{1}{3}$ answer, so consider the following minimal version.

The Generalised Thirder says that it should be $\frac{1}{4}$. One of
our aims here will be to come up with an argument for the
$\frac{1}{3}$ answer in the original puzzle that doesn't imply the
answer to the Three-Day Sleeping Beauty puzzle is $\frac{1}{4}$.

Returning to the original puzzle, Let *Cr*$_1$ be Beauty's credence
function when she wakes on Monday. Let $M$ be the proposition Beauty
would express on waking with "Today is Monday". And let $H$ be the
proposition that the coin landed heads. The $\frac{1}{3}$ answer
entails that the following claims are all true.

1.  *Cr*$_1$$(M \wedge H)$ = *Cr*$_1$$(M \wedge \neg H)$

2.  *Cr*$_1$$(\neg M \wedge \neg H)$

3.  *Cr*$_1$$(M \wedge \neg H)$ = *Cr*$_1$$(\neg M \wedge \neg H)$

The usual argument for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer argues for
(1) and
(2)Cr, and then derives
(3). And
the arguments for
(2)
Cr typically generalise into arguments for the
Generalised Thirder Principle, and hence to violations of countable
additivity.

To get a bit better feel for what's going on with these principles,
consider one interesting sub-class of Ross's large category of Sleeping
Beauty problems. These are problems where there are $n$ chance
hypotheses, and for any $i$ such that $1 \leq i \leq n$, Beauty is woken
$i$ times if chance hypothesis $h_i$ is true. When she wakes up, we can
let the proposition $p_{ji}$, where $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$, be the
proposition that this is the $i$'th day, and chance hypothesis $h_j$ is
true. The following table, where the chance hypotheses are on the rows,
and days are on the columns, represents the possibilities as they strike
Beauty.

::: {.center}
            Day 1      Day 2     $\dots$   Day $n$
  ------- ---------- ---------- --------- ----------
    $h_1$  $p_{11}$                       
    $h_2$  $p_{12}$   $p_{22}$            
      ...                                 
    $h_n$  $p_{1n}$   $p_{2n}$   $\dots$   $p_{nn}$
  ------- ---------- ---------- --------- ----------
:::

The usual argument for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer to Sleeping Beauty
includes a 'vertical' argument and a 'horizontal' argument. The
'vertical' argument attempts to show that
$\text{Cr}_1(p_{1i} | p_{11} \vee \dots \vee p_{1n}) = Ch(h_i)$.
The 'horizontal' argument attempts to show that
$\text{Cr}_1(p_{ji} | p_{i1} \vee \dots \vee p_{ii}) = \frac{1}{i}$.
Or, at least, it attempts to show that those claims are true for the
special case where $n = 2$. but as Ross shows, the arguments offered
seem to work in the $n = 2$ case iff they work in the general case. And
these vertical and horizontal arguments together do imply the
Generalised Thirder Principle.

The argument in @Weatherson-SoSB took a different tack. It argued for
(1)
 and
(3), and
derived (2)
Cr. In terms of the table above, the idea was to
replace the 'horizontal' argument, and indeed to reject its conclusion
in the general case, with a 'diagonal' argument, which showed that
$\text{Cr}_1(p_{ii} | p_{11} \vee \dots \vee p_{nn}) = Ch(h_i)$.
If the vertical and diagonal arguments worked, and didn't
overgeneralise, then they wouldn't entail a solution for cases like
Three-Day Sleeping Beauty, or about any case from the above class where
$n > 2$.

If we drop the restriction to Sleeping Beauty problems where Beauty is
woken $i$ times if chance hypothesis $h_i$ is true, and return to Ross's
more general class, the arguments in @Weatherson-SoSB were meant to
prove the following two claims, and not a lot more.

First Day

:   In any Sleeping Beauty problem where Beauty wakes at least one time
    in every chance hypothesis, and exactly one time in at least one of
    them, when she wakes the first time, her conditional credences in
    each hypothesis in $S$, conditional on this actually being the first
    waking, equals the objective chance of each such hypothesis.

Last Day

:   In any Sleeping Beauty problem where Beauty wakes at least one time
    in every chance hypothesis,, when she wakes the first time, her
    conditional credences in each hypothesis in $S$, conditional on this
    actually being the last waking, equals the objective chance of each
    such hypothesis.

Since **First Day** entails
(1)
, and **Last Day** entails
(3),
these principles entail the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer. But they don't
settle what to say about the Three-Day Sleeping Beauty example. If
*Cr*$_3$ is Beauty's credences when she wakes for the first time in that
example, these principles are consistent with Beauty having the
following credal distribution. $$\begin{aligned}
\text{Cr}_3(\text{Today is Monday and Heads}) &= \frac{1}{5} \\
\text{Cr}_3(\text{Today is Monday and Tails}) &= \frac{1}{5} \\
\text{Cr}_3(\text{Today is Tuesday and Tails}) &= \frac{2}{5} \\
\text{Cr}_3(\text{Today is Wednesday and Tails}) &= \frac{1}{5} \end{aligned}$$
But those credences are incompatible with the Generalised Thirder
Principle, so **First Day** and **Last Day** do not entail that
principle.

@Ross2012 argues that this isn't right, and that the motivation for
**First Day** offered in @Weatherson-SoSB in fact does lead to the
Generalised Thirder Principle on its own. I think that's true in a
sense; the argument provides just as much support for the Generalised
Thirder Principle as it does for **First Day**. But that's because it is
a bad argument, and doesn't support **First Day**. We'll see why that's
true shortly. But since it is true, a new argument is needed for
(1)
, one that supports **First Day**, but not the
Generalised Thirder principle.

Most discussions of Sleeping Beauty assume that the contents of
propositional attitudes are sets of centered worlds. Following
@Stalnaker2008, the argument in @Weatherson-SoSB tried to get by with
propositions simply being sets of worlds. The key idea was that the
worlds themselves would be fine-grained enough that thoughts like
*Hesperus is Phosophorus*, or *Today is Monday* would be contingently
true if true at all. Very roughly, we associate singular terms with
something like Fregean senses.[^2] When Beauty wonders whether today is
Monday, she isn't wondering about whether an instance of the law of
identity is true. She has no more interest in that law than does the
first gentleman of Europe. She is wondering, in effect, whether two
senses, TODAY and MONDAY, have the same referent.

This way of looking at things implies that credal dynamics need to be
complicated. Sometimes our credences change because we acquire more
information, and we react accordingly. But sometimes our credences
change because we acquire new senses, and we can think new thoughts.
That will become crucial in what follows.

There is a quick argument for **Last Day**. Consider what happens after
Beauty wakes up at the end of the puzzle, and is told that the game is
over. (That is, on Wednesday in the original puzzle, or on Thursday in
the three-day variant.) Plausibly, her credence in $H$ should be back to
$\frac{1}{2}$, or at least it is hard to see a good argument why it
should be anything else.[^3] She can also think back to her last waking,
and think to herself *If H, that was on Monday, and if $\neg$H, that was
on Tuesday*. (She'll replace *Tuesday* with *Wednesday* in the three-day
variant.) Call this conditional $C$. Now think back to that last waking.
At that time she is wondering various thoughts about the waking she is
currently undergoing, a waking she will describe as "this waking". When
she wakes on Wednesday, and thinks about "that waking", it is plausible
she is thinking the very same kind of Fregean thought. She is thinking
about the same thing, and thinking about it in the same kind of way. If
that's right, then the big difference between her credences after the
puzzle ends and her credences on the last waking are just that she comes
to learn $C$. So on the last waking, her credence in $H$ conditional on
$C$ should be $\frac{1}{2}$, since when she learns $C$ and nothing
else, her credence in $H$ becomes $\frac{1}{2}$. And that entails
(3), and
similar reasoning generalises to all Sleeping Beauty problems to entail
**Last Day**.[^4]

The argument in @Weatherson-SoSB for
(1)
, and for **First Day**, involved a rather
baroque variant of the example involving time travelers. And, as we've
noted already, it also involves some fallacious equivocation. Before we
get to that, it is worth noting two other arguments for the same
conclusion, neither of which generalise to the Generalised Thirder
Principle. Both arguments have contentious premises, but they are
somewhat independent, so I hope that presenting both arguments will
increase the number of people who agree with **FirstDay**.

The first argument is an argument from the Principal Principle. Consider
the version of the Sleeping Beauty puzzle where the coin is tossed after
Beauty goes back to sleep on Monday. (We didn't say so far when the coin
is tossed, and it was consistent with everything we said that it is
Monday night.) And assume that Beauty knows that the coin is tossed
Monday. So when she wakes on Monday, she knows that the chance of $H$ is
$\frac{1}{2}$ if it is Monday. That is,
$\text{Cr}_1(Ch(H) = \frac{1}{2} | M) = 1$. The Principal
Principle says that unless Beauty has inadmissible evidence,
$\text{Cr}_1(H | Cr(H) = \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{2}$.
And plausibly she doesn't have any inadmissible evidence conditional on
it being Monday. Putting these two together, we get
$\text{Cr}_1(H | M) = \frac{1}{2}$. And that kind of
reasoning generalises to support **First Day**.

The argument here is similar to the original argument given for
(1)
 in @Elga2000. Elga imagines a variant of the
example where Beauty is told, sometime after she wakes up, that it is
Monday, and argues that after that she should have credence
$\frac{1}{2}$ in $H$, and derives
(1)
 from that. @Halpern2004 objects to this
argument on the grounds that the possibility of Beauty being told what
day it is undermines the indistinguishability of the wakings, and this
undermines Elga's own argument for
(2)
Cr. I'm not sure Halpern is right, but in any
case, this argument doesn't rely on any possibility of Beauty being told
what day it is. I imagine that some people will object to the claim that
Beauty has no inadmissible evidence. But it is hard to see what she
knows which is inadmissible, at least conditional on it being Monday.
She *knows* that if it is Monday, the truth of $H$ rests on a chance
event that is yet to take place, and from which she is causally
isolated. That looks to me like knowledge that she has no inadmissible
evidence.

The second argument is a version of the the Technicolor Beauty argument
in @Titlebaum2008. It relies on a variant of the example that drops the
idea that the wakings are indistinguishable in a strong sense. I'll set
up first what the idea behind the argument is, and then set out how it
works. Assume that Beauty can think about $M$ on Sunday. Follow Ross in
using *Cr*$_0$ for Beauty's credences on Sunday. The same Principal
Principle style argument we used above suggests that
$\text{Cr}_0(H | M) = \frac{1}{2}$. Indeed in this case the
argument is even stronger, since everyone agrees that on Sunday, Beauty
has no inadmissible evidence. But nothing happens to surprise Beauty
between Sunday and Monday, so
$\text{Cr}_1(H | M) = \frac{1}{2}$ should be
$\frac{1}{2}$ as well, and we derive
(1)
 from there.

There are a few problems with this argument. For one thing, the 'no
surprise' premise goes by very quickly. More importantly, Beauty can't
actually have $M$ thoughts on Sunday. She can think to herself that
Monday is Monday, or at least she could if she cared to think about the
law of identity. But that's not the same thought as $M$. Remember, the
guiding idea here is that contents are Fregean; it isn't easy to have
the same thought as someone who thinks *This is Monday*. Something
dramatic needs to happen to let Beauty have such a thought on Sunday,
when she isn't in a position to make the same kind of demonstration as
she is on Monday.

Here's one way the dramatic thing might happen. Change the example so
that the wakings Beauty undergoes are not *phenomenally*
indistinguishable. In fact, Beauty is told on Sunday that each waking
will be in a brightly coloured room, and the colours will be different
each day. As it happens, the room that will be used for Monday is red,
though Beauty doesn't know that. Let $RE$ be the proposition that one of
Beauty's wakings will be in a red room, and $RM$ be the proposition that
she wakes Monday in a red room. Now clearly $RE$, on its own, is
inadmissible evidence in the sense that *Cr*$_0$$(H | RE)$ need not be
$\frac{1}{2}$. After all, $RE$ is probabilistic evidence that Beauty
has more than one waking, since the more wakings she has, the more
chance there is that one of them will be in a red room. On the other
hand, $RM$ does not look like inadmissible evidence. She has to wake up
in some colour room or other on Monday; learning it is red doesn't
change anything. So *Cr*$_0$$(H | RM)$ should be $\frac{1}{2}$. And
that's true even though $RM$ obviously entails $RE$.

Now she wakes on Monday, and the room is red. What follows? Well, she
now knows $RE$. And she can identify her current waking with the red
waking she imagined (or at least could have imagined) on Sunday. So it
is at least arguable that when on Monday she considers the thought *This
waking is on Monday*, that's the very same thought she considers on
Sunday by saying to herself *The waking in a red room is on Monday*.
Making that last claim more plausible would require offering a more
detailed theory of mental content than I have the space (or ability) to
do here. For now I'm just going to take as a premise that there's a
workable theory of mental content that types contents more finely than
does a purely referential theory, but on which it is nevertheless the
case that Beauty's demonstrative thought on Monday has the same content
as her descriptive thought (about the waking in the red room) does on
Sunday.

Here is one way of thinking about that claim about content that may make
it more plausible. (This idea is derived from the arguments in
@Jeshion2002.) Imagine that on Sunday Beauty names the waking in a red
room. She calls it 'Bluey'. She knows that 'Bluey' might not refer. That
is, she knows that Bluey, like Vulcan and Sherlock Holmes, might not
exist. But she nevertheless entertains detailed thoughts about Bluey.
She wonders if Bluey will be on Monday, whether she'll be happy when
Bluey happens, and so on. Now she wakes up on Monday, and sees the red
walls. She says to herself, "This is Bluey". From that point on, it
seems that she'd express the same thought with *This waking is
$\varphi$* and *Bluey is $\varphi$*, and it seems she's express the same
thought with *Bluey is $\varphi$* and *The waking in a red room is
$\varphi$.* By appeal to transitivity of identity, and substituting a
particular value for $\varphi$, we get that she expresses the same
thought by saying *This waking is on Monday* as by saying *The waking in
a red room is on Monday*.

If that claim about content is right, then *all* that happens on Monday
is that Beauty learns that $RE$ is true. She doesn't acquire the ability
to think new thoughts, or to make fresh divisions in possibility space,
the way that she does in the standard version of the puzzle. In the
standard version of the puzzle, the demonstrative thought she considers
on Monday, the one she would express by saying *This is Monday*, is not
equivalent to anything she can think on Sunday. So when she wakes, she
not only acquires some evidence, she acquires a new cognitive capacity.
That doesn't happen here, which makes the calculations easier.

In particular, it lets us appeal to the following key fact. If $E_2$
entails $E_1$, and a particular update only involves conditionalising
one's prior credences, then learning $E_1$ doesn't change the
conditional credence of anything given $E_2$. That's a consequence of
the following theorem. Let $\Pr$ be any probability function, and let
$\Pr^+$ be the result of conditionalising that function on $E_1$. Then
$\Pr(H | E_2) = \Pr^+(H | E_2)$. So if Beauty only learns $RE$, that
doesn't change the conditional credence of anything given $RM$. In
particular, it doesn't change the conditional credence of $H$ given
$RM$. So *Cr*$_1$$(H | RM)$ = $\frac{1}{2}$. And since $M$ and $RM$
are trivially equivalent, since Beauty can see the room is red, it
follows that *Cr*$_1$$(H | M)$ = $\frac{1}{2}$, as required.

I suspect the main objection to this argument will be that adding the
room colours makes a substantial change to the problem. The fact that
$\frac{1}{3}$ is the correct answer in this technicolour version of
Sleeping Beauty, says the objector, is no reason to think that it is
also the correct answer in the version where the wakings are
phenomenally indistinguishable. But I think the objector will have a
hard time making the case that phenomenal indistinguishability is
epistemically significant unless they want to defend what
@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 calls the 'phenomenal conception of evidence'.
As has been pointed out in prior work on Sleeping Beauty, the different
wakings are not evidentially equivalent; when she wakes up and sees that
*this* waking is happening, that's a piece of evidence she gets in some
but not all wakings. (This point is made in @Weintraub2004 and
@Stalnaker2008.) It might well be argued that this demonstrative
evidence is in a sense symmetric; although she gets evidence that is
different in some sense on the different wakings, the force of that
evidence is the same. But that's still true in the technicolour version
of the problem as well. So I think, contra the objector, that this is a
good argument for
(1)
.

But neither of those were the argument offered in @Weatherson-SoSB. That
argument involved a rather baroque modification to the puzzle. A time
traveller films Beauty waking on Monday and travels back to Sunday to
show Beauty the film. After she sees the film, and can think about the
waking it depicts, the traveller tells her that he took it on Monday. He
then wipes Beauty's memories of this telling, but not of the showing of
the film. The argument then proceeds as follows.

1.  On Sunday, she can think about her Monday waking in the same way as
    she thinks about it on Monday when she wakes, thanks to the time
    traveller's film.

2.  On Sunday, the rational credence in $H$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.

3.  If premise 1 is true, then on Monday, after she wakes, the only
    difference between her epistemic state then and her epistemic state
    after being told that the film was of Monday is that she no longer
    knows $M$.

4.  If the only difference between two epistemic states is that in the
    first, an agent knows $M$ and in the second she does not, then the
    rational credence of $H$ given $M$ in the second state equals the
    rational credence of $H$ in the first state.

And from that $\text{Cr}_1(H | M) =$$\frac{1}{2}$ was
claimed to follow. Now there wasn't much of an argument for the first
premise offered, and it might well be thought objectionable. It
certainly relies on a liberal conception of sameness of 'ways of
thinking'. But let's set that aside, because there is a much bigger
problem with the argument. It hopelessly equivocates on the phrase 'On
Sunday'. Let's distinguish the following four times that are all on
Sunday.

-   $t_1$ is before the time traveller turns up.

-   $t_2$ is immediately after the time traveller shows Beauty the film.

-   $t_3$ is immediately after the time traveller tells Beauty that the
    film is of Monday.

-   $t_4$ is after the time traveller wipes Beauty's memories of that
    telling, but not of the showing of the film.

Now let's consider the first two premises in Weatherson's argument. The
first premise is clearly false if 'On Sunday' refers to $t_1$, but
arguably true if it refers to $t_2, t_3$ or $t_4$. The second premise is
clearly true if 'On Sunday' refers to $t_1$, but much less plausible if
it refers to any later time. If it refers to $t_2$ or $t_4$, it is
arguably equivalent to the $\frac{1}{2}$ answer to the original
Sleeping Beauty problem, which makes it pretty useless in an argument
for the $\frac{1}{3}$ answer! If it refers to $t_3$, it is much too
close to what we're trying to prove in arguing for **FirstDay**, so it
is still argumentatively useless.

Ross argues that the style of argument we've been considering would, if
it showed that (1)
, and indeed more generally supported **First
Day**, would show much more. In fact, it would show that for any two
chance hypotheses $h_i$ and $h_j$, and any $k$ such that $h_j$ is
consistent with at least $k$ wakings, that the following is true. (I'll
again use $p_{kj}$ to mean that this is the $k$'th waking and $h_j$ is
true.)

$$\text{Cr}_1(p_{1i} | (p_{1i} \vee p_{kj})) = \frac{Ch(h_i)}{Ch(h_i) + Ch(h_j)}$$

And from that we can derive the Generalised Thirder Principle, and hence
countable additivity violations. That wasn't what was intended; the
argument was only designed to work for the special case where $k = 1$,
i.e., **First Day**. Now I think Ross is right in the following sense;
there's just as good an argument in @Weatherson-SoSB for the above
equation as there is for **First Day**. But that argument is no good for
the reasons described above. Let's see where the same equivocation comes
into Ross's telling of the story. I've changed Ross's notation a fair
bit into notation I find easier to work with. Hopefully I haven't lost
anything in the process. I'm also going to focus on the special case of
Three-Day Sleeping Beauty, where $h_1$ is the coin lands heads and $h_2$
is the coin lands tails, and on the case where $k = 2$. So what we're
really going to look at is whether there's an argument in Three-Day
Sleeping Beauty for this equation.

$$\text{Cr}_3(p_{11} | (p_{11} \vee p_{22})) = \frac{Ch(h_1)}{Ch(h_1) + Ch(h_2)} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Now as noted above, I think that this equation need not hold in
Three-Day Sleeping Beauty; in the model I gave for it earlier,
$\text{Cr}_3(p_{11}) = \frac{1}{5}$, and
$\text{Cr}_3(p_{22}) = \frac{2}{5}$, so
$\text{Cr}_3(p_{11} | (p_{11} \vee p_{22})) =$
$\frac{1}{3}$. But let's see how Ross derives the
$\frac{1}{2}$ answer.

Again there is a time-traveller who shows Beauty a film. But this isn't
necessarily a film of the first waking; the time traveller films the
first waking if $h_1$, and the second waking if $h_2$. After seeing the
film, Beauty is told this. So on Sunday, says Ross, Beauty's credences
should satisfy these constraints. (I'm following Ross in using *Cr*$_0$
for the Sunday credences.) $$\begin{aligned}
\text{Cr}_0(h_1) &= \text{Cr}_0(h_1 \wedge p_{11}) \\
\text{Cr}_0(h_1) &= Ch(h_1)\end{aligned}$$

There are other premises used, but these will be the crucial ones.
They're crucial because there's no good reason to think that there's
*any* time Sunday when Beauty's credences should satisfy both these
equations. Before she sees the film, she can't even think about
propositions like $p_{11}$, since she can't have singular thoughts about
the waking it depicts. After she sees the film, there is no reason to
think that her credences should align with chances. Causal contact with
a time traveller who brings information that may well be about a time
after the chance event, evidence whose existence may depend on the
outcome of the chance event, is pretty much paradigmatically
inadmissible evidence for the purposes of the Principal Principle. So
after the film, there is no reason to think
$\text{Cr}_0(h_1) = Ch(h_1)$.

I should stress that Ross doesn't *endorse* the equivocating premises
here; he merely attributes them to @Weatherson-SoSB, and fairly so. But
I think once we see the equivocation we can see there is no fear the
kind of argument used in @Weatherson-SoSB will lead to the Generalised
Thirder Principle. That argument is too flawed to lead to anything. But
there are plenty of other arguments for **First Day**, such as the two
arguments offered here. And both of those arguments rely on distinctive
features of the first day. Most notably, they rely on the fact that for
all we say in the setup of the problem, the first waking is before the
chance event. So there's no reason to think they will have the
problematic consequences that Ross finds in the argument for **First
Day** in @Weatherson-SoSB.

[^1]: I have some concerns about what 'indistinguishable' means in this
    context. We'll come back to that issue a lot in what follows.

[^2]: In @Weatherson-SoSB these are described as haeceitties, but this
    is misleading at best. It is crucial that 'Hesperus' and
    'Phosphorus' have different associations, but intuitively they have
    the same haecceity. Thinking of the associations as being with
    something like senses is better.

[^3]: One might be tempted by a seemingly stronger argument. For
    instance, one could argue that on Wednesday, Beauty knows that the
    chance of $H$ was $\frac{1}{2}$, and she has no inadmissible
    evidence, so by the Principal Principle her credence in $H$ should
    be $\frac{1}{2}$. But it isn't clear that she has no
    inadmissible evidence; perhaps the evidence she would express by
    thinking back to her last waking and saying *That waking happened*
    is inadmissible. Or one might be tempted by a Reflection Principle
    based argument against any alternative credence. But such arguments
    seem to lead to odd results in general around Sleeping Beauty. It's
    best, I think, to stick with the clear intuition that on Wednesday
    her credence in $H$ should be $\frac{1}{2}$.

[^4]: Strictly speaking, all we've really shown is that Beauty's
    credences on the last day she wakes should satisfy **Last Day**. So
    if the focus of the puzzle is on her credences on the first day, all
    we've strictly speaking shown is that if $H$, then **Last Day** is
    true. I think it is plausible that **Last Day** should be
    independent of how the coin lands, but I admit that I don't have an
    argument against someone who wants to dispute this.
