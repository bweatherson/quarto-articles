Most decision theorists, at least in philosophy, are what I'll call **prescriptivists**. The prescriptivist view on decision theory is the conjunction of two theses:

P1
:    Decision theory describes what ideal deciders are like, and provides a standard of evaluation for actual deciders: good deciders resemble the ideal.

P2
:    The point of doing decision theory is to provide guidance and advice for actual deciders. By seeing the ideal more clearly, actual deciders can improve by coming to resemble it in more respects.

I think both parts of prescriptivism are wrong. More precisely, I think if those are the aims of decision theory, it is doing a bad job of meeting them, and it could not come to meet them without radical change. In place of prescriptivism, I endorse **explanationism**, which replaces those two theses with alternatives.

E1
:    Decision theory describes what ideal deciders are like, and predicts that in suitable circumstances, actual deciders will resemble them.

E2
:    The point of doing decision theory is to provide an input into explanations of social phenomena, in cases where actual deciders behave sufficiently similarly to ideal deciders.

In short, explanationism says that when we're doing decision theory, we're offering an idealised description of a part of social reality, and we're doing so because these idealised descriptions feed into useful explanations.

Prescriptivism and explanationism are contraries, but they aren't the only option. David Lewis endorsed a view that replaced P2 and E2 with the claim that the point of decision theory was to provide an input into the theory of mental content. His theory of mind had a central place for "constitutive rationality" [citation needed], and by doing decision theory we helped spell out the rationality part of that.
