Intro

Contemporary decision theory is, for the most part, highly idealised. The agents described are capable of carrying out, or at least acting as if they can carry out, arbitrarily complex computations. What does this fact tell us about the project of decision theory? In particular, how does this fact constrain our answers to these two questions:

Erotetic question
:    What question could decision theorists be trying to answer such that the answers they give are plausible?

Purpose question
:    Why should we be interested in this question?

One natural view, which I'll call the **Evaluative View** is that decision theory is saying what is the best thing to do in various situations, and this is interesting because knowing what is best is a way for us to be better. I'm going to argue that both parts of the Evaluative View are mistaken.

In its place, I'll argue for the **Descriptive View**. This says that decision theory is the project of describing what agents would are idealised in certain ways would do, in various situations. By describing these agents, they provide building blocks for interesting explanations of various social phenomena.
