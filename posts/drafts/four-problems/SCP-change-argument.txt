This argument starts with a story. Imagine the game master (GM) is chatting to Chooser (C), before Chooser plays @fig-switching-example.

> GM: What are you thinking of playing?    
> C: I might not have a choice.    
> GM: True, but assume you have to choose.    
> C: Then Up, I guess.    
> GM: You know, Demon can be really slow in making a prediction. Do you want to write your choice down in an envelope, and we'll open it if it's needed?
> C: Oh sure. I'm writing Down.    
> GM: Why did you change your mind?

We could continue the conversation, but I want to focus on the presupposition of GM's last question. It seems appropriate to presuppose here that Chooser has changed their mind. This presupposition requires the SCP. If the SCP is false, Chooser has simply given different answers to different questions. First they were asked what to do in the dynamic game, and they said Up. Then they were asked what to do in the strategic game, and they said Down. Giving different answers to different questions is not changing one's mind.

GM's question seems appropriate. Chooser was first asked what they planned to do in a particular situation. Then they were asked for a strategy that would only be activated in that very situation. When they give different answers to those questions, it sounds like they changed their mind. That implies the questions are fundamentally the same, which is what the SCP says.
