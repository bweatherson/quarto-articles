Plan

- Periodization in history, with Roman examples
- Early analytic - positivism - ordinary language
- Long time since a new break
- The book uses LAP to mean really since 1970 or so
- Eugenio has one point suggesting maybe a break around 2000
- I think that's interesting, and worth exploring, but ultimately not the case
- My positive view (that I won't defend): there's an era from roughly 1970-2010 that I call the modal era, and a new one from 2010 onwards I call the social era. 
- Modal isn't perfect: suggests that Naming and Necessity & Counterfactuals are more important exemplars of the new era than Theory of Justice and In Defence of Abortion, but it'll do. It also helps put 2010 as a break point; that's when modality ceases to be central.

- Describe Eugenio's study
- Key feature: narrow range of citing sources; universal cited sources
- Talk about the breaks around 2000

- Possible hypotheses
- Tech: Changed how people read, how they communicated, and how they organised - much easier to do conferences
- Puzzles: Non-conceptual content, zombies, fictionalism, vagueness, contextualism, verbal disputes, self-locating belief
- Change of heroes: Wittgenstein and Quine out, Kripke in. But hard to see it as sufficiently dramatic
- Journal effect: Some things moved into the journals - e.g., Nous/PPR doing more epistemology once Ernie Sosa takes over.

- My study
- Very broad range of citing sources; narrower (journals only) cited sources
- Weird dip in the 1980s
- Fifth explanation: stuff from the 1980s didn't catch on
- Some data: the graphs for 1980s years, the supervenience papers
- It doesn't quite work - the graphs in graphs_about_influence.R aren't quite right. But it's something.
