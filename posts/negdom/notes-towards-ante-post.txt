# Three approaches to decision theory

1. Start with values
2. Start with preferences
3. Start with choice sets

# From choices to preferences to values

How to get from preferences to values is well known, in philosophy
It's less talked about in philosophy, but so is how to get from choice sets to preferences
You need alpha and beta (state them)
Intuitively, beta fails for artist-banker cases
What to say about preferences in that case

1. Preferences aren't complete, full order or something
2. Preferences simply aren't defined (would you rather take one box in Newcomb's Problem or play Ke3 in this game - not would you rather move into one of those games and do that, but would you rather as is)
3. Preference is a failed concept (a la Tarski on truth/Sider on parthood)
4. Preference would be a failed concept if we insisted on these principles, so the principles must be false no matter how intuitive they are (a la Lewis on chance)

Maybe argue against Dorr et al here, comparing *Mo Salah is stronger than me*, *S5 is stronger than S4*.

# Games and Decisions

Four things that stand out from trying to derive a decision theory from game theory textbooks.

1. Mixed strategies are everywhere
2. Conservatism about dynamic choice, as opposed to resolute or sophisticated.
3. No suppositions; no box-arrows, hardly any conditional probabilities
4. No preferences

The last two take some seeing - it's not always easy to see what's not there. But try to derive from game theoretic principles what preference you should have between Rock and Scissors in Rock-Paper-Scissors. Gallow in effect assumes you should be indifferent. That's not obvious; maybe you should have no preference. It's really unclear.
