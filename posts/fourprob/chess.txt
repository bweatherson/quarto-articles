# Introducing the Single Choice Principle {#sec-scp-intro}

Think about two ways to play chess.

First, we might sit down somewhere, possibly in a park, facing each other, with a board and some pieces in front of us. We take turns moving pieces, and eventually someone wins. Probably you; I'm not very good at chess.

Second, we sit down at our computers, probably not in a park, and write code to make our computers play chess against each other. We meet, exchange code, and run the programs against each other to see who wins. It's still probably you, but my chances would be a bit better in this form.

In the first version we are playing the *dynamic* form of chess; in the second we are playing the *strategic* form. In game-theoretic language, a strategy for a game like chess is a set of instructions saying what to do in every possible state of the game.^[Standardly, this includes states that are ruled out by the earlier parts of the strategy.] An explicit strategy for chess, with a conditional saying _If in state S, make move M_ for every possible state _S_, would be unimaginably large. But code for chess computers can be quite compact; I have a few versions just on my phone.

This is a philosophy paper, so I'm going to take these mundane examples, idealise them, and evaluate the idealisations. 

The idealisation is that I'm going to not assume it's you and me playing, but two characters who have no computational limitations. I'll call one of these Chooser. 

The evaluation is that for Chooser, some moves are rational and some are not. This is true whether Chooser is playing the dynamic or the strategic form. 

To start I won't ask what moves are rational, but instead ask about the connection between the two games. In particular, are the evaluations for the two games related in the following way.

Dynamic-Strategic Equivalance (for chess)
:    Move _M_ at game state _S_ in the dynamic game is rational iff some strategy which includes _If S, do M_ is rational in the strategic game.

This is not an implausible view, in part because of some special features of chess. Chess includes no random moves by Nature, no information that is revealed to some players and not others, and it is zero-sum. By 'zero-sum', I mean that there is no pair of players and pair of game states such that both players are better off in one of the states than the other. 

Games in general need not have any of these features. _Settlers of Catan_, for example, has none of them. There are random dice rolls and card draws; while the dice are public, the cards are private; and there are mutually beneficial trades between players. Some theories say that in games with these features, especially the last, Dynamic-Strategic Equivalence can fail. (The other two features will require us to be careful in how we state Dynamic-Strategic Equivalence.)

Consider a very simplified version of the Ultimatum game. In this version, the players have \$3 to distribute. As in the standard version, Proposer will suggest a split of the money, and Respondant will accept or reject the split. If they reject it, neither player will get any money. I'll add two more simplifications. First, only proper splits are allowed; Proposer can't suggest that one or other party gets all the money. Second, the dollars cannot be split. So the only proposals are that Proposer gets \$1 and Respondant gets \$2, or that Proposer gets \$2 and Respondant gets \$1. Call these Proposals P1 and P2.

In this game, Respondant has four possible strategies. I'll write XY for responding to P1 with X and P2 with Y. So the strategy RA is the (odd) strategy of rejecting the offer of \$2 and accepting the offer of \$1. Using this terminology, this version of Ultimatum is given by @tbl-ultimatum. (As usual, I'll write the row players payouts first. This is a little misleading because we normally put the payoff of the first mover first. But it will fit better with how I'll use the game in a few paragraph.)

|       |     P1     |     P2      |
|------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
|  AA   |  \$1, \$2  |  \$2, \$1   |
|  AR   |  \$2, \$1  |  \$0, \$0   |
|  RA   |  \$0, \$0  |  \$1, \$2   |
|  RR   |  \$0, \$0  |  \$0, \$0   |

:  Ultimatum game {#tbl-ultimatum}

Assuming both players prefer more money to less, there are three Nash equilibria of this game: (P2, AA), (P2, RA), and (P1, AR). But there is only one dynamic equilibrium of the game: (P2, AA). In a one-shot version of the dynamic game, there is no payoff to ever playing R; it's always a choice between more money and less. So Respondent must play AA, and so Proposer is best off playing P2.

Let's bring this back to decision theory. Assume that Respondent is Chooser, our main subject. Assume also that Proposer is Demon, the familiar character from Newcomb's Problem. Demon, as I'll understand him, is arbitrarily good at predicting Chooser's _strategy_, and Chooser knows this.^[If we wanted realistic cases, we would make Demon only somewhat good at predicting strategies. It would still be possible to get versions of most of the examples here working, but they would be more complicated and harder to follow. Making Demon arbitrarily good loses some realism, but gains some simplicity.]

Some decisions theories say that this version of Ultimatum violates Dynamic-Strategic Equivalence (hereafter, just Equivalence). Causal decision theories that say Chooser should pick the optimal equilibrium [**include citations**] say that Chooser should play AR in the strategic game, but AA in the dynamic game. Evidential decision theoriests [**cite Ahmed**] say the same thing.

I'm going to ultimately reject these theories, but not because of what they say about this case. It is not obvious whether Dynamic-Strategic Equivalence should hold here. As I just noted, some approaches to game theory say that it should not.^[I think Equivalence does hold here because in the strategic game AA is the only option that is not weakly dominated. But I'm not going to argue for weak dominance in this paper, or work out just how it relates to Equivalence in the general case. Here, as often in this paper, I'm indebted to @Stalnaker199x.]

There is a narrower class of decision problems where Equivalence does seem intuitively compelling. A strategy in @tbl-ultimatum is a pair of conditionals. The strategy says what to do if Demon plays P1, and what to do if Demon plays P2. Consider the class of decision problems where a strategy is a single conditional. A strategy in such a problem says _If we get to this point, do X_. I call these Single Choice problems. Here's the first statement of the core premise of this paper.

Single Choice Principle (SCP)
:    In all Single Choice problems, Dynamic-Strategic Equivalence holds.

The intuition behind SCP is simple. In a dynamic Single Choice game, the only option is what to do at the point choice is called for. Assume X is a rational move to make at that point. Now think about whether the strategy _If I reach that point, do X_ is rational. Following @Ramseyxxxx, the way to answer that question is to imagine reaching the point, then asking whether it is rational to do X. And we just said that it is. So the strategy is rational. Conversely, if doing X at that point is not rational in the dynamic game, the same argument will show that the strategy _If I reach that point, do X_ is not rational.
