Points to hit

1. Comparison to Pearce on single-valued solutions
2. Ratificationism was big, but faded because of no equilibrium cases, and bad equilibrium cases
3. Positing dilemmas would solve 2
4. But positing mixed strategies would solve both
5. These are sometimes dismissed, because we don't carry randomising devices

Maybe on 5, quote Halpern - "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-symbolic-logic/article/abs/note-on-the-existence-of-ratifiable-acts/01401F183798923E4E63F7C0A2B1F5DD"

See Wallace on ideal agents and randomising - https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/8893/1/cdt_arist.pdf
Page 15 quotes on people who have been sceptical of mixtures

Maybe mention the ex post view

Maybe more general comparison to game theory
