Take Two

Decision theory should look more like game theory in five ways.

First, it should be based around equilibrium concepts. Or maybe weaker, a la Pearce.

Second, it should accept that Beta will fail, and there won't be a single solution to various problems. That probably means moving away from preferences, and certainly values, and focussing instead on choice-worthiness.

Third, it shouldn't expect to have a full theory. SCP is a constraint, and are more likely to make progress if we look for other constraints, rather than look for a full theory. The last few decades of work on 'refinements', or on the Gettier problem, should be a guide here.

Fourth, in looking for other constraints, we should look to work in game theory for useful examples. Thinking through the beer-quiche example is helpful at working out what constraints might be needed beyond SCP.

But why go to something as complicated as beer-quiche. Why not go for matching pennies, i.e., Death in Damascus? We can learn a lot by thinking about asymmetric versions of this.

|          | **PU** | **PD** |
|---------:|:------:|:------:|
| **Up**   |   1    |   11   |
| **Down** |   10   |   0    |

An asymmetric version of Death in Damascus. {#tbl-mean-demon}

Four options

1. Up is uniquely choice-worthy; that leads to SCP violations
2. Both are choice-worthy; don't know anyone who defends that.
3. It's a dilemma. This seems natural, especially since we know there are dilemmas in infinitary cases.
4. Mixed strategy

Fifth 'look like'. When ratificationism was more popular in 1980s (see Skyrms for brief bibliography), that was the usual way people handled @tbl-mean-demon (see, e.g., Harper1986).

Usual response is that mixed strategies might be unavailable - quote Arntzenius. Footnote Icard saying this trend goes back to Reichenbach.

But matrix inversion isn't always available either. The question is whether ideal agents can mnix. What we need is what Wallace says to be true.

Quote Wallace.

Is that right? Answering that requires first saying what mixed strategies are, and there are as many interpretations of that as there are interpretations of probability [cite Hajek]. And it requires getting clear on what an ideal agent is, and, ultimately, on what the purpose of ideal theorising ultimately is.

One promising line is to say that ideal theories are useful approximations to actual theories, useful and close enough to play a role in explanations. So Wallace's second point is 



Points to hit

1. Comparison to Pearce on single-valued solutions
2. Ratificationism was big, but faded because of no equilibrium cases, and bad equilibrium cases
3. Positing dilemmas would solve 2
4. But positing mixed strategies would solve both
5. These are sometimes dismissed, because we don't carry randomising devices

Maybe on 5, quote Halpern - "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-symbolic-logic/article/abs/note-on-the-existence-of-ratifiable-acts/01401F183798923E4E63F7C0A2B1F5DD"
