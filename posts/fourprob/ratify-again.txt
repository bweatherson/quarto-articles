# General Ratifiability {#sec-general-ratify}

In the previous section I argued that in any instance of Nice Demon, where Chooser gets a reward iff Demon's prediction is correct, both options are choice-worthy. In this section I generalise that result. In any instance of #tbl-generic-demon where both choices are strict equilibria, both options are choiceworthy.^[I'm grateful to Dmitri Gallow for suggestions which greatly strengthened and simplified the proof that follows.]

The proof relies on five assumptions, three of which were used in the last section: SCP, **Label Neutrality** and **Settling**.

The fourth assumption is that the values in the table are utilities, and hence are only unique up to positive affine transformation. So whatever choices are rational in a table, the same choices are rational if each payout is multiplied by a positive constant, and/or some (other constant) is added. Call this assumption **Affine Transformtation**.

The fifth and final assumption is that in two option decision problems with two strict equilibria, at least one (pure) option is choice-worthy. That is, these problems are not dilemmas (even if Chooser only plays pure strategies).

Given those assumptions, we'll show that both options are choice-worthy in two option problems where both options are strict equilibria. It simplifies the proof a little to work not with @tbl-generic-demon, but with a slightly relabeled version, as shown in @tbl-two-good.

|  **Down** |     *a*-*b*  |     *d*      |

: A problem with two strict equilibria. {#tbl-two-good}

Since the game has two strict equilibria, both *b* and *c* are positive. Assume without loss of generality that *a* and *d* are also positive. (If not use **Affine Transformation** to make them both positive.) Assume, also without loss of generality, that *b* > *c*. (If not, use **Label Neutrality** to flip the labels.)

Consider the dynamic decision problem shown in @fig-two-good. In this tree, we'll leave both the probability of tails, *p*, and the exit payout, *e*/(1-*p*), as unknows to be solved for. (This problem differs from @fig-main-example in that we don't assume the coin in stage two is fair, but we do assume the probability of Heads is known to Chooser.)

The strategic form of @fig-two-good is given by @tbl-two-good-strategic.

|           |           **PU**   |   **PD**     |
|:---------:|:------------------:|:------------:|
|  **Up**   | *pa* + *e*         |     *d*-*c*  |
|  **Down** | *p*(*a*-*b*) + *e* |     *d*      |

: The strategic form of @fig-two-good. {#tbl-two-good-strategic}

By SCP, Up is choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good iff Up is choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good-strategic. By **Label Neutrality** and **Affine Transformation**, Up is choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good iff Down is choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good-inverted. (This is because we get from @tbl-two-good to @tbl-two-good-inverted by first flipping the labels, then multiplying the payouts by *m* and adding *x* to every payout.)

|           | **PU**             |   **PD**           |
|:---------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
|  **Up**   | *md* + *x*         | *m*(*a*-*b*) + *x* |
|  **Down** | *m*(*d*-*c*) + *x* | *ma* + *x*         |

: Inverted and transformed version of @tbl-two-good. {#tbl-two-good-inverted}

If we can find values of *p*, *e*, *m* and *x* such that @tbl-two-good-strategic and @tbl-two-good-inverted are identical, it will follow that Up is choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good iff Down is choice-worthy. (Note we must also check that *m* is positive, and *p* is a probability, i.e., in [0, 1].) From that plus the no dilemmas assumption, it follows that Up and Down are both choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good, as required.

Now it's just a bit of algebra to figure out the four unknowns *p*, *e*, *m* and *x* given the four equations, i.e., the equality of matching cells in @tbl-two-good-strategic and @tbl-two-good-inverted.

\begin{align*}
(1) && pa + e &= md + x && \text{(Top left)} \\
(2) && d - c &= m(a - b) + x && \text{(Top right)} \\
(3) && p(a - b) + e &= m(d - c) + x && \text{(Bottom left)} \\
(4) && d &= ma + x && \text{(Bottom right)} \\
(5) && c &= mb && \text{(4) - (2)} \\
(6) && m &= \frac{c}{b} && \text{(5)} \\
(7) && pb &= mc && \text{(1) - (3)} \\
(8) && pb &= \frac{c^2}{b} && \text{(6), (7)} \\
(9) && p &= \frac{c^2}{b^2} && \text{(8)} \\
(10) && x &= d - c - m(a - b) && \text{(2)} \\
(11) && x &= d - c - \frac{c(a - b)}{b} && \text{(6), (10)} \\
(12) && x &= d - c - \frac{ca}{b} + c && \text{(11)} \\
(13) && x &= d - \frac{ca}{b} && \text{(12)} \\
(14) && \frac{ac^2}{b^2} + e &= \frac{dc}{b} + d - \frac{ca}{b} && \text{(1), (6), (9), (13)} \\
(15) && e &= \frac{bcd + db^2 - abc - ac^2}{b^2} && \text{(14)}
\end{align*}

Lines 6, 9, 13 and 15 give the values for the four variables. Since *b* and *c* are positive, *m* and *p* are also positive.^[Note that all we need here is that *b* and *c* have the same sign. So this argument has consequences for the case where there is no pure equilibrium. But I'm setting aside those cases, which raise issues about mixed strategies, for this paper.] Since *b* > *c*, *p* < 1, so *p* is a probability.

I won't go through all the algebra, but substituting these values for the four variables back into either @tbl-two-good-strategic or @tbl-two-good-inverted gives @tbl-two-good-final.

|           |                          **PU**   |   **PD**  |
|:---------:|:---------------------------------:|:---------:|
|  **Up**   | (*bd* + *cd* - *ac*)/*b*          | *d* - *c* |
|  **Down** | (*bd* + *cd* - *ac* - *c*^2^)/*b* | *d*       |

: Final version of @tbl-two-good. {#tbl-two-good-final}

That's enough to show, given the assumptions we started with that Up and Down are both choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good.

This doesn't yet show that any ratifiable choice is choice-worthy; it doesn't even show anything for cases where Chooser has three options. But it does show that SCP is inconsistent with any view that accepts the other four assumptions, and which says that only one option is choice-worthy in @tbl-two-good. That, as I discussed in the previous section, includes a large number of decision theories philosophers have defended.
