# Future Directions {#sec-conclusion}

The Single Choice Principle pushes decision theory to be more like game theory. In this conclusion I'll go over five ways in which decision theory and game theory could be brought into closer harmony, and suggest some ways to make progress on questions I've left open in earlier sections.

The first and most obvious way in which decision theory could more closely resemble game theory is that it could use more equilibrium, or equilibrium-like, concepts, rather than using maximising concepts. I say 'equilibrium-like' because it might be that the most important notion to use is _rationalizability_, as developed by @Bernheim1984 and @Pearce1984.^[This paper started out as a commentary on two arguments by David Pearce: his dynamic objection to 'single-valued' solution concepts [-@Pearce1983] and his argument that all and only undominated strategies are potentially utility maximising [-@Pearce1984], so it's perhaps not surprising it ends by advancing his approach to games and decisions.] This direction would push the theory closer to the approach of Robert @Stalnaker1998. But SCP doesn't require going this way; it is consistent with much stronger solution concepts.

The second way the theories could be in common follows from the failures of **Simplified Î²**. Solution concepts in game theory do not normally provide values for the possible options, or preference orderings over the unchosen options. They just say that some options are choice-worthy, and some are not. It is often presupposed in philosophical decision theory that the aim of the theory is to provide an (ideal) preference ordering over Chooser's options. I suspect we're best off rejecting that presupposition, and instead holding that the aim of decision theory is to describe the ideal choice-function.

My third suggestion for future directions of decision theory might sound somewhat defeatist. I think we should be sceptical of the prospects of developing a full theory of rational choice, and instead the aim of the theory should be to articulate substantive constraints, like SCP, on rational choice. 

One way to think about this is that it parallels the move in epistemology of moving away from analyses of knowledge, and towards other kinds of questions about the nature of knowledge. We can ask whether knowledge must be safe, without thinking that a positive answer suggests we endorse a safety-theoretic analysis of knowledge.

A closer analogy is the history over the 'refinements' literature in game theory.^[See @Govindan2008 for a helpful survey of this literatre.] The attempts to add conditions to Nash equilibrium to find a single complete theory of rational choice does not seem to have been a striking success. But if you look at that literature as an attempt to learn more about the nature of rational choice, it does have at least some incremental successes.

The aim of this paper is this latter kind of success. I'm not putting forward a full theory of rational choice, and I'm not close to having one. It might well be that rational choice is no more suspectible of analysis than knowledge is. But in both cases we can say substantive things, like that SCP is true.

The fourth way decision theory can learn from game theory, then, is by looking at the kinds of examples that have led to progress in game theory, and seeing what decision theorists can learn from them. There are many different approaches to signaling games^[Like the 'beer-quiche' game in @ChoKreps1987] which are compatible with SCP, and thinking through those games^[Or their decision theoretic equivalents, taking one of the players, probably Receiver, to be Demon.] could help discover more constraints on a theory of rational choice.

But you might wonder why we need to look at anything so fancy as signaling games to make progress. Couldn't we just look at Matching Pennies? Or, as decision theorists know it, Death in Damascus [@GibbardHarper1978]? What should Chooser do in @tbl-mean-demon?

|          | **PU** | **PD** |
|---------:|:------:|:------:|
| **Up**   |   1    |   11   |
| **Down** |   10   |   0    |

: An asymmetric version of Death in Damascus. {#tbl-mean-demon}

There are four natural options here.

One option is to say that Up is clearly better than Down. A number of theorists who disagree about many other things have endorsed this conclusion, e.g., @Richter1984, @Gallow2020, and @Spencer2021b. I can't take this approach because a simple variant of the argument in @sec-general-ratify shows this is incompatible with SCP.

A second option is to say that both options are choice-worthy. I don't know any compelling arguments against this option, but I also don't know anyone who endorses it, and it's probably not promising.^[Though note that both options are rationalizable, so the view that both are choice-worthy should not be dismissed.]

A third option is to say the case is a dilemma. Whatever Chooser does, they will immediately regret, and Chooser cannot rationally choose something they will immediately regret. We know that there are decision-theoretic dilemmas when Chooser has infinitely many choices^[E.g., Chooser can select any positive integer *n*, and gets a payout worth *n*.]; why shouldn't there be finite dilemmas? This view is also not popular with decision theorists, though again I've never seen a compelling argument against it. In particular, I've never seen a compelling case that allowing dilemmas in finite cases is more philosophically problematic than allowing them in infinite cases.

But the fourth option is the one that decision theorists who have endorsed SCP-friendly theories have typically taken. Chooser should play a mixed strategy. In particular, when ratificationist decision theories were more popular in the 1980s^[See @Skyrms1990b [sec. 7] for a helpful bibliography of 1980s work on ratificationism], this was the way most of them analysed @tbl-mean-demon.

There is a familiar response to this, most clearly expressed by @Arntzenius2008.^[@Icard2021 traces this kind of objection back to @Reichenbach1949.] He is considering the view that in cases like @tbl-mean-demon, one should hand over one's decision to a chance device.

> \[W]e are hardly ever in a situation in which we can perform such actions [i.e., use a chance device]. (It is not as if one has such a chance device stored away in some convenient part of one's brain.) [@Arntzenius2008 292]

As @Wallace2010 points out, the parenthetical is beside the point. It doesn't matter what we have stored away, but what the ideal chooser has stored away. We don't have a zero-cost matrix-inverter stored away either, but the ideal version of Chooser does.

So I'm inclined to agree with Wallace's conclusion, and this is the fifth way decision theory could be more like game theory.

> - _Ideal_ rational agents must be able to perform mixed acts with
any probability, because ideal rational agents must be diachronically consistent, and this requires access to mixed acts.  
> - Real agents, who actually can decide to pick an option at random, can approximate ideal rational agents at least reasonably well. [@Wallace2010 265-6, emphasis in original]

Defending these claims would require a paper probably as long as this one, and I'll leave it for another day. I'll simply note that, as often in philosophy, a big part of defending these claims will be clarifying what they mean. Here there are two big ambiguities that need resolving.

One is 'mixed strategy'. There are as many interpretations of that as there are interpretations of probability [@sep-probability-interpret]. The dispute I just cited between Arntzenius and Wallace actually turns out not to be about whether mixed strategies are available, but under what interpretation they are available.

The other ambiguous term here is 'ideal'. Getting clear on this might be more pressing. Is the ideal Chooser a standard for evaluation, as in ideal observer theory, or a tool for simplifying explanations, as in ideal gas theory? Wallace's second bullet point suggests he is thinking of the second kind of ideal, and if he is I'm inclined to agree that's what we should be focusing on. Sorting out this question requires a very deep dive into what the purpose of doing decision theory is, and might be necessary before saying what the ideal Chooser can and can't do.

So while the Single Choice Principle resolves several questions in decision theory, as we saw from sections [-@sec-buchak] to [-@sec-dynamic], it leaves many open. Indeed, it raises (or re-raises) some hard questions about the nature of decision theoretic ideals. So this paper is not one of those attempts to have the last word, by putting forward a universal theory of decision. It is, hopefully, a helpful first word, showing where such a theory is (and is not) most likely to be found.
