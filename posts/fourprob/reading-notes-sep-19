# Skyrms 1982 (J Phil)

"Causal Decision Theory"
Original version of deliberation dynamics
What to decide is sensitive to initial conditions (violating other principles)
Original version of Nice Demon (though only does symmetric version)

# Harper 1984 (1984 PSA - on JSTOR)

"Ratifiability and Causal Decision Theory: Comments on Eells and Seidenfeld"
Weirich cites this as Harper 1985, but JSTOR says 1984
Has the maximising version of ratifiability
Notes that mixed strategies solve some problems for ratifiability

# Skryms 1984 

Book - Pragmatics and Empiricism
Introduces "Shell Game", where the only ratifiable pure strategy looks like a bad option
Pages 84-86

# Weirich 1988

"Hierarchical Maximization of Two Kinds of Expected Utility"
Philosophy of Science
Also endorses maximising ratifiability
Lots of useful citations
Gives the asymmetric version of Nice Demon (567) - credits to Skyrms, but the asymmetry is novel, and that's what matters for us
On page 563 basically makes Spencer's argument against Gallow, but says that since Gallow's conclusion is obviously right, the argument must be faulty

# Sobel 1983

"Expected Utility and Maximal Choice"
Theoria
Online version seems messed up
AFAIK, argues that rational choice requires both ratifiability and maximality, so Newcomb is a dilemma. Still, should go in the camp of maximising

# Harper 1986 

We have this one of course
But somehow I'd missed that it is also a maximising ratifiability view
Should list it as such
