# Problem 1: Risk-Sensitivity {#sec-buchak}

Think about what value of *x* would make Chooser indifferent between these two options, and why that would be the right value:

1. \$1,000,000
2. A gamble that returns \$2,000,000 with probability *x*, and \$0 with probability 1-*x*.
 
What factors are relevant to solving for *x*? One factor is the declining marginal utility of money. Money primarily has exchange value, and if Chooser won $2,000,000, Chooser would exchange the second million for things they chose not to exchange the first million for, so the second million has less value. That's one reason that *x* is well above ½.

But is it the only reason? The orthodox answer is that it is. Lara @BuchakRisk has argued that it is not. We also need to know how much Chooser values, or more likely disvalues, risk. That is, we need to know how risk-seeking, or risk-averse, Chooser is.

The orthodox view is that all we need to know are three numbers. In what follows, let *b* be Chooser's current wealth in millions, and V the function from wealth (in millions), to utility. Since V is only determined up to positive affine transformations, we can stipulate two of these values for V.

- V(*b*), stipulated to be 0.
- V(*b* + 1), stipulated to be 1.
- V(*b* + 2), which we'll label *c*.

On the standard view, the gamble's value is *cx*, so Chooser is indifferent between it and the money iff *x* = 1/*c*. On Buchak's view, rational Chooser has a risk function *f*, that measures their sensitivity to risk. The function must be monotonic increasing, with *f*(0) = 0, and *f*(1) = 1. If Chooser is risk-averse, then typically *f*(*x*) < *x*. Buchak's view reduces to the orthodox view if *f*(*x*) = *x*. I'm going to argue that given SCP, *f*(*x*) does equal *x*. I'm far from the first to argue for *f*(*x*) = *x*.^[See @Briggs2015 and @Thoma2019 for different arguments to the same conclusion.] What's novel here is drawing this conclusion from just SCP.

The core of Buchak's theory is a non-standard way of valuing a gamble. For simplicity, we'll focus on gambles with finitely many outcomes. Associate a gamble with a random variable *O*, which takes values *o*~1~, …, *o~n~*, where *o~j~* > *o~i~* iff *j* > *i*. Buchak says that the risk-weighted expected utility of *O* is given by this formula, where *f* is the agent's risk-weighting function.

> REU(*O*) = *o*~1~ + $\sum_{i = 2}^n$ *f*(Pr(*O* ⩾ *o~i~*))(*o~i~* - *o*~*i*-1~)

The decision rule then is simple: choose the gamble with the highest REU. The key notion here is the risk function *f*, which we introduced earlier. I'm going to show that if *f*(*x*) = *x*^2^, then we get a violation of SCP. I won't go through the details of how this generalises to all other values of *f* other than identity^[If *f* is the identity function, Buchak's way of valuing gambles just becomes orthodox expected utility theory.], but it should be easy enough to see how to use the recipe here to find a problem for any other value of *f*.

As is standard, I'll assume that random moves in a game are made by a player called Nature. Chooser is always assumed to know the moves available to Nature at a node, and the probability that it will make any given move having arrived at that node.

In @fig-buchak at stage 1 a fair die will be rolled. If it lands 1 or 2, Nature moves Left; if it lands 3 or 4, Nature moves Middle; otherwise, Nature moves Right. If Nature moves Left, the game ends, and Chooser gets 1. Otherwise Chooser is told that Nature did not move Left, but not whether they moved Middle or Right. If Chooser selects Down, they get 1. If Chooser selects Up, they get 5 if Nature moved Middle, and 0 otherwise.

Two strategy tables for @fig-buchak.
:::

In @tbl-buchak-early, the REU of Down is 1 (since that's the only possible outcome), and the REU of Up is 8/9. There is a 2/3 chance of getting at least 1, so that's worth 4/9, and there's a 1/3 chance of getting another 4, so that's also worth 4/9, and adding those gives 8/9. So the optimal strategy, according to REU theory, is Down. That is, REU says to prefer the strategy _Choose Down if you have to choose_ to the strategy _Choose Up if you have to choose_. But if we get to the choice point, we're at @tbl-buchak-late. And in that table the REU of Up is 5 times 1/4, i.e., 5/4. So at that point, REU says to choose Up. What REU says to do if you have to choose is different to which strategy it chooses for the one and only point you have to choose at. That is, Buchak's theory violates the SCP, and so should be rejected.
