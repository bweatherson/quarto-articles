# From SCP to Ratifiability {#sec-ratify}

In this section I generalise the main result of the previous section, showing that (with one more assumption), that in any two option decision problem with two equilibria, both options are choiceworthy.^[Thanks to Dmitri Gallow for extensive suggestions which simplified and strengthened the proof that follows.]

It will help to relabel @tbl-generic-demon.
