Decision theory has become too disjointed. Problems that should be discussed together have spawned separate literatures. This paper aims to put the parts back together.

One principle, what I'll call the Single Choice Principle, tightly constrains the solutions to four separate kinds of problems in decision theory. These are: how to model rational risk aversion; how to incorporate evidential connections between options and states; whether probabilities, values, or options can be non-linear; and, how to relate synchronic and dynamic choice. In each case, once we accept the Single Choice Principle, only a narrow range of views are left as viable. By seeing the connections between these four questions, we also see how to answer them.

# The Single Choice Princple {#sec-scp}

The Single Choice Principle, hereafter SCP, concerns the relationship between strategic and dynamic versions of a special class of decision problem. It's easiest to illustrate the principle with some examples.

Chooser, who will be our paradigm decider, needs to eat dinner. They don't have food at home, so they'll have to eat out. In normal situations, this involves making two choices in succession. First, they decide where to eat, then when they get there they choose what to eat from the menu. Say they make the first decision at *t*~1~, and the second at *t*~2~.

Normally these decisions are not made at once, though the first is made with the second in mind. Also normally, Chooser will have more information at *t*~2~ than at *t*~1~. Chooser hasn't memorised the menu at every restaurant in town, and they certainly haven't called every restaurant to find out what's unavailable that day. Still, Chooser's imperfect beliefs about the options at *t*~2~ are relevant to what's rational to choose at *t*~1~.

Say a **strategy** for Chooser is a full set of instructions about what to do for the evening. A Strategy says what to do at *t*~1~, and for any possible thing Chooser could learn before *t*~2~, it says what to do in light of that information.

On a normal night, Chooser will pick a restaurant *r*, learn some information *e* (what's on the menu, what's not available^[In standard game-theoretic treatments of dynamic choice, *e* also includes what Chooser did, which is not assumed to be what they chose. The possibility of performance errors, where someone doesn't carry out their own strategy and subsequently has to adjust, is important for many purposes, but beyond the scope of this paper.]), and pick some food *f*. 

They could have chosen a strategy, which in this case is a pair of a restaurant, and a function from evidence to food.^[For another analogy, choosing a strategy is like programming a chess computer. It is a plan for what to do in any eventuality that is envisaged.] The choice of a strategy is a synchronic choice, and, if Chooser makes such a choice, it is subejct to the norms of synchronic choice. Normal Chooser makes two choices at different times, and their choices are subject to the norms of dynamic choice.

One big question is whether these two norms differ. A strongly negative answer says that they do not differ at all; in fact the two choice situations are equivalent.

Strategic-Dynamic Equivalence
:    Chooser's choices of *r* and, after learning *e*, of *f*, is rational iff the pair (*r*, if *e* then *f*) is part of a strategy Chooser could have rationally chosen.

The full version of **Strategic-Dynamic Equivalence** universally quantifies not just over *r*, *e* and *f*, but over all dynamic choice situations Chooser might find themselves in.

**Strategic-Dynamic-Equivalence** is
