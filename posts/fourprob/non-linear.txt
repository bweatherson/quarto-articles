# Question 3: Incompleteness {#sec-incompleteness}

Standard, textbook, approaches to decision theory assume that agents have numerical probabilities for each possible state, and numerical values for each possible outcome. The use of numbers here is not a trivial assumption; the real numbers have many distinct characteristics. Among other things, they are linearly ordered. In other words, the comparative relation between them is *complete*. If *x* and *y* are numbers, then either *x* is larger, or *y* is larger, or they are equal. Probabilities and values are only numerically representatable if for any two of them, either they are equal, or one is larger.

For both probabilities and values, this completeness assumption has been questioned. @Keynes1921 argued at length against probabilities being complete. He argued probabilities must be non-numerical because sometimes there are distinct probabilities where neither is greater than the other. Ruth @Chang2002 argued that some options are 'on a par' in terms of value, and this is a state distinct from equality (or either being better).

In this section I'll discuss a kind of non-linearity that hasn't received as much philosophical attention. Even if probabilities and values (of outcomes) are complete, preferences over options need not be complete. Indeed, SCP implies that there will be some incompleteness, at least if Demon is possible.

This is not a completely novel result. @EellsHarper1991 prove something similar given the assumption that the choice-worthy options are the ratifiable ones. SCP doesn't entail this version of ratificationism, but I think you can probably recover the consequences of ratificationism that Eells and Harper use as premises in their argument. I won't do that however; it's easier to argue directly from SCP to incompleteness.

One immediate question is just how to state incompleteness. If what it means for two options to be equally good just is that neither is strictly preferred to the other, then completeness follows immediately from the asymmetry of strict preference. We need some other way to understand what it is for options to be equally preferred.

One suggestion comes from Chang. She notes that if two options are equally good, then adding a small 'sweetener' to one of them should make the sweetened option better. If there are two options such that neither is strictly preferred to the other, and even after sweetening one, neither is strictly preferred to the other, then completeness fails.

Another suggestion comes from an approach to decision theory that traces back to @Samuelson1938. Some theorists have been sceptical of the very notion of preferences over options. 

Originally the motivation for this scepticism was somewhat behaviourist. If I have fifteen options, there is no behavioural difference between having *x* as my tenth best option and *y* as my eleventh, or vice versa. I won't choose either option either way.

What makes a behavioural difference is which options I take to be choice-worthy out of a set of options. We represent this by saying that when X is a set of options, c(X) is the set of choice-worthy options; they are the ones that I might (assuming I'm rational) pick.

These days behaviourist motivations are not given much weight, and rightly so. But there are other reasons to centre decision theory around choice functions rather than preference relations. As @Sen1971 shows, this formulation allows us to easily represent various options that are a bit more awkward to represent if we take preference as the central bit of ideology in our theory.

Now one might think that moving from preference to choice-theory won't help characterise incompleteness. In fact, it may make things worse. It's natural to think that if c({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*}, then *x* is preferred to *y*, if c({*x*, *y*}) = {*y*}, then *y* is preferred to *x*, and if c({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*, *y*}, then each option is equally good. We'll set aside whether the first two claims are right, and note one reason to be suspicious of the third.

If *x* and *y* are equally preferred, then in any larger set of options that contains them both, either both should be choice-worthy or neither one should be. Saying one is choice-worthy but not the other violates the idea that they are equally good. Sen's Principle β is a generalisation of this idea; we'll work with the simpler version.

Simplified β
:    If c({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*, *y*}, then for any *z*: *x* ∈ c({*x*, *y*, *z*}) iff *y* ∈ c({*x*, *y*, *z*}).

Given **Simplified β**, it is plausible to equate c({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*, *y*} with *x* and *y* are equally good. But if **Simplified β** fails, then it is more plausible that preferences at this point are incomplete. Indeed, given some weak (but not quite trivial) assumptions about c, we can prove that completeness is equivalent to **Simplified β**.^[For a careful statement of what those assumptions are, see @Sen1971 or @Kreps1988.]

I just gave two ways of testing for incompleteness, but they end up being very closely related. Assume c({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*, *y*}, and let *z* be a small sweetening of *x*. Perhaps it is *x* plus a dollar. Then if sweetening does not destroy the parity between *x* and *y*, we'll have c({*x*, *y*, *z*}) = {*y*, *z*}, violating **Simplified β**.
