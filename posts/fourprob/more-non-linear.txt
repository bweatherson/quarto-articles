# Consequences of Incompleteness

This conclusion of @sec-incompleteness is relevant to the arguments that Keynes, Chang, and others have made. Keynes, especially in the _General Theory_ [@Keynes1936], was interested in situations where intuitively all of the following are true.

1. The farm is not worth more than £1,000,000.
2. The farm is not worth less than £1,000,000.
3. The farm is not worth exactly £1,000,000.

One way to argue for 3 is the small improvements argument; if the farm is worth exactly £1,000,000, then an afternoon of slightly better than expected weather should break the tie. But that's not how we value farms.

One way to argue for 1 and 2 is that decisions to trade, i.e., to buy or sell the farm for £1,000,000, seem to rely on 'animal spirits'; it isn't like anyone thinks that selling the farm for £1,000,000 is a great deal, or that buying it for £1,000,000 is a bargain. This is a very simplified summary of Keynes's reasoning, but let's stick with it for now.

As @DorrEtAl2023 [sec. 5] point out, this is a pretty weak argument. At most, what this shows is that the farm is not _definitely_ worth more or _definitely_ worth less than £1,000,000. But it could be that the value of the farm is vague, where this still means it is more than, less than, or equal to £1,000,000. They suggest that all the cases where completeness intuitively fails are like this; none of the comparative claims is definitely true, but one is actually true.^[They also have a direct argument for comparability turning on some intuitions about negated comparison claims. It would take us very far afield to go over that carefully, but the argument from SCP for incomparability is relevant here too. The cost of giving up the semantic intuitions they rely on seems, to me at least, much less than the cost of giving up the Ramsey test for conditionals. And the Ramsey test is enough to motivate SCP. This may be a case where the different semantic intuitions are inconsistent, in which case we have to see which intuition is least costly to abandon. Working that out in full is a task for another paper, but I doubt the answer is that it's best to abandon the Ramsey test.]

Whether that diagnosis of the intuitions that Keynes, Chang, and others put forward is right, it won't help explain what's going on in the case here. In @tbl-nice-demon-linear, all of the following are true.

1. Up is not better (for Chooser) than Down. If it were, Down would not be choice-worthy.
2. Down is not better (for Chooser) than Up. If it were, Up would not be choice-worthy.
3. Up and Down are not equally good (for Chooser). If they were, they would still be equally good when a third option was added, which is inconsistent with the fact that Up but not Down is choice-worthy in @tbl-nice-demon-safe.

The arguments from SCP don't just show 1-3 are true; they show that 1-3 are definitely true. So this attempt to explain away intuitions opposing completeness doesn't fully generalise.

Another set of worries about completeness failures comes from thinking about dynamic choice. Adam @Elga2010 and Johan @Gustafsson2022 have developed versions of this worry. In both cases their arguments are a bit more subtle than the one I'll present here, but the extra subtleties don't affect the reply I'll offer, so I'll stick to a simple argument.

Assume that **Simplified β** fails for some options *x*, *y*, and *z*. And assume that Chooser will be offered the decision problem shown in @fig-beta.

      \node[hollow node,label=above:{Chooser}]{}
        child { node {\emph{z}}}
        child { node [solid node, label=right:{Chooser}]{}
            child {
                node {\emph{x}}
            }
            child {
                node {\emph{y}}
            }
            };
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Here's an argument that if **Simplified β** ever fails, Chooser can rationally do something that's clearly irrational.

1. It's rational for Chooser to go right at the top node, since *x* ∈ c(\{*x*, *y*, *z*\}).
2. If Chooser goes right, it's then rational for Chooser to again go right, since *y* ∈ c(\{*x*, *y*\}).
3. If it's rational to go right at the top node, and rational having done that to go right at the middle node, it's rational to go right at each node.
4. So it's rational for Chooser to go right at each node, choosing *y* from \{*x*, *y*, *z*\}, contradicting *y* ∉ c(\{*x*, *y*, *z*\}).

I'm going to reject premise 2 of this argument. What *y* ∈ c(\{*x*, *y*\}) shows is that choosing *y* at the middle node would be rational if only forward-looking considerations were relevant to rational choice. What we should reject is that only forward-looking considerations are relevant to rational choice. 

The right way to think about @fig-beta is that Chooser should adopt a strategy, then carry it out, provided they do not have a reason to abandon the strategy. The only strategy that could lead them to go right is a strategy of choosing *x*, and they never get a reason to abandon that strategy, and it would be irrational to abandon a strategy they have no reason to abandon, so they cannot rationally choose *y*.

In the next section I'll defend this view of dynamic choice at more length.
