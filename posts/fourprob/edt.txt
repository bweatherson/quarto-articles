# Problem 2: Demons and Multiple Equilibria {#sec-multiple}

This section is about problems like Newcomb's Problem [@Nozick1969]. I'm not going to start with Newcomb's Problem itself; I would end up replaying familiar lines if I started there. Instead I'll start with a very generic form of similar problems.

@tbl-generic-demon is (the strategic form of) a completely generic form of a 2-by-2 decision problem involving demons. At stage 2, Chooser will pick Up or Down. At stage 1, Demon will predict what Chooser will do. I'll only discuss cases where Demon is (believed to be) arbitrarily close to perfect in their predictions. 

|           |       PU     |     PD       |
|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|  **Up**   |     *a*      |     *b*      |
|  **Down** |     *c*      |     *d*      |

: A generic demon problem {#tbl-generic-demon}

Say that an option is a strict equilibrium if, assuming Demon predicts correctly, Chooser's payout for choosing it is (strictly) greater than their payout for choosing any other option. So Up is a strict equilibrium if *a* > *c*. The focus in this section is going to be on problems where both Ip and Down are strict equilibria, so *a* > *c*, and *d* > *b*. While Newcomb's Problem itself is not such a case, most of the views that have been proposed to deal with Newcomb's Problem have consequences for the case where both Up and Down are strict equilibria, and they typically say things that violate SCP.

To simplify matters, I'm going to make two further assumptions which are widely, but not universally, shared. First, I'll assume that the names of the options are irrelevant. In particular, I'll assume that if Up is rationally permissible in @tbl-generic-demon, then Down is permissible in @tbl-inverted-generic.

|           |       PU     |     PD       |
|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|  **Up**   |     *d*      |     *c*      |
|  **Down** |     *b*      |     *a*      |

: @tbl-generic-demon with labels inverted {#tbl-inverted-generic}

Second, I'll assume that the values in the table settle which options are rational. This assumption is denied by theorists such as @Skyrms1982 and @Joyce2012, who say that in problems like these, Chooser's starting view about what option they will eventually select also makes a difference to what they should do. Those views are not subject to the objections I'm about to make––provided Chooser's credences satisfy some rather tight constraints.

I'm going to largely focus on versions of @tbl-generic-demon where *a* and *d* are positive, and *b* = *c* = 0. This kind of problem is called Nice Demon by @Skyrms1982 and @Weirich1988, and is shown in @tbl-nice-demon. I'm going to mostly discuss the case, discussed by Weirich but not Skyrms, where *a* ≠ *d*. The main conclusion is that given SCP, both Up and Down are permissible in these cases.

|           |       PU     |     PD       |
|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|  **Up**   |     *a*      |     0      |
|  **Down** |     0      |     *d*      |

: Nice demon {#tbl-nice-demon}

There is a quick argument, independent of SCP, for the same conclusion. Whatever values *a* and *d* are, it's permissible for Chooser to be arbitrarily confident that they will play Up. Given that confidence, Chooser should think that Up maximises expected utility. It's permissible to choose an option that maximises expected utility given permissible credences. Therefore Up is rationally permissible. Since Up was arbitrary in this argument, it is also permissible to choose Down, so both are permissible.

Weirich [-@Weirich1988 563] makes a version of this argument, and then says that since the conclusion is obviously false, something must be wrong with it. He thinks that Chooser should not be allowed to use credences about their own future actions in the way the argument presupposes. This allows him to say, along with many others, that if *d* > *a*, then only Down is rationally permissible. I'm not going to rely on this argument, but simply note that it doesn't seem like a bad argument to me, and in any case I will be endorsing its conclusion.^[@Spencer2023 makes a related argument in the course of defending the permissibility of both options.]

There are three interesting families of views which differ markedly with each other in general, but which agree that in @tbl-nice-demon, whichever of *a* and *d* is larger determines which option is uniquely choiceworthy.

The first family of views is just a single, famous, view: Evidential Decision Theory. It says that in any version of @tbl-generic-demon, if *a* ≠ *d*, then whichever is larger should be chosen. Hence it says that in @tbl-nice-demon, the larger value should be chosen.

The second family of views are what @EellsHarper1991 call Maximum Ratifiability views. They say that when there are multiple ratifiable options, the value with the highest expected utility should be chosen. Such views differ on what to do when there are no ratifiable options, which is why I'm calling this a family of views. But they all agree on @tbl-nice-demon. Maximum Ratifiability is defended by @Jeffrey1983, @Sobel1983, @Harper1984, @Weirich1988, @Arntzenius2008, and @Gustafsson2011.

The third family of views say that in any version of @tbl-generic-demon, one should minimise possible regret. That is, one should choose Up if the possible Regret from choosing Up, *d* - *b*, is less than the possible regret from choosing Down, *a* - *c*. @Wedgwood2013a, @Gallow2020, @Podgorski2022, and @Barnett2022 endorse such a view, though they go on to say very different things about cases with three or more options. These views also say that in @tbl-nice-demon, whichever of *a* and *d* is larger determines the uniquely choiceworthy option.

All of these views violate SCP.

The focus of this section is only problems where both Up and Down are strict equilibria. In particular, focus on problems that satisfy these three constraints.

1. *a* > *c*, and *d* > *b*.
2. *a* > *d*.
3. *b* > *c*.

The first says that Up and Down are both strict equilibria. The second says that Up has the highest payout among the equilibria. The third says that Up has a higher off-equilibrium payout than Down does. Many theorists who disagree about other questions in decision theory say that these three facts suffice to make Up uniquely choice-worthy.

Evidential Decision Theorists say that 2 alone suffices for choosing Up over Down.

Consider next the theory that says only equilibria are choice-worthy, and among equilibria, one should choose the equilibrium with the highest expected payout. Versions of this theory are endorsed by @Jeffrey1983b, @Arntzenius2008, and @Gustafsson2011. Given 1 and 2, this theory says to choose up.

Finally, consider the theory that says one should (in two options games) minimise possible regret. That is, one should choose Up if the possible Regret from choosing Up, *d* - *b*, is less than the possible regret from choosing Down, *a* - *c*. @Wedgwood2013a, @Gallow2020, @Podgorski2022, and @Barnett2022 endorse this claim, though they go on to say very different things about cases with three or more options. Given constraints 2 and 3, these theories also say to choose Up.

I'll argue that in any such problem, both Up and Down are choice-worthy. I'm not the first to say this. Jack @Spencer2021b and Melissa @Fuscond also say that both equilibria are choice-worthy.^[Fusco and Spencer disagree on a lot of other questions, and I think the SCP tends to favour Fusco's side of their disagreement, but it would be a huge digression to sort out those details.] This implies that in any problem where Up and Down are both strict equilibria, they are both choice-worthy, since there is nothing more that could make Up uniquely choice-worthy. Just what is the relationship between being an equilibrium and being choice-worthy is a question for another day, but in 2*2 games, they pick out the same options.

Consider the dynamic game shown in @fig-edt.

The payouts on the right are taken from @tbl-generic-demon, and the payout if the game exits without a choice is half way between the two payouts if Demon predicts Down. I've left the probability of exit if Demon predicts Up as a variable *p*. The decision tables for the one choice in the dynamic game, and the strategic choice for the whole game, are in @tbl-edt.

Payout tables for @fig-edt.
:::

If *p* is large enough, then in @tbl-edt-early, the bottom-right will be larger than the top-left, and the bottom-left will be larger than the top-right. So if constraints 1-3 are sufficient conditions for one option to be uniquely choice-worthy, then if *p* is large enough, Down will be uniquely choice-worthy in @tbl-edt-early. But Up is uniquely choice-worthy in @tbl-edt-late, so this will violate the SCP.

How large does *p* have to be? As long as *p* > (2*a* ‑ 2*d*)/(2*a* ‑ *b* ‑ *d*), then the bottom-left will be greater than the top-right. This is consistent with *p* < 1, since *d* > *b*. As long as *p* > (2*b* ‑ 2*c*)/(*b* + *d* ‑2*c*), then the bottom-right will be greater than the top-left. Again, since *d* > *b*, this is consistent with *p* < 1. We can guarantee both conditions are met if:

$$
p = 1 - \frac{(d-b)^2}{(2a-b-d)(b+d-2c)}
$$

Assume we use the values from @tbl-sample-violation-late, so *a* = 72, *b* = 36, *c* = 18, and *d* = 54. Then this formula says that *p* = 1/9. If we set *p* to 1/9, we get the tree shown in  @fig-sample-violation. What I've argued here is that that example is perfectly general. If constraints 1-3 suffice for Up being uniquely choice-worthy, then any game where there are two equilibria but Up is uniquely choice-worthy can be embedded in a dynamic game where it is the game Chooser will face if they ever have to choose, but in the strategic form of the game, Down is uniquely choice-worthy. So saying 1-3 suffices for Up being uniquely choice-worthy leads to systematic violations of the SCP. Since the SCP is true, these theories must be false.

If constraints 2 and 3 don't suffice to say that a particular strict equilibrium in a 2*2 game is not choice-worthy, it's hard to see what further constraints could make a difference. So I conclude that, if the SCP is true, then in 2*2 games with two strict equilibria, both options are choice-worthy. This shows that @Spencer2021b and @Fuscond are right about these problems.

That's a case where a theorist who thinks constraints 1-3 suffice for Up being uniquely choice-worthy will violate the SCP. As we noted at the start of this section, many theories do say those constraints suffice for unique choice-worthiness, so they are all wrong.

In a 2*2 game with multiple strict equilibria, the only theory that's compatible with the SCP, and hence the only plausible theory, is that both equilibria are choice-worthy.
