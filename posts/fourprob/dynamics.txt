# Problem 4: Dynamics {#sec-dynamics}

Start with a detour into introductory game theory. Chooser is playing a game with Guy; Chooser will select the row, and Guy will (simultaneously) select the column. The payouts from their choices are shown in @tbl-chooser-guy, with Chooser's payout first in each cell.

|       |   Left    |    Right    |
|------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Up    |   6,1     |    0,0      |
| Down  |   0,0     |    4,1      |

: A simple coordination game. {#tbl-chooser-guy}

Textbook approaches to this game say that it has two 'solutions': (Up, Left) and (Down, Right). A natural way to understand 'solutions' is that either Up or Down could be rational for Chooser.

Now imagine that Chooser has a prior choice. They can either accept a payout of 5 (and Guy will get nothing), or gamble and play @tbl-chooser-guy. The dynamic problem Chooser now faces is shown in @fig-chooser-guy-two, and the strategy table for that problem is shown in @tbl-chooser-guy-two.

[Insert figure]

|               |   Left    |    Right    |
|--------------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Exit-Up       |    5,0    |    5,0      |
| Exit-Down     |    5,0    |    5,0      |
| Gamble-Up     |   6,1     |    0,0      |
| Gamble-Down   |   0,0     |    4,1      |

: The strategic form of @fig-chooser-guy-two. {#tbl-chooser-guy-two}

The textbook approaches to this game are that the top three strategies are choice-worthy, they are all part of both strategic and dynamic equilibria, and the bottom strategy is not choice-worthy.

This might already seem surprising. The textbook approach says that:

1. It is rational for Chooser to play Gamble.
2. If Chooser was playing @tbl-chooser-guy without any prior moves, it would be rational to play Down.
3. But, in @fig-chooser-guy-two, it is not rational to play Gamble followed by Down.

The notion of choice-worthiness here is not purely forward-looking. It is not rational to play Down after playing Gamble because that combination is irrational, in fact strictly dominated, even though Down is consistent with purely forward looking considerations that bear on what's rational.

But while the textbook notion of rationality is not purely forward looking, it is not purely strategic either. It is not rational to reject any offer in @fig-ultimatum, the simplified Ultimatum game, even though the strategy AR is part of an equilibrium.

The core idea, which goes back to @Selten1974, is that rational play in games must be both dynamically and strategically rational. For a strategy in a dynamic game to be part of an equilibrium, it must be rationally permissible to choose that strategy in the strategic form of the game, and every move must be rational when it is made given purely forward looking considerations. The first conjunct rules out Gamble-Down in @fig-chooser-guy two; the second conjunct rules out AR in @fig-ultimatum.

I propose that we take the same approach to dynamic choice in single player decision problems. Replace Guy in the above examples with Demon, and say that Demon will play Left if they predict Up, Right if they predict Down, and we get an interesting problem for SCP. According to SCP, in the version of @fig-chooser-guy-two where Demon is involved, 1-3 above are still all true.

This looks like a problem. Indeed, it is basically a version of the problem that Elga raises for incomplete probabilities, and Gustafsson raises for incomplete values. The solution is simply to say that rational players are not purely forward-looking; they adopt rational strategies, and they do things that are rational independent of what they have previously done.

I call this view of dynamic choice the **Dual Mandate** theory, since it requires Chooser to be rational according to both forward-looking and strategic considerations. The idea behind it isn't new; @Selten1974 was outlining a similar view in game theory half a century ago. But it hasn't been discussed much in the philosophy literature. @Gustafsson2022 [73] calls a similar view the _Conservative Approach_, and notes it is discussed by @Rabinowicz1995; that might be the closest thing to a precusor in philosophy.

The Dual Mandate theory isn't entailed by SCP, but it is closely related to it. 

Without Dual Mandate, the version of ratificationism that SCP implies would say something implausible. If we said only forward-looking considerations were relevant, we'd implausibly say that Gamble-Down was rational in @fig-chooser-guy-two. If we said that only strategic considerations were relevant, we'd implausibly say that rejecting offers could be rational in @fig-ultimatum. (Or we'd have to hope that weak dominance considerations would take care of all cases like @fig-ultimatum.) With Dual Mandate, the ratificationist can say sensible things about both cases.

In the other direction, without SCP, Dual Mandate would be fairly implausible. If preferences were complete whenever probabilities and values were complete, as most theories that reject SCP say, then there would be too many dilemmas. For instance, if you combine Dual Mandate with Evidential Decision Theory, or with Maximum Ratificationism, then @fig-ultimatum is a dilemma. One must play AR on strategic grounds, and AA on dynamic grounds, so one cannot do everything one must do. I don't think we should think there are never dilemmas, but it would be surprising if they were so frequent.

Dual Mandate says that Chooser can adopt the plan Gamble-Up in @fig-chooser-guy-two, but once they adopt that plan, they have to stick to it. And they have to stick to it even though, once they reach the second stage, it would be consistent with forward looking considerations to switch. Gustafsson objects (to a very similar view) on the following grounds.

> But, if you don't prefer following the plan to deviating from it, then it's hard to see what would be irrational about choosing to deviate. [@Gustafsson2022 73]

This is a good challenge, but there are (at least) two interesting replies to it.^[There is a connection between this challenge and the debate about whether intentions, as Michael @Bratman1987 understands them, can provide reasons. It would take us way too far afield to chase these down, but see @SetiyaSEP [ยง4] for a good summary of the debate.]

The first reply, following @Stalnaker1999, says that rational agents know what they are doing. When Chooser adopts the strategy Gamble-Up, they must, if they are rational, know that's what they will do. If they play Down at stage 2, then since their belief they would play Gamble-Down is false, it can't be knowledge. Hence they were not rational at the first step. So it isn't consistent with rationality throughout the game that they play Gamble-Down.

I think that reply is good, but in case not everyone does, I'll offer a second. This reply is based on arguments by Richard Holton [-@Holton2000; -@Holton2009], but I'm going to, somewhat anachronistically, spell it out using the inquiry-centric language popularised by Jane Friedman [-@Friedman2019; -@Friedman2020]. Start with the very familiar idea that being rational is about being reasons-responsive. Then make a key distinction, between reasons to open an inquiry, and reasons to close that inquiry in a particular way.

With that distinction in mind, here's a picture of dynamic choice. At the start of any dynamic decision problem, Chooser should adopt a strategy. It should be a strategy that makes strategic sense, i.e., the choice of strategy should be at least ratifiable, and it should be a strategy Chooser can carry out. From that point, Chooser should simply carry out the strategy unless they have reason to reconsider their choices. If the strategy is about to say _Do an irrational thing_, like recommending leaving money on the table, Chooser has a reason to reconsider the strategy. But unless the strategy recommends an irrational act, Chooser has no reason to reconsider it. It's irrational to do what one has no reason to do, so Chooser would be irrational to even open inquiry into the question _Should I keep following the strategy?_.

That's what would be irrational about 'choosing to deviate'. It's not the _deviate_ part that's irrational; it's the _choosing_. Chooser can only choose what to do at stage two of the decision problem by opening inquiry into the question _What should I do now?_. And that's precisely what they should not do, unless the strategy is leading them to an irrational act. Since Up is not irrational, they have no reason to even ask whether to keep following their strategy.

This approach (like the Stalnakerian approach) has the nice advantage that it does not recommend anything like AR in the Ultimatum game. Had Chooser adopted strategy AR, then Demon only offered \$1, they would have had a reason to reopen inquiry into whether to keep following their strategy. And they would have had a reason to conclude that they should not. That's very different to @fig-chooser-guy-two, where they have no reason to second guess Gamble-Up as a strategy.

The fact that Down is rational in @tbl-chooser-guy means that, if at stage two Chooser opened inquiry into the question of what they should do, it would be rational to conclude they should play Down. There would be nothing irrational in closing inquiry with the decision to play Down. But there would be something irrational in opening the inquiry; they had a plan, it was working well, they have no reason to even ask whether they should do anything different.

This picture, that people should make plans they won't regret, and stick to them unless they are going awry (which they won't if they were well chosen), fits well with the Dual Mandate. If one does not take reasons to (re)open inquiry as a distinctive kind of reason, and especially if one thinks opening inquiry into what to do does not require reasons, then it is harder to answer Gustafsson's challenge. But inquiry is an action, and requires reasons, and one natural view about what those reasons should be suffices to defend Dual Mandate.
