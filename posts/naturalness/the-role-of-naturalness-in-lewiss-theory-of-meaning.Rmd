title: "The Role of Naturalness in Lewis's Theory of Meaning"
description: |
 Many writers have held that in his later work, David Lewis adopted a theory of predicate meaning such that the meaning of a predicate is the most natural property that is (mostly) consistent with the way the predicate is used. That orthodox interpretation is shared by both supporters and critics of Lewis's theory of meaning, but it has recently been strongly criticised by Wolfgang Schwarz. In this paper, I accept many of Schwarz's criticisms of the orthodox interpretation, and add some more. But I also argue that the orthodox interpretation has a grain of truth in it, and seeing that helps us appreciate the strength of Lewis's late theory of meaning.

It is sometimes claimed (e.g., by @Sider2001-SIDCOP
[@Sider4D; @Stalnaker2004-JACLOI-2; @Williams2007; @Weatherson2003-WEAWGA])
that David Lewis's theory of predicate meaning assigns a central role to
naturalness.[^2] Some of the people who claim this also say that the
theory they attribute to Lewis is true. The authors I have mentioned
aren't as explicit as each other about exactly which theory they are
attributing to Lewis, but the rough intuitive idea is that the meaning
of a predicate is the most natural property that is more-or-less
consistent with the usage of the predicate. Call this kind of
interpretation the 'orthodox' interpretation of Lewis.[^3] Recently
Wolfgang Schwarz [-@Schwarz2009 209ff] has argued that the orthodox
interpretation is a misinterpretation, and actually naturalness plays a
much smaller role in Lewis's theory of meaning than is standardly
assumed.[^4] Simplifying a lot, one key strand in Schwarz's
interpretation is that naturalness plays no role in the theory of
meaning in @Lewis1969a [@Lewis1975b], since Lewis hadn't formulated the
concept yet, and Lewis didn't abandon that theory of meaning, since he
never announced he was abandoning it, so naturalness doesn't play
anything like the role orthodoxy assigns to it.

In this article I attempt to steer a middle ground between these two
positions. I'm going to defend the following parcel of theses. These are
all exegetical claims, but I'm also interested in defending most of the
theses that I ultimately attribute to Lewis, so getting clear on just
what Lewis meant is of more than historical interest.

1.  Naturalness matters to Lewis's (post-1983) theory of sentence
    meaning only insofar as it matters to his theory of rationality, and
    the theory of rationality matters to the (pre- and post-1983) theory
    of meaning.

2.  Naturalness might play a slightly larger role in Lewis's theory of
    word meaning, but it isn't nearly as significant as the orthodox
    view suggests.

3.  When we work through Lewis's theory of word and sentence meaning, we
    see that the orthodox interpretation assigns to Lewis a theory that
    isn't his theory of meaning, but is by his lights a useful
    heuristic.

4.  An even better heuristic than 'meaning = use plus naturalness' would
    be 'meaning = predication plus naturalness', but even this would be
    a fallible heuristic, not a theory.

5.  When correctly interpreted, Lewis's theory is invulnerable to the
    challenges put forward in @Williams2007.

I'm going to start by saying a little about the many roles naturalness
plays in Lewis's philosophy, and about his big picture views on thought
and meaning. Then I'll offer a number of arguments against the orthodox
interpretation of Lewis's theory of sentence meaning. After that, I'll
turn to Lewis's theory of word meaning, where it is harder to be quite
clear about just what the theory is, and how much it might have changed
once natural properties were added to the metaphysics. An appendix
discusses some interpretative questions that arise if we are sceptical
that any one division of properties can do all the work that Lewis has
the natural/non-natural division do.

### How Naturalness Enters The Theory of Meaning

Most of the core elements of David Lewis's philosophy were present, at
least in outline, from his earliest work. The big exception is the
theory of natural properties introduced in @Lewis1983e. As he says in
that paper, he had previously believed that "set theory applied to
possibilia is all the theory of properties that anyone could ever need"
[@Lewis1983e 377n]. Once he introduces this new concept of naturalness,
Lewis puts it to all sorts of work throughout his philosophy. I'm rather
sceptical that there is any one feature of properties that can do all
the varied jobs Lewis wants naturalness to do, but the grounds for, and
consequences of, this scepticism are a little orthogonal to the main
theme of this paper, so I've set it aside.

As the orthodox interpretation stresses, Lewis has naturalness do some
work in this theory of content. That he does think there's a connection
between naturalness and content is undeniable from the most casual
reading of his post-1983 work. But just how they are connected is less
obvious. To spell out these connections, let's start with three Lewisian
themes.

-   Facts about linguistic meaning are to be explained in terms of facts
    about minds. In particular, to speak a language $\mathcal{L}$ is to
    have a convention of being truthful and trusting in $\mathcal{L}$
    [@Lewis1969a; @Lewis1975b]. And to have such a convention is a
    matter of having certain beliefs and desires. So mental content is
    considerably prior to linguistic content in a Lewisian theory.
    Moreover, Lewis's theory of linguistic content is, in the first
    instance, a theory of *sentence* meaning, not a theory of *word*
    meaning. [^5]

-   The principle of charity plays a central role in Lewis's theory of
    mental content @Lewis1974c [@Lewis1994b]. To a first approximation,
    a creature believes that $p$ iff the best interpretation of the
    creature's behavioural dispositions includes the attribution of the
    belief that $p$ to the creature. And, ceteris paribus, it is better
    to interpret a creature so that it is more rather than less
    rational. It will be pretty important for what follows that Lewis
    adopts a principle of charity that highlights *rationality*, not
    *truth*. It is also important to Lewis that we don't just interpret
    the individual creature, but creatures of a kind [@Lewis1980c]. I'm
    not going to focus on the social externalist features of Lewis's
    theory of mental states, but I think they assist the broader story I
    want to tell.

-   Lewis's theory of mental content has it that mental contents are
    (what most of us would call) properties, not (what most of us would
    call) propositions [@Lewis1979b]. So a theory of natural properties
    can easily play a role in the theory of mental content, since mental
    contents are properties. If you think mental contents are
    propositions, the connection between naturalness and mental content
    will be more indirect. Just how indirect it is will depend on what
    your theory of propositions is. But if mental contents are Lewisian
    propositions, the connection may be very indirect indeed. After all,
    propositions that we might pick out with sentences containing words
    that denote very unnatural properties, such as *All emeroses are
    gred*, might be intuitively very natural.

Now let's see why we might end up with naturalness in the theory of
meaning. An agent has certain dispositions. For instance, after seeing a
bunch of green emeralds, and no non-green emeralds, in a large and
diverse range of environments, she has a disposition to say "All
emeralds are green". In virtue of what is she speaking a language in
which "green" means green, and not grue? (Note that when *I* use "grue",
I mean a property that only differs from greenness among objects which
it is easy to tell that neither our agent, nor any of her interlocutors,
could possibly be acquainted with at the time she makes the utterance in
question.)

Let's say that $\mathcal{L}_1$ is English, i.e., a language in which
"green" means green, and $\mathcal{L}_2$ a language which is similar to
$\mathcal{L}_1$ except that "green" means grue. Our question is, what
makes it the case that the agent is speaking $\mathcal{L}_1$ and not
$\mathcal{L}_2$? That is, what makes it the case that the agent has
adopted the convention of being truthful and trusting in
$\mathcal{L}_1$, and not the convention or being truthful and trusting
in $\mathcal{L}_2$?

We assumed that the agent has seen a lot of emeralds which are both
green and grue. To a first approximation, it is more charitable to
attribute to the agent the belief that all emeralds are green than the
belief that all emeralds are grue because greenness is more natural than
gruesomeness. As Lewis says, "The principles of charity will impute a
bias towards believing things are green rather than grue" [-@Lewis1983e
375]. And for Lewis, charity requires imputing more reasonable
interpretations. But why is it more charitable to attribute beliefs
about greenness to beliefs about grueness? I think it is because we need
more evidence to rationally form a belief that some class of things are
all grue than we need to form a belief that everything in that class is
green. And that's because, ceteris paribus, we need more evidence to
rationally form a belief that all $F$s are $G$s than that all $F$s are
$H$s when $G$ is less natural than $H$. The agent has, we might assume,
sufficient evidence to rationally believe that all emeralds are green,
but not sufficient evidence to believe that all emeralds are grue.

So the first two Lewisian themes notes above, the reduction of
linguistic meaning to mental content, and the centrality of a
rationality-based principle of charity, push us towards thinking that
naturalness is closely connected to mental content and hence to
linguistic meaning. And it has pushed us towards thinking that if
naturalness is connected to meaning, it is via this connection I've
posited between naturalness and rational belief. Note that Lewis doesn't
ever endorse anything like that general a connection, but I suspect he
had something like this in mind when he wrote the sentence I quoted in
the previous paragraph. We'll come back to this interpretative question
at some length below.

But the argument I offered was a bit quick, because I ignored the third
Lewisian theme: beliefs are relations to properties, not propositions.
On Lewis's theory, to believe that all emeralds are green is to
self-ascribe the property of being in a world where all emeralds are
green. So if a certain body of evidence makes it possible for the agent
to rationally believe that all emeralds are green, but not for her to
believe that all emeralds are grue, and that's because rationality is
constitutively connected to naturalness, then that must be because the
first of the following properties is more natural than the second:

-   Being in a world where all emeralds are green

-   Being in a world where all emeralds are grue

That could still be true, though it is notable how far removed we are
from the intuitions that motivate the distinctions between more and less
natural properties. It's not like there is some sense, intuitively, in
which things that have the first property form a more unified class than
things that have the second property.

So it's plausible that naturalness is connected to mental content, at
least as long as naturalness is connected to rational belief. And since
mental content is connected to linguistic content, we're now in the
vicinity of the orthodox interpretation. But I don't think the orthodox
interpretation can be right. I'll give four reasons for this, starting
with the textual evidence for and against it.

### Textual Evidence about Sentence Meaning

There is some *prima facie* textual evidence for the orthodox
interpretation. But looking more careful at the context of these texts
not just undermines the support the text gives to the orthodox
interpretation, but actually tells against it. (This part of the paper
is indebted even more than the rest to Wolfgang Schwarz's work, and
could be easily skipped by those familiar with that work.)

I'll focus on the last seven pages of "New Work for a Theory of
Universals". This is the part of "New Work" that uses the notion of
naturalness, as introduced in the paper, to respond to Putnam's
model-theoretic arguments for massive indeterminacy of meaning. Lewis
actually responds to Putnam twice over. First, he responds to Putnam
directly, by showing how adding naturalness to a use-based theory of
sentence meaning avoids the 'just more theory' objection that's central
to Putnam's argument. And when Lewis describes this direct response, he
says things that sound a lot like the orthodox interpretation.

> I would instead propose that the saving constraint concerns the
> referent - not the referrer, and not the causal channels between the
> two. It takes two to make a reference, and we will not find the

> thought when we refer, but in part it consists in eligibility of the
> referent. And this eligibility to be referred to is a matter of
> natural properties. [@Lewis1983e 371]

But after this direct response is finished, Lewis notes that he has
conceded quite a lot to Putnam in making the response.

> You might well protest that Putnam's problem is misconceived,
> wherefore no need has been demonstrated for resources to solve it. ...
> Where are the communicative intentions and the mutual expectations

> for saving constraints, there will still be a remedy analogous to
> Merrill's suggested answer to Putnam, and there will still be a need
> for natural properties. [@Lewis1983e 373]

I noted earlier that Schwarz makes much of a similar passage in
"Putnam's Paradox", and I think he is right to do so. Here's a crucial
quote from that paper.

> I shall acquiesce in Putnam's linguistic turn: I shall discuss the
> semantic interpretation of language rather than the assignment of
> content to attitudes, thus ignoring the possibility that the latter
> settles the former. It would be better, I think, to start with the
> attitudes and go on to language. But I think that would relocate,
> rather than avoid, the problem; wherefore I may as well discuss it on
> Putnam's own terms. [@Lewis1984b 222]

That passage ends with a footnote where he says the final section of
"New Work" contains a version of how the 'relocated' problem would be
solved. So let's turn back to that. The following long portmanteau quote
from pages 373 to 375 captures, I think, the heart of my interpretation.

> The problem of assigning content to functionally characterised states
> is to be solved by means of constraining principles. Foremost among

> my emphasis]

I think that does a reasonably clear job of supporting the
interpretation I set out in the introduction over the orthodox
interpretation. Naturalness matters to linguistic meaning all right. But
the chain of influence is very long and indirect. Naturalness constrains
what is reasonable, reasonableness constrains charitable
interpretations, charitable interpretations constrain mental content,
and mental content constrains linguistic content. Without naturalness at
the first step, we get excessive indeterminacy of content. With it, the
Putnamian problems are solved. But there's no reason to think
naturalness has any more direct role to play at any level in the theory
of linguistic content.

In short, Lewis changed what he thought about rationality when he
adopted the theory of natural properties. Since rationality was a part
of his theory of mental content, and mental content determines
linguistic content, this change had downstream consequences for what he
said about linguistic content. But there wasn't any other way his theory
of linguistic content changed, nor, contra orthodoxy, any direct link
between naturalness and predicate meaning.

Moreover, when we look at the closest thing to a worked example in
@Lewis1983e, we don't get any motivation for the orthodox
interpretation. Here's the example he uses, which concerns mental
content. Let $f$ be any mapping from worlds to worlds such that the
agent has the same evidence and behaviour in $w$ and $f(w)$. Extend $f$
to a mapping from sets of worlds to sets of worlds in the following
(standard) way: $f(S) = \{f(w): w \in S\}$. Then the agent's behaviour
will be rationalised by her evidence just as much if she has credence
function $C$ and value function $V$, as if she has credence function
$C^\prime$ and value function $V^\prime$, where $C^\prime(f(S)) = C(S)$,
and $V^\prime(f(S)) = V(S)$. To relate this back to the familiar
Goodmanian puzzle, let $f$ map any world where all emeralds are green to
nearest world where all emeralds are grue, and vice versa, and map any
other world to itself. Then the above argument will say that the agent's
behaviour is rationalised by her evidence just as much as if her
credences are $C$ as if they are $C^\prime$. That is, her behaviour is
rationalised by her evidence just as much if she gives very high
credence to all emeralds being green as to all emeralds being grue. So
understanding charity merely as rationalizing behaviour leaves us
without a way to say that the agent believes unobserved emeralds are
green and not grue.

Lewis's solution is to say that charity requires more than that. In
particular, it requires that we assign natural rather than unnatural
beliefs to agents where that is possible. I've argued above that this
makes perfect sense if we connect naturalness with rationality. The
crucial thing to note here is that this all happens a long time before
we can set out the way that a sentence is used, since the way a sentence
is used on Lewis's theory of linguistic content includes the beliefs
that are formed on hearing it. So the discussion in "New Work" suggests
that naturalness matters for content, but not in a way that can be
easily factorised out. And that's exactly what I think is the best way
to understand Lewis's theory.

### Textual Evidence and Naturalness and Rationality

A major part of my argument above was that naturalness affected Lewis's
theory of rationality. In particular, once he had naturalness to work
with, he seemed to think that it was more rational to project natural
rather than unnatural properties. The textual evidence for this is, I'll
admit, fragmentary. But it is fairly widespread. Let's start with a
quote we've already seen.

> The principles of charity will impute a bias toward believing that
> things are green rather than grue [@Lewis1983e 375]

As noted above, I assume this isn't a special feature of green and grue,
but rather that there is a general principle in favour of projecting
natural properties. But it would be good to have more evidence for that.

Lewis returns to the example of the believer in grue emeralds a few
times. Here is one version of the story in *Plurality*.

> We think that some sorts of belief and desire $\dots$ would be
> unreasonable in a strong sense $\dots$ utterly unintelligible and
> nonsensical. Think of the man who, for no special reason, expects
> unexamined emeralds to be grue. $\dots$ What makes the perversely
> twisted assignment of content incorrect, however well it fits the
> subject's behaviour, is exactly that it assigns ineligible,
> unreasonable content when a more eligible assignment would have fit
> behaviour equally well. [@Lewis1986a 38-9]

And a little later, when replying to Kaplan's paradox, he says,

> Given a fitting assignment, we can scramble it into an equally fitting
> but perverse alternative assignment. Therefore a theory of content
> needs a second part: as well as principles of fit, we need 'principles
> of humanity', which create a presumption in favour of some sorts of
> content and against others. [@Lewis1986a 107]

He returns to this point again in "Reduction of Mind".

> [Folk psychology] sets presumptive limits on what our contents of
> belief and desire can be. Self-ascribed properties may be 'far from
> fundamental', I said -- but not *too* far. Especially gruesome
> gerrymanders are *prima facie* ineligible to be contents of belief and
> desire. In short, folk psychology says that we make sense. It credits
> us with a modicum of rationality in our acting, believing and
> desiring. [@Lewis1994b 320 in reprint]

The running thread through these last three quotes is that our theory of
mental content rules out gruesome assignments, and it does this because
assigning rationality is constitutive of correctly interpreting. This
can only work if naturalness is connected to rationality. I've
attributed a stronger claim to Lewis, that not only is naturalness
connected to rationality, but that the connection goes through
projection.[^6]

One piece of evidence for that is that Lewis says, in "Meaning Without
Use" that Kripkenstein's challenge was "formerly Goodman's challenge"
[@Lewis1992a 109]. He goes on to say that the solution to this challenge
(or should that be 'these challenges') involves "carrying more baggage
of primitive distinctions or ontological commitments than some of us
might have hoped" [@Lewis1992a 110]. A footnote on that sentence cites
"New Work", in case it isn't obvious that the baggage here is the
distinction between natural and unnatural properties. So somehow, Lewis
thinks that natural properties help solve Goodman's puzzle. I think that
the simplest such solution is the right one to attribute to Lewis;
natural properties are *prima facie* more eligible to be projected.

A referee noted that this passage is a little odd; it appears to simply
conflate a meta-semantical paradox with an epistemological paradox. But
I think that just shows how much, for Lewis, meta-semantical questions
are epistemological questions. Words get their meanings in virtue of our
conventions. Our conventions consist of our beliefs and desires. And
facts about rationality are, in part, constitutive of what we believe
and desire.

Finally, consider the way in which the papers on natural properties are
introduced in *Papers in Metaphysics and Epistemology*. Lewis says that
"I had been persuaded by Goodman and others that all properties were
equal: it was hopeless to try to distinguish 'natural' properties from
gruesomely gerrymandered, disjunctive properties." [@Lewis1999a 1-2] A
footnote refers to *Fact, Fiction and Forecast*. Of course, the point of
"New Work" is that Lewis abandons this, explicitly Goodmanian, view. Now
that he had learned property egalitarianism from Goodman of course
doesn't show that once he became a property inegalitarian, he applied
this to Goodman's own paradox. But it does seem striking that the only
citation of an egalitarian view is of *Fact, Fiction and Forecast*. I
take that to be some, inconclusive, evidence that Lewis did indeed think
natural properties were related to Goodman's paradox.

Ultimately, it seems the textual evidence is this. There are many
different occasions where Lewis makes clear there is a connection
between naturalness and rationality, and in particular, between
naturalness and the kind of rationality that is relevant to content
assignment. There are hints that this connection goes via naturalness
playing a role in solving Goodman's paradox. Notably, there is no other
obvious way in which naturalness could connect to rationality. At least,
I can neither think of another connection, nor see any evidence for
another connection in the Lewis corpus. So I conclude, a little
tentatively, that Lewis thought natural properties had a role to play in
solving Goodman's paradox.

### Word Meaning and Naturalness

In "Languages and Language", Lewis doesn't say that human linguistic
practices merely determine truth conditions for the spoken sentences.
That is, our linguistic practices don't merely determine which
**language**, in Lewis's sense, we speak. They also determine, to some
extent, a **grammar**, which specifies the truth conditional
contribution of the various parts of the sentence. The grammar
determines the "fine structure of meaning" [@Lewis1975b 177] of a
sentence or phrase.

In comments on an earlier draft of this paper, an anonymous referee
stressed that naturalness could enter directly into a theory of meaning
once we stopped focussing on sentence meaning, and started looking on
word meaning. I don't mean to say the referee was endorsing any
particular role for naturalness in the theory of word meaning. But the
point that we need to say more about the Lewisian approach to word
meaning before we conclude that naturalness is only indirectly related
to meaning is right. And I'm grateful for the encouragement to discuss
it further.

Lewis has a short discussion of grammars in "Languages and Language",
and another in "Radical Interpretation". It's worth looking at both of
these in turn. I'll take "Languages and Language" first, since even
though it has a slightly later publication date, in the respects we're
discussing here it closely resembles the theory in *Convention*.

On pages 177-8 of that paper, Lewis notes three ways in which there may
be indeterminacy in the grammar.

1.  A subject's behavioural dispositions and anatomy might
    underdetermine their beliefs and desires.

2.  The beliefs and desires might underdetermine the truth conditions of
    their language.

3.  The truth conditions of the language might underdetermine the
    meanings of the individual words.

While Lewis does not think the second is actually a source of
indeterminacy, he does think that the third is.

> My present discussion has been directed at the middle step $\dots$ I
> have said $\dots$ that the beliefs and desires of the subject and his
> fellows are such as to comprise a fully determinate convention of
> truthfulness and trust in some definite language. $\dots$ I am
> inclined to share in Quine's doubts about the determinacy of the third
> step. [@Lewis1975b 178]

Lewis gives reasons for this inclination a few paragraphs earlier. He
says that while we can say what it is for a community to speak one
language rather than another, we can't say what it is for a community to
speak one grammar rather than another. He says that we don't have any
objective measures for evaluating grammars. And he says Quine's examples
of indeterminacy of reference show that languages can have multiple good
grammars, even if these disagree radically about the meaning of some
constituents.

Notably, Lewis doesn't take to show that there is anything wrong with
the notion of word meaning. He says it would be "absurd" (177) to
conclude that. His conclusion here is more one of modesty rather than
philosophical scepticism. We don't know how to extend the theory of
sentence meaning he offers to a theory of word meaning, so we should do
what we can without talking about word meaning.

The approach in "Radical Interpretation" has a bit more of a hint for
how to restore semantic determinacy. The subject matter of that paper is
how to solve for the mental and linguistic contents of a speaker, called
Karl, given the physical facts about them. Lewis uses **M** for "a
specification, in our language, of the meanings of expressions of Karl's
language." [@Lewis1974c 333] He lists a number of constraints on a
solution, including early versions of his principles of constitutive
rationality. But the most notable constraint, from our perspective, is
this:

> *The Principle of Generativity* constrains **M**: **M** should assign
> truth conditions to the sentences of Karl's language in a way that is
> at least finitely specifiable, and preferably also reasonably uniform
> and simple. [@Lewis1974c 339]

There's something very odd about this. Lewis, in 1974, didn't have a
theory of what made an assignment simple. He needed his theory of
natural properties to do that. Or, at least, once he had the theory of
natural properties, it did all the work he ever wanted out of an account
of simplicity.

Be that as it may, it does suggest that Lewis did think that simplicity
of assignments could be used as a way of cutting down the third kind of
semantic indeterminacy discussed in "Languages and Language". He doesn't
think it would generate a fully determinate interpretation of Karl's
language.

> It seems hopeless to deny, in the face of such examples as those in

> and semantic apparatus. [@Lewis1974c 342-3]

It's notable that some of the examples Quine gives in "Ontological
Relativity" are not cases where the alternative meanings are by any
measure equally natural. This positive allusion to Quine's examples
suggests a link to this comment in "Languages and Language"

Note that he doesn't say 'equally' good. And note also how this
contrasts with the attitude he takes towards the prospects of
indeterminacy in sentence meaning. I earlier quoted him saying that part
of the point of "Languages and Language" was to show how the second type
of indeterminacy didn't arise. He ends "Radical Interpretation" with
this 'credo'.

So that's where things stood before 1983. Lewis thought he had a theory
that eliminated, or at least minimised, indeterminacy at the level of
truth conditions. But he didn't think his theory eliminated
indeterminacy, even quite radical indeterminacy, in word meanings. And
he didn't seem bothered by this aspect of the theory; indeed, he thought
Quine's arguments showed that we shouldn't eliminate this kind of
indeterminacy.

This attitude towards Quinean arguments for indeterminacy is obviously a
striking contrast to the forcefulness, and rapidity, with which he
responded to Putnam's arguments for indeterminacy. That shouldn't be too
surprising once we attend to Lewis's threefold distinction between kinds
of indeterminacy. Quine was arguing that indeterminacy of the third kind
was rampant. Putnam was arguing that indeterminacy of the second kind
was rampant. And, as Lewis announced in "Radical Interpretation", he
wasn't going to believe any such argument.

Still, we might wonder whether the resources he brought to bear in
responding to Putnam also help respond to Quine. Or, perhaps more
importantly for exegetical reasons, we might wonder whether Lewis
thought they were useful in responding to Quine. The evidence from "New
Work" seems to suggest a negative answer to the latter question. Lewis
never says that one of the things you can do with the distinction
between natural and unnatural properties is respond to arguments for
Quinean indeterminacy. And that's despite the fact that "New Work" has a
very survey-like feel; the bulk of the paper is a long list of
philosophical work that a theory of universals can do.

In "Putnam's Paradox" there is a brief footnote on Quine's arguments for
indeterminacy. It reads

> It is not clear how much indeterminacy might be expected to remain.
> For instance, what of Quine's famous example? His rabbit-stages,
> undetached rabbit parts, and rabbit-fusion seem only a little, if any,
> less eligible than rabbits themselves. [@Lewis1984b 228n]

As I've stressed repeatedly, following Schwarz, taking the disclaimers
at the start of "Putnam's Paradox" seriously means that we have to be
careful in interpreting what Lewis says about how words acquire
determinate meaning in that paper. But even before we adjust for the
disclaimers, this is hardly a ringing rejection of Quine's indeterminacy
arguments. The contrast to Lewis's attitude towards Putnam's arguments
is striking. Since it is the very same contrast that we saw in both
"Languages and Language" and "Radical Interpretation", I think it is
fair to assume that he continued to think Quine's arguments were
considerably stronger than Putnam's.

But there is, perhaps, a change of view in "Meaning Without Use". Here's
the problem Lewis addresses at the end of that paper. Let
$\mathcal{L}_1$ once again be English as we currently understand it, and
let $\mathcal{L}_3$ be just like English, except that it doesn't assign
any truth conditions to sentences over a thousand words long.[^7] Do our
actual linguistic practices manifest a convention of trust in
$\mathcal{L}_1$, or trust in $\mathcal{L}_3$? Lewis argues that it is
more like a convention of trust in $\mathcal{L}_3$. If someone utters a
very long sentence, we expect some kind of performance error, at best.
We don't, in general, believe what they say. So the theory of "Languages
and Language" seems to predict that these long sentences have no truth
conditions. But that's wrong, so the theory must be corrected.

Lewis's correction appeals, it seems, to natural properties in fixing a
grammar. He says that linguistic practice determines truth conditions
for a fragment of the language that is widely used. Those truth
conditions determine meanings of words. This determination requires
natural properties; without them the Quinean problems multiply
indefinitely. We then use those word meanings to determine the meaning
of unused sentences. A long footnote suggests that the procedure might
not be restricted to unused sentences. As long as there is a large
enough fragment in which there are conventions of truthfulness and
trust, we can extrapolate from that to other parts of the language that
are used.

This is a marked deviation from anything Lewis had said until then. From
the earliest writings, he had stressed a step-by-step approach to
content determination. Behavioural dispositions plus physical and
biological constraints determine mental content; mental content
determines sentence meaning; and sentence meaning determines word
meaning. In "Meaning Without Use", it seemed the last two steps were
being somewhat merged.

But we shouldn't overstate how much the third step was allowed to
encroach on the second. Lewis does think we need to rule out 'bent'
grammars, which don't assign any truth conditions to sentences over a
thousand words long, or which give sentences different meanings to what
we'd expect if the word 'cabbage' appears forty times. But he doesn't
think we need to rule out any 'straight' grammar, which includes "any
grammar that any linguist would actually propose." [@Lewis1992a 109]

So Lewis's focus here is to rule out unnatural *compositional rules*,
not unnatural assignments of content to individual words. The reference
to linguists here might be useful. Linguists tend to spend much more
time on compositional rules than they do on the contents on individual
predicates. Notably, Quine didn't argue for indeterminacy by positing
indeterminacy in the compositional rules of the language; his
non-standard interpretations all share a standard syntax. If we posit
that Lewis thought that there was little syntactic indeterminacy in the
language, like there is little indeterminacy at the level of truth
conditions of sentences, we can tell a story that doesn't involve too
many unsignalled changes of view. Here's how I would tell that story in
some more detail.

Lewis's early view, expressed clearly in "Radical Interpretation" and
"Languages and Language", and not retracted before, I think, 1992, has
the following parts:

1.  Conventions of truthfulness and trust determine (very sharply) truth
    conditions for sentences in a speaker's language.

2.  Any reasonably good grammar, i.e., assignment of word meanings and
    compositional rules, that is consistent with the truth conditions is
    not determinately wrong. There is potentially substantial
    indeterminacy in the meaning of any given word, because there are
    many reasonably good grammars consistent with the truth conditions.

After 1983, 'simplicity' was understood in terms of naturalness, but
otherwise the story doesn't change a lot.

The later view, which goes by somewhat more quickly in "Meaning Without
Use", has the following parts:

1.  Conventions of truthfulness and trust in (the bulk of) the used
    fragment of the language determine truth conditions for that
    fragment.

2.  Naturalness considerations determine the compositional rules for the
    language by extrapolation from that grammar.

3.  Word meanings are determined, so far as they are determinate, by the
    truth conditions for sentences, plus the compositional rules.

4.  Truth conditions for sentences outside the used fragment are
    determined by the word meanings and the compositional rules.

Neither of these views look much like the orthodox view. Remember that
the orthodox view has it that considerations of naturalness can be used
to resolve debates in metaphysics. That's certainly the use that
@Sider2001-SIDCOP makes of the orthodox view. But on the early view,
simplicity considerations only come in after the truth conditions for
every sentence have been determined, and hence so that all debates are
settled. And on the later view, simplicity considerations primarily are
used to settle truth conditions for unused, or at least unusual,
sentences.

Now if you thought the salient fragment in point 1 of the later view was
small, and if you thought naturalness had a major role to play in step 3
of the later view, you would get back to something like the orthodox
view. But I don't see the textual evidence for either of those
positions. Lewis says that "the used fragment is large and varied."
[@Lewis1992a 110] It doesn't look like he is positing wholesale changes
to his view on the determination of truth conditions. He is positing
some changes; the last two pages of the paper are clearly marked as
deviations from his earlier position. But both the examples he uses and
the rhetoric around them suggests that the bulk of the changes happen at
point 2. Naturalness considerations constraint the syntax of a language
much more tightly than they constrain the assignment of meaning to a
given word. In sum, at no point in the evolution of his views did Lewis
seem to endorse the orthodox interpretation, even as a theory of word
meaning.

### An Argument for the Orthodox Interpretation

So far I've argued that there is no solid textual support for the
orthodox interpretation. My rival interpretation relied on there being a
connection between naturalness and induction, and as we've just seen,
there is some textual evidence for this. But perhaps there is a more
indirect way to motivate the orthodox interpretation of Lewis. The
orthodox interpretation attributes to Lewis a theory that is quite
attractive as a theory of semantic determinacy and indeterminacy. Call
that theory the **U&N Theory**, short for the **U**se plus
**N**aturalness theory of meaning. Since Lewis was clearly looking for
such a theory when he discussed naturalness in the context of his theory
of content, it is reasonably charitable to attribute the **U&N
Theory** to him, as the orthodox interpretation does.

My response to this will be in three parts. First, I'll argue in this
section that my rival interpretation attributes to Lewis a theory of
semantic determinacy and indeterminacy that does just as well at
capturing the facts Lewis wanted a theory to capture, so there's no
charity based reason to attribute the **U&N Theory** to him (And, as we
saw in the previous section, there's no direct textual reason to
attribute it to him either.) Second, the **U&N Theory** is subject to
the criticisms in @Williams2007, while the theory I attribute to Lewis
is not. Third, the **U** part of the **U&N Theory** is hopelessly vague;
it isn't clear how to say what 'use' is on a Lewisian theory that makes
it suitable to add to naturalness to deliver meanings. Either use is so
thick that naturalness is unneeded, or it is so thin that naturalness
won't be sufficient to set meaning. So actually it isn't particularly
charitable to attribute this theory to him.

Still, let's start with the attractions of the **U&N Theory**. On the
one hand, agents are inclined to say "All emeralds are green" both in
situations where they've seen a lot of green emeralds (and no non-green
ones) and in situations where they've seen a lot of grue emeralds (and
no non-grue ones). That's because, of course, those are exactly the same
situations. So at first glance, it doesn't look like the way in which
"green" is used will determine whether it means green or grue. On the
other hand, once we add a requirement that terms have a relatively
natural meaning, we do get this to fall out as a result. Moreover we can
even see how this falls out of a recognisably Lewisian approach to
meaning.

Consider again our agent who says "All emeralds are green" after seeing
a lot of emeralds that are both green and grue. And remember that for
her to speak a language, she must typically conform to conventions of
truthfulness and trust in that language. Now if the agent was speaking
$\mathcal{L}_2$, she would have to think that she's doing an OK job of
being truthful in $\mathcal{L}_2$ by saying "All emeralds are green".
But that would be crazy. Why should she think that all emeralds are grue
given her evidence base? To attribute to her that belief would be to
gratuitously attribute irrational beliefs to her. And on Lewis's
picture, gratuitous attributions of irrationality are false. So the
agent doesn't have that belief. So she's not speaking $\mathcal{L}_2$.

Things are even clearer from the perspective of hearers. A hearer of
"All emeralds are green" would be completely crazy to come to believe
that all emeralds are grue. The hearer knows, after all, that the
speaker has no acquaintance with the emeralds that would have to be blue
for all emeralds to be grue. So the hearer knows that this utterance
could not be sufficient evidence to believe that all emeralds are grue.
Yet if she speaks $\mathcal{L}_2$, she is disposed to believe that all
emeralds are grue on hearing "All emeralds are green". She isn't
irrational, or at least we shouldn't assign irrationality to her so
quickly, so she doesn't speak $\mathcal{L}_2$.

So it looks like in this one case at least, we have a case where use
plus naturalness gives us the right theory. Agents are disposed to use
"green" to describe emeralds that are green/grue. But the fact that
greenness is more natural than gruesomeness makes it more appropriate to
attribute to them a convention according to which "All emeralds are
green" means that all emeralds are green and not that all emeralds are
grue.

But more carefully, what we should say is that the **U&N Theory** gives
us the right result in this case. It doesn't follow that it will work in
all cases, or anything like it. And it doesn't follow that it works for
the right reasons. As we'll see, neither of those claims are true. In
fact, just re-reading the last three paragraphs should undermine the
second claim. Because we just saw a derivation that the agents are not
speaking $\mathcal{L}_2$, that didn't even appeal to the **U&N Theory**.
Rather, that derivation simply used the theory of meaning in
*Convention* and the theory of mental content in "Radical
Interpretation". It's true that the latter theory assigns a special role
to rationality, and the theory of rationality we used has, among other
things, a role for natural properties, but that is very different to the
idea that naturalness feeds directly into the theory of meaning in the
way the orthodox interpretation says. As I said at the start, I think
the best interpretation of Lewis is that he changed his theory of
*rationality* in 1983, but that's the only change to his theory of
*meaning*.

Put another way, these reflections on "green" and "grue" are consistent
with the view that the **U&N Theory** is a false *theory*, but a useful
*heuristic*. It's a useful heuristic because it agrees with the true
Lewisian theory in core cases, and is much easier to apply. That's
exactly what I think the **U&N Theory** is, both as a matter of fact,
and as a matter of Lewis interpretation.

### Indeterminacy and Radically Deviant Interpretations

If the **U&N Theory** is a heuristic not a theory, we should expect that
it will break down in extreme cases. That's exactly what we see in the
cases discussed in @Williams2007. Those cases highlight the fact that a
Lewisian theorist needs to be careful that we don't end up concluding
that normal people, such as the agent in our example who says "All
emeralds are green", speak $\mathcal{L}_4$. $\mathcal{L}_4$ is a
language in which all sentences express claims about a particular
mathematical model (essentially a Henkin model of the sentence the agent
accepts), and it is set up in such a way that ordinary English sentences
come out true, and about very natural parts of the model. On the **U&N
Theory**, it could easily turn out that ordinary speakers are speaking
$\mathcal{L}_4$, since the assigned meanings are so natural. We can see
this isn't a consequence of *Lewis's* theory by working through the case
from first principles. I have two arguments here, the first of them
relying on some slightly contentious claims about the epistemology of
mathematics, the second less contentious.

Assume, for reductio, that ordinary speakers are speaking
$\mathcal{L}_4$. So, for instance, when O'Leary says "The beer is in the
fridge", what he says is that a certain complicated mathematical model
has a certain property. (And indeed it has that property.) Now this
won't be a particularly rational thing for O'Leary to say unless he
knows more mathematics than ordinary folks like him ordinarily do. So if
O'Leary has adopted a convention of truthfulness and trust in
$\mathcal{L}_4$, then uttering "The beer is in the fridge" would be
irrational, even if he is standing in front of the open fridge, looking
at the beer. That's a gratuitous assignment of irrationality, and
gratuitous assignments of irrationality are false, so O'Leary doesn't
speak $\mathcal{L}_4$.

Perhaps that is too quick. After all, the mathematical claim that
$\mathcal{L}_4$ associates with "The beer is in the fridge" is a
necessary truth. And Lewis's theory of content is intentional, not
hyper-intentional. So O'Leary does know it is true. (And when he is
standing in front of the fridge, there's even a sense that he knows that
"The beer is in the fridge" expresses a truth, if $\mathcal{L}_4$ is
really his language.) I think that's probably not the right sense of
"rational", and I'm not altogether sure how much hostility to
hyper-intensionalism we should attribute to Lewis. But so as to avoid
these questions, it's easier to consider a different argument that
focusses attention on O'Leary's audience.

When O'Leary says "The beer is in the fridge", Daniels hears him, and
then walks to the fridge. Why does Daniels make such a walk? Well, he
wants beer, and believes it is in the fridge. That looks like a nice
rational explanation. But why does he believe the beer is in the fridge?
I say it's because he's (rationally) adopted a convention of
truthfulness and trust in $\mathcal{L}_1$, and so he rationally comes to
believe the beer is in the fridge when O'Leary says "The beer is in the
fridge". On the assumption that O'Leary and Daniels speak
$\mathcal{L}_4$, none of this story goes through. But we must have some
rational explanation of why O'Leary's statement makes Daniels walk to
the fridge. So O'Leary and Daniels must not be speaking $\mathcal{L}_4$.

Michael Morreau pointed out (when I presented this talk at CSMN) that
the preceding argument may be too quick. Perhaps there is a way of
rationalising Daniels's actions upon hearing O'Leary's words consistent
with the idea that they both speak $\mathcal{L}_4$. Perhaps, for
instance, Daniels's walking to the fridge constitutes saying something
in a complicated sign language, and that thing is the rational reply to
what O'Leary said. If this kind of response works, and I have no reason
to think it won't, the solution is to increase the costs to Daniels of
performing such a reply. For instance, not too long ago I heard Mayor
Bloomberg say "Lower Manhattan is being evacuated because of the
impending hurricane", and I (and my family) packed up and evacuated from
Lower Manhattan. Even if one could find an interpretation of our actions
in evacuating that made them constitute the assertion of a sensible
reply to Bloomberg's mathematical assertion in $\mathcal{L}_4$, it would
be irrational to think I made such an assertion. Evacuating ahead of a
storm with an infant is not fun - if it was that hard to make
mathematical assertions, I wouldn't make them! And I certainly wouldn't
make them in reply to someone who wouldn't even see my gestures. So I
think at least some of the actions that are rationalised by testimony,
interpreted as sentences of $\mathcal{L}_1$, are not rationalised by
testimony, interpreted as $\mathcal{L}_4$. By the kind of appeal to the
principle of charity we have used a lot already, that means that
$\mathcal{L}_4$ is not the language most people speak.

The central point here is that when we are ruling out particularly
deviant interpretations of some speakers, we have to make heavy use of
the requirement that the interpretation of their shared language
rationalises what they do. In part that means it must rationalise why
they utter the strings that they do in fact utter. And when we're
considering this, we should remember the role of naturalness in a theory
of rationality. But it also means that it must rationalise why people
respond to various strings with non-linguistic actions, such as walking
to the fridge, or evacuating Lower Manhattan. Naturalness has less of a
role to play here, but the Lewisian theory still gets the right answers
provided we apply it carefully. Since the Lewisian theory gets the right
answers, and the **U&N Theory** gets the wrong answers, it follows that
the **U&N Theory** isn't Lewis's theory, and so orthodoxy is wrong.

### What is the Use of a Predicate?

We concluded the last section with an argument that Lewis isn't
vulnerable to the claim that his theory assigns complicated mathematical
claims as the meanings of ordinary English sentences. That
interpretation, we argued, is inconsistent with the way those sentences
are used. In particular, it is inconsistent with the way that *hearers*
use sentences to guide their actions.

So far so good, we might think. But notice how much has been packed into
the notion of use to get us this far. In identifying the use O'Leary
makes of "The beer is in the fridge", we have to say a lot about
O'Leary's beliefs and desires. And in identifying the use Daniels makes
of it, we *primarily* talk about the sentence's effects on Daniels's
beliefs and desires. That is, just saying how the sentence is used
requires saying a lot about mental states of speakers. And that will
often require appealing to constitutive rationality; we say that
Daniels's beliefs about the fridge changed because we need to
rationalise his fridge-directed behaviour.

And this should all make us suspicious about the prospects for
identifying meaning (in a Lewisian theory) with use plus naturalness.
The argument above that naturalness mattered to meaning relied on the
idea that naturalness matters because it affects which states are
rational, and hence which states are actualised. A belief that all
emeralds are grue is unnatural, so it is hard to hold. And since it is
hard to hold, it is hard to think one is conforming to a convention of
truthfulness in a language if one utters sentences that mean, in that
language, that all emeralds are grue. That's why it is wrong, *ceteris
paribus,* to interpret people as speaking about grueness.

But now consider what happened when we were talking about Daniels and
O'Leary. Even to say how they were using the sentence "The beer is in
the fridge", we had to say what they believed before and after the
sentence was uttered. In other words, their mental states were
constitutive of the way the sentence was used. Now add in the extra
premise, argued for above, that naturalness matters to Lewis's theory of
linguistic content because, and only because, it matters to his theory
of mental content. (And it only matters to mental content because it
matters to the principle of charity that Lewis uses.) If mental states,
and their changes, are part of how the sentences are used, it will be
rather misleading to say that meaning is determined by use plus
naturalness. A better thing to say is that meaning is determined by use,
and that some key parts of use, i.e., mental states of speakers and
hearers, are determined in part by naturalness.

So I'm sceptical of the **U&N Theory**. We can put the argument of the
last few paragraphs as a dilemma. There are richer and thinner ways of
identifying the use to which a sentence is put. A thin way might, for
instance, just focus on the observable state of the part of the physical
world in which the sentence is uttered. A rich way might include
include, inter alia, the use that is made of the sentence in the
management of belief and the generation of rational action. If we adopt
the thin way of thinking about use, then adding naturalness won't be
enough to say what makes it the case that O'Leary and Daniels are
speaking $\mathcal{L}_1$ rather than $\mathcal{L}_4$. If we adopt the
rich way of thinking about use, then the role that naturalness plays in
the theory of meaning has been incorporated into the metaphysics of use.
Neither way makes the **U&N Theory** true while assigning naturalness an
independent role. This dilemma isn't just an argument that we shouldn't
attribute the **U&N Theory** to Lewis; it is an argument against anyone
adopting that theory.

### From Theory to Applied Semantics

So far we've argued that Lewis's semantic theory did not look a lot like
the orthodox interpretation. It's true that he thought the way a
sentence was used was of primary importance in determining its meaning.
And it's true that he thought naturalness mattered to meaning. But that
wasn't because naturalness came in to resolve the indeterminacy left in
a use-based theory of meaning. Rather, it was because naturalness was in
a part of the theory of mental content, and specifying the mental states
of speakers and hearers is part of specifying how the sentence is used.

But note that these considerations apply primarily to investigations at
a very high level of generality, such as when we're trying to solve the
problems described in "Radical Interpretation". They don't apply to
investigations into applied semantics. Let's say we are trying to figure
out what O'Leary and Daniels mean by "green". And assume that we are
taking for granted that they are speaking a language which is, in most
respects, like English. This is hardly unusual in ordinary work in
applied semantics. If we are writing a paper on the semantics of colour
terms, a paper like, say, "Naming the Colours", we don't concern
ourselves with the possibility that every sentence in the language
refers to some complicated mathematical claim or other.

Now given those assumptions, we can identify a moderately thin notion of
use. We know that O'Leary uses "green" to describe things that are, by
appearance, both green and grue. We also know that when O'Leary makes
such a description, Daniels expects the object will be both green and
grue. So focus on a notion of use such that the *use* of a predicate
just is a function of which objects speakers will typically apply the
predicate to, and which properties hearers take those objects to have
once they hear the predication. If we wanted to be more precise, we
could call this notion of 'use' simply *predication*. When we are doing
applied semantics, especially when we are trying to figure out the
meaning of predicates, we typically know which objects a speaker is
disposed to predicate a predicate of, and that's the salient feature of
use. (This is why I said the most accurate heuristic would be meaning is
predication plus naturalness; predication is the bit of use we care
about in this context.)

This identification of use wouldn't make any sense if we were engaged in
theorising at a much more abstract level. If we are doing radical
interpretation, then we have to take non-semantic inputs, and solve
simultaneously for the values of the subject term and the predicate term
in a (simple) sentence. But when we are just doing applied semantics,
and working just on the meaning of a term like "green" in a
well-functioning language, we can presuppose facts about the denotation
of the subject term in sentences like *S is green*, and presuppose facts
about what is the subject and what is the predicate in that sentence,
and then we can look at which properties hearers come to associate with
that very object on hearing that sentence.

Now that we have a notion of use that's distinct from naturalness, we
can ask whether it is plausible that predicate meaning is use (in that
sense) plus naturalness. And, quite plausibly, the answer is yes. The
arguments in @Sider2001-SIDCOP and @Weatherson2003-WEAWGA in favour of
this theory look like, at the very least, good arguments that the theory
does the right job in resolving Kripkensteinian problems. The theory is
immune to objections based on radical re-interpretations of the
language, as in @Williams2007, because those will be inconsistent with
the use so defined. And the theory fits nicely into Lewis's broader
theory of meaning, i.e., his metasemantics, which is in turn well
motivated. So I think there are good reasons to hold that when we're
doing applied semantics, the **U&N Theory** delivers the right verdicts,
and delivers them for Lewisian reasons. That's the heart of what's true
about the **U&N Theory**, even if it isn't a fully general theory of
meaning.

[^2]: @Holton2003Lewis is more nuanced, but does tell a similar story in
    the context of discussing Lewis's account of (potential) semantic
    indeterminacy. @Weatherson2010-VaI follows Holton in this respect.

[^3]: As some further evidence for how orthodox the 'orthodox'
    interpretation is, note that @Williams2007 is a prize winning essay
    published with two commentaries in the *Philosophical Review*. That
    paper takes the orthodox interpretation as its starting point, and
    neither of the commentaries (@Bays2007 and @Hawthorne2007) criticise
    this starting point.

[^4]: @Schwarz2006 develops his criticism of orthodoxy in more detail,
    and in English, but it is as yet unpublished.

[^5]: These points are stressed by Wolfgang @Schwarz2006 [@Schwarz2009].
    He also notes that in "Putnam's Paradox" Lewis explicitly sets these
    parts of his theory aside so he can discuss Putnam's arguments on
    grounds most favourable to Putnam. As Schwarz says, this should make
    us suspicious of the central role "Putnam's Paradox" plays in
    defences of the orthodox interpretation. We will return to this
    point in the section on textual evidence for and against orthodoxy.

    A referee notes, correctly, that the phrase 'in the first instance'
    is doing a lot of work here. That's right; we'll return in much more
    detail below to Lewisian theories of word meaning, and what role
    naturalness plays in them.

[^6]: The view I'm attributing to Lewis is endorsed by one prominent
    supporter of the orthodox interpretation, namely Ted Sider. See his
    [-@Sider2012 35ff].
