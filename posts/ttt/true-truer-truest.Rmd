What the world needs now is another theory of vagueness. Not because the
old theories are useless. Quite the contrary, the old theories provide
many of the materials we need to construct the truest theory of
vagueness ever seen. The theory shall be similar in motivation to
supervaluationism, but more akin to many-valued theories in
conceptualisation. What I take from the many-valued theories is the idea
that some sentences can be *truer* than others. But I say very different
things to the ordering over sentences this relation generates. I say it
is not a linear ordering, so it cannot be represented by the real
numbers. I also argue that since there is higher-order vagueness, any
mapping between sentences and mathematical objects is bound to be
inappropriate. This is no cause for regret; we can say all we want to
say by using the comparative *truer than* without mapping it onto some
mathematical objects. From supervaluationism I take the idea that we can
keep classical logic without keeping the familiar bivalent semantics for
classical logic. But my preservation of classical logic is more
comprehensive than is normally permitted by supervaluationism, for I
preserve classical inference rules as well as classical sequents. And I
do this without relying on the concept of acceptable precisifications as
an unexplained explainer.

The world does not need another guide to varieties of theories of
vagueness, especially since Timothy @Williamson1994-WILV and Rosanna
@Keefe2000 have already provided quite good guides. I assume throughout
familiarity with popular theories of vagueness.

### Truer

The core of my theory is that some sentences involving vague terms are
truer than others. I won't give an analysis of *truer*, instead I will
argue that we already tacitly understand this relation. The main
argument for this will turn on a consideration of two 'many-valued'
theories of vagueness, one of which will play a central role (as the
primary villain) in what follows.

The most familiar many-valued theory, call it $M$, says there are
continuum many truth values, and they can be felicitously represented by
the interval $[0,~1]$. The four main logical connectives: *and*, *or*,
*if* and *not* are truth-functional. The functions are:

$$
\begin{align}
V(A \wedge B) &= min(V(A), V(B))   \\
V(A \vee B) &= max(V(A), V(B))   \\
V(A \rightarrow B) &= max(1, 1 - V(A) + V(B)) \\
V(\neg A) &= 1 - V(A)
\end{align}
$$

where $V$ is the valuation function on sentences, $min(x, y)$ is the
smaller of $x$ and *y* and $max(x, y)$ is the larger of $x$ and *y*.

Adopting these rules for the connectives commits us to adopting the
logic Ł~C~. $M$ is the theory that this semantic model, under its most
natural interpretation, is appropriate for vague natural languages.
(We'll discuss less natural interpretations presently.)

$M$ tells a particularly nice story about the Sorites. A premise like
*If she's rich, someone with just a little less money is also rich* will
have a very high truth value. If we make the difference in money between
the two subjects small enough, this conditional will have a truth value
arbitrarily close to 1.

$M$ also tells a nice story about borderline cases and determinateness.
An object $a$ is a borderline case of being an $F$ just in case the
sentence *a is F* has a truth value between 0 and 1 exclusive.
Similarly, $a$ is a determinate $F$ just in case the truth value of *a
is F* is 1. (It is worthwhile comparing how simple this analysis of
determinateness is to the difficulties supervaluationists have in
providing an analysis of determinateness. On this topic, see
@Williamson1995, @McGee1998 and @Williamson2004-WILRTM.)

But $M$ tells a particularly implausible story about contradictions.
Here is how Timothy @Williamson1994-WILV makes this problem vivid.

> [@Williamson1994-WILV 136]

There is a way to keep the semantic engine behind $M$ while avoiding
this consequence. (The following few paragraphs are indebted pretty
heavily to the criticisms of Strawson's theory of descriptions in
@Dummett1959)

Consider an interpretation of the above semantics on which there are
only two truth values: True and False. Any sentence that gets truth
value 1 is true, all the others are false. The numbers in [0, 1)
represent different ways of being false. (As Tolstoy might have put it,
all true sentences are alike, but every false sentence is false in its
own unique way.) Which way a sentence is false can affect the truth
value of compounds containing that sentence. In particular, if $A$ and
$B$ are false, then the truth values of *Not A* and *If A then B* will
depend on the ways $A$ and $B$ take their truth values. If $V$($A$) = 0
and $V$($B$) = 0.3, then *Not A* and *If A then B* will be true, but if
$V$($A$) becomes 0.6, and remember this is just another way of being
false, both *Not A* and *If A then B* will be false.

The new theory we get, one I'll call $M_D$, is similar to $M$ in some
respects. For example, it agrees about what the axioms should be for a
logic for natural language. But it has several philosophical
differences. In particular, it has none of the three characteristics of
$M$ we noted above.

It cannot tell as plausible story as $M$ does about the Sorites. If any
sentence with truth value below 1 is false, then many of the premises in
a Sorites argument are *false*. This is terrible -- it was bad enough to
be told that one of the premises were false, but now we find many
thousands of them are false. I doubt that being told they are false in a
distinctive way will improve our estimation of the theory. Similarly, it
is hard to see just how the new theory has anything interesting to say
about the concept of a borderline case.

On the other hand, according to $M_D$, contradictions are always false.
To be sure, a contradiction might be false in some obscure new way, but
it is still false. Recall Williamson's objection that an explicit
contradiction should be true to degree 0 and nothing more. This
objection only works if being true to degree 0.5 is meant to be
semantically significant. If being 'true to degree 0.5' is just another
way of being false, then there is presumably nothing wrong with
contradictions are true to degree 0.5. This is not to say Williamson's
objection is no good, since he intended it as an objection to $M$, but
just to say that re-interpreting the semantic significance of the
numbers in $M$ makes a philosophical difference.

Despite $M_D$'s preferable treatment of contradictions, I think $M$ is
overall a better theory because it has a much better account of
borderline cases. But for now I want to stress a simpler point: $M$ and
$M_D$ are *different* theories of vagueness, and that we grasp the
difference between these theories. One crucial difference between the
two theories is that in $M$, but not $M_D$, $S_1$is truer than $S_2$ if
$V$($S_1$) is greater than $V$($S_2$). In $M_D$, if $S_1$is truer than
$S_2$, $V$($S_1$) must be one and $V$($S_2$) less than one. And that is
the *only* difference between the two theories. So if we understand this
difference, we must grasp this concept *truer than*. Indeed, it is in
virtue of grasping this concept that we understand why saying each of
the Sorites conditionals is almost true is a *prima facie* plausible
response to the Sorites, and why having a theory that implies
contradictions are truer than many other sentences is a rather
embarrassing thing.

I have implicitly defined *truer* by noting its theoretical role. As
David @Lewis1972a showed, terms can be implicitly defined by their
theoretical role. There is one unfortunate twist here in that *truer* is
defined by its role in a *false* theory, but that does not block the
implicit definition story. We know what *phlogiston* and *ether* mean
because of their role in some false theories. The meaning of *truer* can
be extracted in the same way from the false theory $M$.

### Further Reflections on *Truer*

As noted, I won't give a reductive analysis of *truer*. The hopes for
doing that are no better than the hopes of giving a reductive analysis
of *true*. But I will show that we pre-theoretically understand the
concept.

My primary argument for this has already been given. Intuitively we do
understand the difference between $M$ and its $M_D$, and this is only
explicable by our understanding *truer*. Hence we understand *truer*.

Second, it's noteworthy that *truer* is morphologically complex. If we
understand *true*, and understand the modifier -*er*, then we know
enough in principle to know how they combine. Not every predicate can be
turned into a comparative. But most can, and our default assumption
should be that *true* is like the majority.

I have heard two arguments against that assumption. First, it could be
argued that most comparatives in English generate linear orderings, but
*truer* generates a non-linear ordering. I reject the premise of this
argument. *Cuter*, *Smarter*, *Smellier*, and *Tougher* all generate
non-linear orderings over their respective domains, and they seem fairly
indicative of large classes. Second, it could be argued that it's
crucial to understanding comparatives that we understand the interaction
of the underlying adjectives with comparison classes. Robin Jeshion and
Mike Nelson made this objection in their comments on my paper at BSPC
2003. Again, the premise is not obviously true. We can talk about some
objects being *straighter* or *rounder* despite the fact that it's hard
to understand *round for an office building* or *straight for a line
drive*. (Jonathan Bennett made this point in discussion at BSPC.)
*Straight* and *round* either don't have or don't need comparison
classes, but they form comparatives. So *true*, which also does not take
comparison classes, could also form a comparative.

Finally, if understanding the inferential role of a logical operator
helps know its meaning, then it is notable that *truer* has a very clear
inferential role. It is the same as a strict material implication
$\square (q \supset p)$ defined using a necessity operator whose logic
is KT. Since many operators have just this logic, this doesn't
individuate *truer*, but it helps with inferential role semantics
aficionados.

I claim that the concept *truer*, and the associated concept *as true
as*, are the only theoretical tools we need to provide a complete theory
of vagueness. It is simplest to state the important features of my
theory by contrasting it with $M$. I keep the following good features of
$M$.

G1

:   There are *intermediate* sentences, i.e. sentences that are truer
    than some sentences and less true than others. For definiteness, I
    will say $S$ is intermediate iff $S$ is truer than 0=1 and less true
    than 0=0.

G2

:   $a$ is a borderline $F$ iff *a is F* is intermediate, and $a$ is
    determinately $F$ iff $a$ is $F$ and $a$ is not a borderline $F$.

I won't repeat the arguments here, but I take G1 to be a large advantage
of theories like $M$ over epistemicist theories. (See @Burgess2001,
@Sider2001 and @Weatherson2003-WEAEPA for more detailed arguments to
this effect.) And as noted G2 is a much simpler analysis of determinacy
and borderline than supervaluationists have been able to offer.

I drop the following bad features of $M$.

B1 *Some contradictions are intermediate sentences*.

:   \
    On my theory all contradictions are determinately false, and
    determinately determinately false, and so on. The argument for this
    has been given above.

B2 *Some classical tautologies are intermediate sentences*.

:   \
    On my theory all classical tautologies are determinately true, and
    determinately determinately true, and so on. We will note three
    arguments for this being an improvement in the next section.

B3 *Some classical inference rules are inadmissible*.

:   \
    On my theory all classical inference rules are admissible. As
    @Williamson1994-WILV showed, the most prominent version of
    supervaluationism is like $M$ in ruling some classical rules to be
    inadmissible, and this is clearly a cost of those theories.

B4 *Sentences of the form* S is intermediate *are never intermediate*

:   \
    I will argue below this is a consequence of $M$, and it means it is
    impossible to provide a plausible theory of higher-order vagueness
    within $M$. In my theory we can say that there is higher-order
    vagueness by treating *truer* as an iterable operator, so we can say
    that *S is intermediate* is intermediate. If $S$ is *a is F*, that's
    equivalent to saying that $a$ is a borderline case of a borderline
    case of an $F$. Essentially we get out theory of higher-order
    vagueness by simply iterating our theory of first-order vagueness,
    which is what Williamson does in his justly celebrated treatment of
    higher-order vagueness. Note it's not just $M$ that has troubles
    with higher-order vagueness. See @Williamson1994-WILV and
    @Weatherson2003-Keefe for the difficulties supervaluationists have
    with higher-order vagueness. The treatment of higher-order vagueness
    here is a substantial advantage of my theory over supervaluationism.

B5 *Truer is a linear relation*.

:   \
    On my theory it need not be the case that $S_1$is truer than $S_2$,
    or $S_2$ is truer than $S_1$, or they are as true as each other. In
    the last section I will argue that this is a substantial advantage
    of my theory. I claim that *truer* generates a Boolean lattice on
    possible sentences of the language. (For a familiar example of a
    Boolean lattice, think of the subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ ordered by the
    subset relation.)

I also provide a very different, and much more general, treatment of the
Sorites than is available within $M$. The biggest technical difference
between my theory and $M$ concerns the relationship between the
semantics and the logic. In $M$ the logic falls out from the
truth-tables. Since I do not have the concept of an intermediate truth
value in my theory, I could not provide anything like a truth-table.
Instead I posit several constraints on the interaction of *truer* with
familiar connectives, posit an analysis of validity in terms of *truer*,
and note that those two posits imply that all and only classically
admissible inference rules are admissible.

### Constraints on Truer and Classical Logic

The following ten constraints on *truer* seem intuitively compelling.
I've listed here both the philosophically important informal claim, and
the formal interpretation of that claim. (I use $A \geqslant _T B$ as
shorthand for $A$ *is at least as* *true as B*. Note all the quantifiers
over sentences here are *possibilist* quantifiers, we quantify over all
possible sentences in the language.)

(A1)

:   $\geqslant _T$ is a weak ordering (i.e. reflexive and transitive)\
    If $A \geqslant _T B$ and $B \geqslant _T C$ then
    $A \geqslant _T C$\
    $A \geqslant _T A$

(A2)

:   $\wedge$ is a greatest lower bound with respect to $\geqslant _T$\
    $A \wedge B \geqslant _T C$ iff $A \geqslant _T C$ and
    $B \geqslant _T C$\
    $C \geqslant _T$ *A*$\wedge B$ iff for all $S$ such that
    $A \geqslant _T S$ and $B \geqslant _T$*S* it is also the case that
    $C \geqslant _T S$

(A3)

:   $\vee$ is a least upper bound with respect to $\geqslant _T$\
    $A \vee B \geqslant _T C$ iff for all $S$ such that
    $S \geqslant _T A$ and $S \geqslant _T B$, it is also the case that
    $S \geqslant _T C$\
    $C \geqslant _T$ *A*$\vee B$ iff $C \geqslant _T A$ and
    $B \geqslant _T C$

(A4)

:   $\neg$ is ordering inverting with respect to $\geqslant _T$\
    $A \geqslant _T B$ iff $\neg B \geqslant _T \neg A$

(A5)

:   Double negation is redundant\
    $\neg \neg A =_T A$

(A6)

:   There is an absolutely false sentence $S_F$ and an absolutely true
    sentence $S_T$\
    There are sentences $S_F$and $S_T$such that $S_F =_T \neg S_T$ and
    $\neg S_F =_T S_T$  and for all $S$:
    $S_T \geqslant _T S \geqslant _T S_F$

(A7)

:   Contradictions are absolutely false\
    $A \wedge \neg A =_T S_F$

(A8)

:   $\forall$ is a greatest lower bound with respect to $\geqslant _T$\
    $A \geqslant _T \forall x$($\phi x$) iff for all $S$ such that for
    all $o$, if $n$ is a name of $o$ then $\phi n \geqslant _T S$, it is
    the case that $A \geqslant _T S$\
    $\forall x$($\phi x$) $\geqslant _T A$ iff for all $o$, if $n$ is a
    name of $o$ then $\phi n \geqslant _T A$

(A9)

:   $\exists$ is a least upper bound with respect to $\geqslant _T$\
    $A \geqslant _T \exists x$($\phi x$) iff for all $o$, if $n$ is a
    name of $o$ then
    $A \geqslant _T \phi$*n*$\exists x$($\phi x$) $\geqslant _T A$ iff
    for all $S$ such that for all $o$, if $n$ is a name of $o$ then
    $S \geqslant _T \phi n$, $S \geqslant _T A$

(A10)

:   A material implication with respect to $\geqslant _T$ can be
    defined.\
    There is an operative $\rightarrow$ such that

    1.  $B \rightarrow A \geqslant _T S_T$iff $A \geqslant _T B$

    2.  ($A \wedge B$)$\rightarrow C =_T A  \rightarrow$($B \rightarrow C$)

Apart from (A10) these are fairly straightforward. We can't argue for
(A10) by saying English *if...then* is a material implication, because
that leads directly to the paradoxes of material implication. Assuming
that $\neg A \vee B$ is a material implication is equivalent to assuming
(inter alia) that $A \vee \neg A$ is perfectly true. I believe this, but
since it is denied by many I want that to be a conclusion, not a
premise. So the argument for (A10) must be a little indirect. In
particular, we will appeal to the behaviour of quantifiers. We can
formally represent *All Fs are Gs* in two ways: using restricted or
unrestricted quantifiers. In the first case the formal representation
will look like:

> $\forall x$(*Fx* ? *Gx*)

with some connective in place of '?'. But it seems clear that whatever
connective goes in there must be a material implication. In the second
case, the formal representation will look like:

> [$\forall x$: *Fx*] *Gx*

In that case, we can define a connective $\nabla$ that satisfies the
definition of a material implication:

> $A \nabla B$ =~df~ [$\forall x$: $A \wedge x$=$x$]
> ($B \wedge x$=$x$)

This is equivalent to the odd (but intelligible) sentence *Everything
such that A is such that B*. Again, considerations about what should be
logical truths involving quantifiers suggests that $\nabla$ must be a
material implication. So either way there should be a material
implication present in the language, as (A10) says.

Given (A1) to (A10) it follows that this material implication is
equivalent to $\neg A \vee B$, and hence $A \vee \neg A$ is a logical
truth. This is a surprising *conclusion*, since intuitively vagueness
poses problems for excluded middle, but I think it is more plausible
that vague instances of excluded middle are problematic for *pragmatic*
reasons than that any of (A1) to (A10) are false.

What is interesting about these ten constraints is that they suffice for
classical logic, with just one more supposition. I assume that an
argument is *valid* iff it is impossible for the premises taken
collectively to be truer than the conclusion, i.e. iff it is impossible
for the conjunction of the premises to be truer than the conclusion.
Given that, we get:

> $\forall A_1$, ...,$A_n$,$B$: $A_1$, ..., $A_n \vdash$~T~ $B$ iff,
> according to classical logic, $A_1$, ..., $A_n$ $\vdash$ $B$

(I use $\Gamma$ $\vdash$~T~ $A$ to mean that in all models for
$\geqslant _T$ that satisfy the constraints, here (A1) to (A10), the
conclusion is at least as true as the greatest lower bound of the
premises.) I won't prove this result, but the idea is that (A1) to (A10)
imply that $\geqslant _T$ defines a Boolean lattice over equivalence
classes of sentences with respect to $=_T$. And all Boolean lattices are
models for classical logic, from which our result follows. Indeed,
Boolean lattices are models for classical logic in the strong sense that
classical inference rules, such as conditional proof and *reductio*, are
admissible in logics defined on them, so we also get the admissibility
of classical inference rules in this theory. (Note that this result only
holds in the right-to-left direction for languages that contain the
$\geqslant _T$ operator. Once this operator is added, some arguments
that are not classically valid, such as $B \geqslant _T A$,
$A \vdash$~T~ $B$, will valid. But the addition of this operator is
conservative: if we look at the $\geqslant _T$-free fragment of such
languages, the above result still holds in both directions.)

There are three reasons for wanting to keep classical logic in a theory
of vagueness. First, as Williamson has stressed, classical logic is at
the heart of many successful research programs. Second, non-classical
theories of vagueness tend to abandon too much of classical logic. For
instance, $M$ abandons the very plausible schema
($A \wedge A \rightarrow B$)$\rightarrow B$. The third reason is the one
given here - these ten independently plausible constraints on *truer*
entail that the logic for a language containing *truer* should be
classical. These three arguments add up to a powerful case that
non-classical theories like $M$ are mistaken, and we should prefer a
theory that preserved classical logic.

### Semantics and Proof Theory

In this section I will describe a semantics and proof theory for a
language containing *truer* as an iterable operator. This is important
for the theory of higher-order vagueness. I say that $a$ is a borderline
borderline $F$ just in case the sentence *a is a borderline F* is
intermediate, where 'borderline' is analysed as in section 2. It might
not be obvious that it is consistent with (A1) to (A10) that any
sentence *a is a borderline F* could be consistent. One virtue of the
model theory outlined here is that it shows this is consistent.

For comparison, note that $M$ as it stands has no way of dealing with
higher-order vagueness, i.e. with borderline cases of borderline cases
of $F$-ness. If every sentence *a is a borderline F* either does or does
not receive an integer truth value, then this intuitive possibility is
ruled out. We cannot solve the problem simply by iterating $M$. (This is
a point stressed by [@Williamson1994-WILV Ch. 4].) We cannot say that it
is true to degree 0.5 than (2) is true to degree 1, and true to degree
0.5 that it is true to degree 0.8. For then it is only true to degree
0.5 that (2) has some truth value or other. And the use of truth-tables
to generate a logic presupposes that every sentence has some truth
values or other. If this is not determinately true, $M$ is not a
complete theory. So the model theory will show that our theory is
substantially better than $M$ in this respect.

Consider the following (minor) variant on KT. Vary the syntax so
$\square A$ is only well-formed if $A$ is of the form $B \rightarrow C$.
Call the resulting logic KT~R~, with the R indicating the syntactic
restriction. The restriction makes very little difference. Since $A$ is
equivalent to ($A \rightarrow A$) $\rightarrow A$, even if $\square A$
is not well-formed in KT~R~, the KT-equivalent sentence
$\square$(($A \rightarrow A$) $\rightarrow A$) will be well-formed. The
Kripke models for KT~R~ are quite natural. $\square$($B \rightarrow C$)
is true at a point iff all accessible points at which $B$ is true are
points at which $C$ is true. (There is no restriction on the
accessibility relation other than reflexivity.)

Since KT~R~ is so similar to KT, we can derive most of its formal
properties by looking at the derivations of similar properties for KT.
(The next few paragraphs owe a lot to [@Goldblatt1992 Chs.1-3].) Let's
start with an axiomatic proof theory. The axioms for KT~R~ are:

-   All classical tautologies

-   All well-formed instances of K:
    $\square$($A \rightarrow B$) $\rightarrow$ ($\square A \rightarrow \square B$)

-   All well-formed instances of T: $\square A \rightarrow A$

The rules for KT~R~ are

Modus Ponens

:   If $A \rightarrow B$ is a theorem and $A$ is a theorem, then $B$ is
    a theorem

Restricted Necessitation

:   If $A$ is a theorem and $\square A$ is well-formed, then $\square A$
    is a theorem.

Given these, we can now define a maximal consistent set for KT~R~. It is
a set $S$ of sentences with the following three properties:

-   All theorems of KT~R~ are in $S$.

-   For all $A$, either $A$ is in *S* or $\neg A$ is in $S$.

-   $S$ is closed under modus ponens.

The existence of Kripke models for KT~R~ show that some maximal
consistent sets exist: the set of truths at any point will be a maximal
consistent set. The canonical model for KT~R~ is
$\langle W, R, V \rangle$ where

-   *W* is the set of maximal consistent sets for KT~R~

-   *R* is a subset of *W* $\times$ *W* such that *w*~1~*Rw*~2~ iff for
    all $A$ such that $\square A \in$ *w*~1~, $A \in$ *w*~2~

-   $V$ is the valuation such that $V$($A$) = {*w*: $A \in$ *w*}

Since all instances of T are theorems, it can be easily shown that *R*
is reflexive, and hence that this is a frame for KT~R~ and hence that
KT~R~ is canonically complete.

We can translate all sentences of KT~R~ into a language that contains
$\geqslant _T$ but not $\square$. Just replace
$\square$($B \rightarrow A$) with $A \geqslant _T B$ wherever $\square$
occurs including inside sentences. (We appeal here and here alone to the
restriction in KT~R~.) Translating the axioms for KT~R~, we get the
following axioms for the logic of $\geqslant _T$.

-   All classical tautologies

-   All instances of:
    ($B$  $\geqslant _T A$) $\rightarrow$ (($A \geqslant _T$ ($A \rightarrow A$)) $\rightarrow$
    ($B \geqslant _T$ ($B \rightarrow B$)))

-   All instances of:
    ($B \geqslant _T A$) $\rightarrow$ ($A \rightarrow B$)

The rules are

Modus ponens

:   If $A \rightarrow B$ is a theorem and $A$ is a theorem, then $B$ is
    a theorem.

Determination

:   If $A \rightarrow B$ is a theorem, then $B \geqslant _T A$ is a
    theorem.

We can simplify somewhat by replacing the second axiom schema with

-   All instances of:
    $A \geqslant _T B \rightarrow$ ($B \geqslant _T C \rightarrow A \geqslant _T C$)

A Kripke model for this logic is just a Kripke model for KT, except we
say $B \geqslant _T A$ is true at a point iff $B$ is true at all
accessible points at which $A$ is true. This leads to a semantic
definition of validity. An argument is valid iff it preserves truth at
any point in all such models.

Maximal consistent sets with respect to $\geqslant _T$ and a canonical
model for $\geqslant _T$ can be easily constructed by parallel with the
maximal consistent sets and canonical models for KT~R~. These
constructions show that if $A$ is a theorem of the logic for
$\geqslant _T$, then it is true at all points in all models. More
generally, they can be used to show that this logic is canonically
complete, though the details of the proof are omitted. The maximal
consistent sets for $\geqslant _T$, i.e. the points in the canonical
model, just are the results of applying the translation rule
$\square$($B \rightarrow A$) $\Rightarrow A \geqslant _T B$ to the
(sentences in the) maximal consistent sets for KT~R~.

That's important because the points in the canonical model for
$\geqslant _T$ are useful for understanding the relationship between
*truer* and *true*, and for understanding what languages are. The set of
true sentences in English is one of the points in the canonical model
for $\geqslant _T$. For semantic purposes, languages just are points in
this canonical model. It is indeterminate just which such point English
is, but it is one of them. For many purposes it is useful to think of
the theory based on *truer* as a variant on $M$. But considering the
canonical model for $\geqslant _T$ highlights the similarities with
supervaluationism rather than the similarities with $M$, for the points
in the canonical model look a lot like precisifications. It is, however,
worth noting the many differences between my theory and
supervaluationism. I identify languages with a single point rather than
with a set of points, which leads to the smoother treatment of
higher-order vagueness on my account. Also, I don't start with a set of
acceptable points/precisifications. The canonical model contains all the
points that are formally consistent, and I identify particular
languages, like English, by vaguely saying that the point that
represents English is (roughly) there. (Imagine my vaguely pointing at
some part of the model when saying this.) The most important difference
is that I take the points, with the truer than relation already defined,
to be primitive, and the accessibility/acceptability relation to be
defined in terms of them. This reflects the fact that I take the *truer*
relation to be primitive, and determinacy to be defined in terms of it,
whereas typically supervaluationists do things the other way around.
None of these differences are huge, but they all favour my theory over
supervaluationism.

To return to the point about higher order vagueness, note that all of
the following sentences are consistent in KT, and hence their
'equivalents' using \>~T~ are also consistent.

And obviously this pattern can be extended indefinitely. In general, any
claim of the form that $a$ is an $n$-th order borderline case of an $F$
is consistent in this theory, as can be seen by comparison with KT.

To close this section, I will note that we can also provide a fairly
straightforward natural deduction system for the logic of
$\geqslant _T$. There are two philosophical benefits to doing this.
First, it proves my earlier claim that I can keep all inference rules of
classical logic. Second, it helps justify (A1) to (A10). Most rules
correspond directly to one of the constraints. For that reason I've set
all the rules, even though you've probably seen most of them before.

### Sexy Sorites 

A good theory of vagueness should tell us two things about the Sorites.
The easy part is to say what is wrong with Sorites arguments: not all
premises are perfectly true. The hard part is to say why the premises
looked plausible to start with. The $M$ theorist has the beginnings of a
story, though not the end of a story. The beginning is that all the
premises in a typical Sorites argument are nearly true, and they look
plausible because we confuse near truth for truth. Can I say the same
thing, since my theory is like $M$? No, for two reasons. First, since my
theory explicitly gets rid of numerical representations of intermediate
truth values, I don't have any way to analyse *almost true*. Second,
since I say that one of the Sorites premises is false, I'd be committed
to the odd view that some false sentence is almost perfectly true.
Thanks to Cian Dorr for pointing out this consequence.

The story the $M$ theorist tells does not generalise. The problem is
that not all Sorites arguments involve conditionals. A typical Sorites
situation involves a chain from a definite $F$ to a definite not-$F$.
Let $^\prime$ denote the successor relation in this sequence, so if $F$
is *is tall* and $a$ is 178cm tall, then $a ^\prime$ will be 177.99cm
tall, assuming the sequence progresses 0.1mm at a time. According to
$M$, every premise like (SI) is almost true.

(SI)

:   If $a$ is tall, then $a ^\prime$ is tall.

But we could have built a Sorites argument with premises like (SA).

(SA)

:   It is not the case that $a$ is tall and $a ^\prime$ is not tall.

And premises of this form are not, in general, almost true. Indeed, some
will have a truth value not much about 0.5. So $M$ has no explanation
for why premises like (SA) look persuasive. This is quite bad, because
(SA) is *more* plausible than (SI) as I'll now show. Consider the
following thought experiment. You are trying to get a group of
(typically non-responsive) undergraduates to appreciate the force of the
Sorites paradox. If they don't feel the force of (SI), how do you
persuade them? My first instinct is to appeal to something like (SA). If
that doesn't work, I appeal to theoretical considerations about how our
use of *tall* couldn't possibly pick a boundary between $a$ and
$a ^\prime$. I think I find (SI) plausible *because* I find (SA)
plausible, and I would try to get the students to feel likewise. There's
an asymmetry here. I wouldn't defend (SA) by appealing to (SI), and I
don't find (SA) plausible because it follows from (SI). (This is not to
endorse universally quantified versions of either (SA) or (SI). They are
like Axiom V - claims that remain intuitively plausible even when we
know they are false.)

Sadly, many theories have little to say about why (SA) seems true. The
official epistemicist story is that speakers only accept sentences that
are determinately, i.e. knowably, true. But some instances of (SA) are
actually *false*, and many many more are not knowably true. The
supervaluationist story about (SA) is no better.

Here's a surprising fact about the Sorites that puts an unexpected
constraint on explanations of why (SA) is plausible. In the history of
debates about it, I don't think anyone has put forward a Sorites
argument where the major premises are like (SO).

(SO)

:   Either $a$ is not tall, or $a ^\prime$ is tall.

(This point is also noticed in @SiderBraun.) There's a good reason for
this: (SO) is *not* intuitively true, unless perhaps one sees it as a
roundabout way of saying (SA). In this respect it conflicts quite
sharply with (SA), which *is* intuitively true. But hardly any theory of
vagueness (certainly not $M$ or supervaluationism or epistemicism)
provide grounds for distinguishing (SA) from (SO), since most theories
of vagueness endorse DeMorgan's laws. Further, none of the many and
varied recent solutions to the Sorites that do not rely on varying the
underlying logic (e.g. @Fara2000 [@Sorensen2001; @Eklund2002]) seem to
do any better at distinguishing (SA) from (SO). As far as I can tell
none of these theories *could*, given their current conceptual
resources, tell a story about why (SA) is intuitively plausible that
does not falsely predict (SO) is intuitively plausible. That is, none of
these theories could solve the Sorites paradox with their current
resources.

There is, however, a simple theory that does predict that (SA) will look
plausible while (SO) will not. Kit @Fine1975a noted that if we assume
that speakers systematically confuse $p$ for *Determinately p*, even
when $p$ occurs as a constituent of larger sentences rather than as a
standalone sentence, then we can explain why speakers may accept vague
instances of the law of non-contradiction, but not vague instances of
the law of excluded middle. (That speakers do have these differing
reactions to the two laws has been noted in a few places, most
prominently @Burgess1987 and @Tappenden1993.) It's actually rather
remarkable how many true predictions one can make using Fine's
hypothesis. It correctly predicts that (5) should sound acceptable.

Now (5) is a contradiction, so both the fact that it sounds acceptable
if I am a borderline case of vagueness, and the fact that some theory
predicts this, are quite remarkable. This is about as good as it gets in
terms of evidence for a philosophical claim.

(We might wonder just why Fine's hypothesis is true. One idea is that
there really isn't any difference in truth value between $p$ and
*Determinately p*. This leads to the absurd position that some
contradictions, like (5), are literally true. I prefer the following
two-part explanation. The first part is that when one utters a simple
subject-predicate sentence, one implicates that the subject
*determinately* satisfies the predicate. This is a much stronger
implicature than conversational implicature, since it is not
cancellable. And it does not seem to be a conventional implicature.
Rather, it falls into the category of nonconventional nonconversational
implicatures Grice suggests exists on pg. 41 of his [-@Grice1989]. The
second part is that some implicatures, including determinacy
implicatures, are computed locally and the results of the computations
passed up to whatever system computes the intuitive content of the whole
sentence. This implies that constituents of sentences can have
implicatures. This theme has been studied quite a bit recently; see
@Levinson2000 for a survey of the linguistic data and @Sedivy1999 for
some empirical evidence supporting up this claim. Just which, if any,
implicatures are computed locally is a major research question, but
there is *some* evidence that Fine's hypothesis is the consequence of a
relatively deep fact about linguistic processing. This isn't essential
to the current project - really all that matters is that Fine's
hypothesis is true - but it does suggest some interesting further lines
of research and connections to ongoing research projects.)

If Fine's hypothesis is true, then we have a simple explanation for the
attractiveness of (SA). Speakers regularly confuse (SA) for (6), which
is true, while they confuse (SO) for (7), which is false.

This explanation cannot *directly* explain why speakers find (SI)
attractive. My explanation for this, however, has already been given.
The intuitive force behind (SI) comes from the fact that it follows, or
at least appears to follow, from (SA), which looks practically
undeniable.

So Fine's hypothesis gives us an explanation of what's going on in
Sorites arguments that is available in principle to a wide variety of
theorists. Fine proposed it in part to defend a supervaluationist
theory, and @Keefe2000 adopts it for a similar purpose. Patrick
@Greenough2003 has recently adopted a similar looking proposal to
provide an epistemicist explanation of similar data. (Nothing in the
explanation of the attractiveness of Sorites premises turns on any
*analysis* of determinacy, so the story can be told by epistemicists and
supervaluationists alike.) And the story can be added to the theory of
*truer* sketched here. It might be regretted that we don't have a
*distinctive* story about the Sorites in terms of *truer*. But the
hypothesis that some sentences are truer than others is basically a
*semantic* hypothesis, and if the reason Sorites premises look
attractive is anything like the reason (5) looks *prima facie*
attractive, then that attractiveness should receive a *pragmatic*
explanation. What is really important is that there be some story about
the Sorites we can tell.

### Linearity Intuitions

The assumption that *truer* is a non-linear relation is the basis for
most of the distinctive features of my theory, so it should be defended.
There are two reasons to believe it.

One is that we can't simultaneously accept all of the following five
principles.

-   *Truer* is a linear relation.

-   (A2), that conjunction is a greatest lower bound.

-   (A4), that negation is order inverting.

-   (A7), that contradictions are determinately false.

-   There are indeterminate sentences.

I think by far the least plausible of these is the first, so it must go.

Linearity (or at least determinate linearity) also makes it difficult to
tell a plausible story about higher order vagueness. Linearity is the
claim that for any two sentences $A$ and $B$, the following disjunction
holds. Either $A$ \>~T~ $B$, or $B$ \>~T~ $A$, or $A =_T B$. If truer is
determinately linear, that disjunction is determinately true. And if
*truer* is linear, and if that disjunction is determinately true, then
one of its disjuncts must be determinately true, for linearity rules out
the possibility of a determinately true disjunction with no
determinately true disjunct. Now take a special case of that
disjunction, where $B$ is 0=0. In that case we can rule out
$A$ \>~T~ $B$. So the only options are $B$ \>~T~ $A$ or $A =_T B$. We
have concluded that given linearity, one of these disjuncts must be
determinately true. That is, $A$ is either determinately intermediate or
determinately determinate. But intuitively neither of these need be
true, for $A$ might be in the 'penumbra' between the determinately
intermediate and the determinately determinate. This argument is only a
problem if we assume determinate linearity, but it's hard to see the
theoretical motivation for believing in linearity but not determinate
linearity.

Still, it is very easy to believe in linearity. Even for comparatives
that are clearly non-linear, like *more intelligent than*, there is a
strong temptation to treat them as linear. (Numerical measurements of
intelligence are obviously inappropriate given that *more intelligent
than* is non-linear, but there's a large industry involved in producing
such measurements.) And this temptation leads to some prima facie
plausible objections to my theory. (All of these objections arose in the
discussion of the paper at BSPC.)

##### True and Truer (due to Cian Dorr) {#true-and-truer-due-to-cian-dorr .unnumbered}

Here's an odd consequence of my theory plus the plausible assumption
that *If S then S is true* is axiomatic. We can't infer from $A$ is true
and $B$ is false that $A$ is truer than $B$. But this looks like a
reasonably plausible inference.

If we added this as inference rule, we would rule out all intermediate
sentences. To prove this assume, for *reductio*, that $A$ is
intermediate. Since we keep classical logic, we know $A \vee \neg A$ is
true. If *A*, then $A$ is true, and hence $\neg A$ is false. Then the
new this inference rule implies $A \geqslant _T \neg A$, hence
$A$${\wedge}{\neg}$$A \geqslant _T \neg A$, since
$\neg A \geqslant _T \neg A$, and hence 0=1$\geqslant _T \neg A$, since
0=1 $\geqslant _T A \wedge \neg A$, and $\geqslant _T$ is transitive. So
$A$ is determinately true, not intermediate. A converse proof shows that
if $\neg A$, then $A$ is determinately false, not intermediate. So by
($\vee$-Out) it follows that $A$ is not intermediate, but since $A$ was
arbitrary, there are no intermediate truths. So this rule is
unacceptable, despite its plausibility.

##### Comparing Negative and Positive (due to Jonathan Schaffer) {#comparing-negative-and-positive-due-to-jonathan-schaffer .unnumbered}

Let $a$ be a regular borderline case of genius, somewhere near the
middle of the penumbra. Let *b* be someone who is not a determinate case
of genius, but is very close. Let $A$ be *a is a genius* and $B$ be *b
is a genius*. It seems plausible that $A \geqslant _T \neg B$, since $a$
is right around the middle of the borderline cases of genius, but *b* is
only a smidgen short of clear genius. But since *b* is closer to being a
genius than $a$, we definitely have $B \geqslant _T A$. By transitivity,
it follows that $B \geqslant _T \neg B$, hence $B$ is determinately true
(by the reasoning of the last paragraph). Since $\neg B$ is not
determinately false, it follows that $B \wedge \neg B$ is not
determinately false, contradicting (A7).

Since I accept (A7) I must reject the initial assumption that
$A \geqslant _T \neg B$. But it's worth noting that this case is quite
general. Similar reasoning could be used to show that for any
indeterminate propositions of the form $x$ *is a genius* and *y* *is not
a genius*, the first is not truer than the second. This seems odd, since
intuitively these could both be indeterminate while the first is very
nearly true and the second very nearly false.

##### Comparing Different Predicates (due to Elizabeth Harman) {#comparing-different-predicates-due-to-elizabeth-harman .unnumbered}

One intuitive way to understand the behaviour of *truer* is that $A$ is
truer than $B$ iff $A$ is true on every admissible precisification on
which $B$ is true and the converse does not hold. This can't be an
analysis of *truer*, since it assumes we can independently define what
is an admissible precisification, and this seems impossible. But it's a
useful heuristic. And reflecting on it brings up a surprising
consequence of my theory. If we assume that precisifications of
predicates from different subject areas (e.g. *hexagonal* and *honest*)
are independent, it follows that subject-predicate sentences involving
those predicates and indeterminate instances of them are incomparable
with respect to truth. But this seems implausible. If France is a
borderline case of being hexagonal that is close to the lower bound, and
George Washington is a borderline case of being honest who is close to
the upper bound, then we should think *George Washington is honest* is
truer than *France is hexagonal*.

All three of these objections seem to me to turn on an underlying
intuition that *truer* should be a linear relation. If we are given
this, then the inference principle Dorr suggests looks unimpeachable,
and the comparisons Schaffer and Harman suggested look right. But once
we drop the idea that truer is linear, I think the plausibility of these
claims falls away. So the arguments against linearity are ipso facto
arguments that we should simply drop the intuitions Dorr, Schaffer and
Harman are relying upon.

To conclude, it's worth noting that a very similar inferential rule to
the rule Dorr suggests is admissible. From the fact that $A$ is
determinately true, and $B$ is determinately false, it follows that $A$
is truer than *B*. If we assume, as seems reasonable, that we're only in
a position to *say* that $A$ is true when it is determinately true, then
whenever we're in a position to say $A$ is true and $B$ is false, it
will be true that $A$ is truer than $B$. This line of defence is
obviously similar to the explanation I gave in the previous section of
why Sorites premises look plausible, and to the argument Rosanna Keefe
gives that the failure of classical inference rules is no difficulty for
supervaluationism because it admits very similar inference rules
[@Keefe2000].
