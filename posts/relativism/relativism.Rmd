Relativism, in the sense we're interested in here, is the view that the
truth of a sentence is relative both to a context of utterance and a
context of assessment. That the truth of a sentence is relative to a
context of utterance is uncontroversial in contemporary semantics. If
the authors of this paper were to both utter the sentence "I'm
Canadian", then one of us would say something true, and the other
something false. And that's because the truth of the utterance "I'm
Canadian" is sensitive to a feature of the context of utterance, namely
the identity of the speaker. And that in turn is explained by the fact
that the proposition expressed by that sentence is different in
different contexts. Relativists deny that this simple story can explain
all the ways in which context language.

</aside>

A core motivation for relativism comes from looking at the problems with
other views. So let's start by thinking about what might be happening
when a speaker says "This is tasty". (Call this utterance, which we'll
come back to a bit, U, and its speaker S.) The demonstrative 'this' is
context-sensitive, but let's assume it is clear what is being referred
to, and think about what contribution the predicate is making. There are
two natural proposals that are simple, easy to fit into familiar
frameworks, and most likely wrong.

First, the predicate might pick out an objective property of tastiness,
and when S utters U, she ascribes this property to a thing. This
objective view has a number of problems. First, there is a metaphysical
problem; just what is this objective tastiness? Second, there is an
epistemological problem. Typically, a speaker like S could be prepared
to utter U after taking one bite of the thing. But for most plausible
answers to the first question, it is unclear how they could know that
the object had that property. The two problems reinforce each other; The
more plausible answers to the metaphysical question make the property
sensitive to very abtruse conditions, such as how idealised observers
would react to ingesting the substance. But that makes it even more
unlikely that typical utterances of U satisfy the epistemological
requirement. (The points we're making here are well known, but our
presentation owes a lot to @Lasersohn2005.)

Second, the predicate might be context-sensitive. For concreteness,
let's focus on a very simple contextualist theory of 'tasty'. An
utterance of U is true, relative to a context $c$, iff the speaker in
$c$ likes the taste of the referent of 'this' in $c$. So "This is tasty"
and "I like the taste of this" express something very close to the same
proposition. (At least they express propositions that are necessarily
materially equivalent, but the relation between the two is probably
closer than that.) Again there are two problems, both of them to do with
the different dynamics of "This is tasty" and "I like the taste of
this". A hearer H, who does not like the taste of this substance, could
more readily disagree with "This is tasty" than with "I like the taste
of this". If H doesn't like its taste, he'll nevertheless concede that
S's utterance of "I like the taste of this" is true, but won't concede
that "This is tasty" is true. And a similar phenomenon occurs when S
herself changes her mind. If later she dislikes the taste of the
substance, she will be disposed to retract her utterance of "This is
tasty", but not of "I like the taste of this". So both disagreement and
retraction data pose problems for the contextualist. (On disagreement,
see especially Tamina @Stephenson2007. On retraction, and most
everything else we'll talk about in this paper, see John
@MacFarlane2014.)

If the objectivist and contextualist solutions fail, the relativist
suggests that they have a useful alternative. Say that truth is doubly
relativised, both to contexts of utterance and to context of assessment.
So the utterance, or perhaps just the proposition expressed by it, is
true relative to a context of assessment $c_a$ and context of utterance
$c_u$ iff the agent at $c_a$ likes the taste of the denotation of 'this'
in $c_u$. So now the truth of the utterance is relative both to the
context of utterance and the context of assessment. This solves the
metaphysical problem; talk about what a person likes is unproblematic.
It solves at least a version of the epistemological problem; a speaker
knows what they like, so can make utterances that are true in their
context. It solves a version of the disagreement problem; if H doesn't
like the taste of the stuff, he can truly say that what S said is not
true, since it isn't true in his context. And it explains the retraction
data, since once S changes her taste, what she said is no longer true
relative to her new context, and hence should be retracted.

As everywhere else in philosophy, arguments and claims can be and are
contested. In the quick case for relativism we've described so far,
there are at least four points where one could readily disagree.

1.  Whether objectivism is really vulnerable to the combination of the
    metaphysical and the epistemological arguments.

2.  Whether this version of contextualism is vulnerable to the
    disagreement and retraction arguments, and if so, whether these
    problems can be avoided by a more sophisticated contextualist
    theory.

3.  Whether relativism really does avoid the four problems posed for the
    other theories.

4.  Whether there are other theories that also avoid the problems,
    without running into the problems facing relativism or problems of
    their own.

In this entry, we'll focus on the last three points, since they are more
widely discussed in the literature than the first one. And indeed, the
last three points are extremely actively debated in recent years. We
won't try to take sides in those debates, though we will note that on no
point is the final picture nearly as rosy for the relativist as this
initial sketch may suggest.

We've so far focussed on one particular predicate, 'tasty', though the
points we've been making generalise to most predicates of personal
taste. But this is far from the only area where relativist theories have
been proposed. There has been a lot of discussion of relativist theories
of epistemic modals. The arguments here are fairly similar to the
arguments about predicates of personal taste (though see the discussion
below about syntax and control). And MacFarlane has argued for
relativist treatments of future contingents, and knowledge ascriptions.
We will not spend much time on those constructions explicitly, but the
issues they raise are broadly similar to the issues raised by predicates
of personal taste, and by epistemic modals.

We will largely bypass two quite different areas where relativist
theories have been proposed. Mark @Richard2008 has argued for a
relativist treatment of comparative adjectives. And
@Weatherson2011-NoRoyal arguedfor relativist treatments of areas of
certain areas discourse where common assumptions about the area are
false, and a relativist treatment might be the most charitable fix. As
interesting as we find these proposals, they haven't occasioned nearly
as much discussion as the proposals discussed above, and so we'll set
them aside.

What we will do is first clarify some of the many ways in which the term
'relativism' has been used in recent debates, then review some technical
material about indices and contexts that is essential for understanding
some relativist views, then look at the main line of recent debate
concerning relativism, the one centered on issues about retraction and
disagreement, and finally look at some syntactic evidence for
relativism.

### Varieties of Relativism {#varietiesofrelativism}

As we noted in the very first paragraph, it is uncontroversial that
sentence truth is sensitive to the context of utterance. It is extremely
contentious just how many such sentences are sensitive to the context of
utterance. (See, for instance [@DeRose2009;
@HarmanThomson1996; @Cappelen2005] for some of the disputes.) But that
there is some sensitivity here is uncontroversial. The view that a
sentence type's truth is sensitive to its context of utterance is
sometimes called "indexical relativism" [@Kolbel2004a; @Einheuser2008].
For some purposes this is a useful name. In particular, the view that
the content of moral predicates, and hence the truth value of
ascriptions of moral predicates, is sensitive to the context of
utterance does seem like a form of moral relativism, as that term is
standardly understood. It is, for instance, the view that @Harman1975
defends in a self-proclaimed defence of moral relativism. (That this was
traditionally known as relativism is stressed in @CappelenHuvenes2014,
who draw some interesting conclusions from this fact.) But for present
purposes we want to clearly exclude those views, and focus on much more
radical proposals that have been recently made.

There are two (overlapping) families of views that have been called
relativist, and which we will be concentrating on for the bulk of this
entry. They are:

-   Relativism about propositional truth - Whether a proposition is true
    is not an absolute fact. Propositions can be true relative to some
    contexts of assessment, and false relative to others.

-   Relativism about utterance truth - Whether an utterance is true is
    not an absolute fact. Utterances can be true relatve to some
    contexts of assessment, and false relative to others.

It isn't always clear whether a particular author, in defending
relativism, is primarily defending the first or second of these claims.
But it is natural to interpret most relativists as defending relativism
about propositional truth. This is most clearly true for @Kolbel2002 and
@Egan2007-EGAEMR, but there are few relativists that it is hard to
interpret as taking this to be the primary focus. The one big exception,
however, is the most prominent defender of relativism in the
contemporary literature, John @MacFarlane2014. He takes relativism about
utterance truth to be the only genuine form of relativism, though he
also endorses relativism about propositional truth. We are not going to
engage with the dispute over what is *really* a relativist view. Instead
we'll just describe a pair of views that are relativist in one of these
senses but not the other, to explain how the two senses come apart.

First, let's think about how to make propositional truth, but not
utterance truth, relative. Assume that Suzy actually swims, but that she
might not have. Then, on a natural way of thinking about modality, the
proposition *Suzy swims* will be true relative to the actual world, but
false relative to any possible world in which she does not. So
propositional truth is relative, with the relativity being to possible
worlds.

@CappelenHawthorne2009 argue that the reasoning of the previous
paragraph misunderstands the nature of truth and modality. The
proposition *Suzy swims* is, they say, simply true. It might have been
false. But that doesn't mean it is merely true relative to some world or
other; it just means that it might have had a different property than it
actually has. @Schaffer2012 argues that the things we say and think,
i.e., propositions, typically have worlds in their content, so what we
express by the sentence "Suzy swims" is the proposition *Suzy swims at
@*, and that proposition, like all propositions, has a non-relative
truth value.

Even if all that is wrong, and the contents of sentences like "Suzy
swims" are propositions that are true in some worlds, false in others,
there is a reason not to call this 'relativism'. After all, other worlds
don't exist, or at least don't exist in the way ours does. So it isn't
true that the proposition expressed by "Suzy swims" is true relative to
something and false relative to something else; there isn't a something
else for it to be false relative to.

Taking the last point on board, a serious relativism about propositional
truth should say that there is a proposition *p*, and two relata *a* and
*b* such that *p* is true relative to *a*, and false relative to *b*.
One way to do that, as seen in for example @Kaplan1977, is to make truth
relative to times, and believe that other times exist. (The contrast
here is with the eternalist view of propositions defended by
@Evans1985.) But the radical view that has been central to many recent
versions of relativism has been to say that truth is relative to world,
time, individual triples. So there is a proposition, for example, that
is true relative to a triple $\langle w, t, a \rangle$ iff in $w$, the
individual $a$ disapproves of murder at $t$. Perhaps, on a relativist
framework, this just is the proposition that murder is wrong. The
picture of propositions here owes something to the discussion of de se
beliefs in @Lewis1979b, since Lewis thought the contents of such beliefs
were sets of such triples. But Lewis put this forward as a theory about
mental content; the move to extending it to linguistic content is more
recent.

On this view, the contents of utterances will be propositions that can
be true relative to one individual (in a world, at a time) and false
relative to another. But the utterances themselves will naturally be
thought to have absolute truth value. Think back to the view that
propositional truth is just relative to worlds. Then an utterance of
"Suzy swims" will, intuitively, be true iff Suzy swims in the world the
utterance is made. When we think about a counterfactual utterance of
"Suzy swims" in a world where she does not, we don't think the utterance
is true just because its content is actually true. So although this is a
form of relativism about propositional truth, it is not yet a form of
relativism about utterance truth. MacFarlane, who takes utterance
relativism to be central, calls this view 'non-indexical contextualism',
with the name meant to highlight that it isn't, by his lights, genuinely
relativist.

Now turn to relativism about utterance truth. A simple way to implement
this is to say that the propositional content of an utterance is
relative to an assessor. So consider a very simple, and surely false,
view about 'you' in English. It holds that the content of an utterance
of 'you', relative to a context of assessment, is the agent of that
context. And it says that the utterance is true at a context of
assessment iff the proposition it expresses relative to that context is
(absolutely) true. So an utterance of "You swim" will express a
different proposition relative to contexts with different agents. And
since some of those propositions will be true, and some false, we have a
version of relativism about utterance truth. But this view is consistent
with the view that propositional truth is absolute, not relative even to
worlds.

So the two versions of relativism are dissociable. But it is also
possible to hold them simultaneously, as @MacFarlane2014 does. To set up
MacFarlane's view, it is helpful to review the framework against which
it was developed.

### Index, Context and Content {#indexcontextandcontent}

The existence of indexical terms, like 'I', means that we can't give a
theory for truth conditions of sentences as such. The sentence-type *I
am in Ann Arbor now* doesn't have truth conditions; only occurrences of
this sentence do. So a natural move is to build up a theory that assigns
to each term a function from contexts to contents, and use that to
provide a theory of which contexts a sentence is true in. It turns out
that there are reasons to endorse more complications than this. In
particular, sentences like (1) show the need for relativising truth
conditions relative to both a context and an *index*.

> \(1\) It might have been the case that my actual parents never met

That's true. But think of how we might naturally provide truth
conditions for it. First, we define the context-relative truth
conditions for "My actual parents never met.". The context will provide
a world for 'actually' (i.e., the actual world), and an agent for 'my'
(i.e., the speaker). Then, we say that the modal operator shifts the
world of evaluation. Intuitively, *Might p* is true iff *p* is true in
some possible world. So we need some way to see if the content of "My
actual parents never met" is true in some other world. But that's hard
to do, since (given origin essentialism), there will be no context in
which "My actual parents never met" can be truly uttered, so its content
will be the function that maps every context into FALSE. And that's the
same content as, for example, "Two plus two is five", and so it can't be
possibly true.

There are actually two related problems here. One is that while we need
to look around the other worlds to see whether some thing is true, the
nature of that thing is fixed by the actual context. So if the sentence
is uttered by Sasha Obama in this world, the content is something like
*It might have been the case that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama never
met*. We need to fix the values of the contextually sensitive terms
('my' and 'actual') even when they appear inside operators. The second
problem is that something as coarse-grained as a function is very hard
to 'shift' in just one respect.

There is a well-known solution to this, developed primarily by Hans
@Kamp1971, then put to important philosophical use by David @Lewis1980b
and David @Kaplan1977. Say that our semantic theory will assign a
function from both contexts and indices to terms. Ultimately, each
sentence will get as its semantic value a function from contexts and
indices to truth values. Lewis describes the distinction between
contexts and indices thus,

> A context is a location -- time, place, and possible world -- where a
> sentence is said. It has countless features, determined by the
> character of the location. An index is an n-tuple of features of
> context, but not necessarily features that go together in any possible
> context. Thus an index might consist of a speaker, a time before his
> birth, a worlds where he never lived at all, and so on.  [@Lewis1980b
> 79]

indices are structured, and so they can be 'improper'; it might consist
of things that don't go together. If the index contains just worlds and
individuals, the index could be $\langle w,$ Sasha Obama$\rangle$, even
if Sasha doesn't exist in $w$. Such an index will play a central role in
making (1), as uttered by Sasha Obama, true. A context, on the other
hand, will by its nature be proper; it will pick out a world, and a time
in that world, and a person existing at that time, and so on.

Indices are, unlike contexts, 'shiftable'. There can be sentential
operators that say the truth value of the whole sentence is given by
looking at the truth value of the embedded sentence at some different
index. Assume, for example, that there is a world parameter in the
index, so the index is $\langle w, x\rangle$, where $x$ contains
everything else in the index. Then *Might p* will be true relative to
context $c$ and index $\langle w, x\rangle$ just in case for some
$w^{\prime}$, *p* is true relative to context $c$ and index
$\langle w^{\prime}, x\rangle$. Note that in this definition, we do
*not* shift $c$; so if $c$ determines that the referent of 'I' is Sasha
Obama, that stays even if we 'shift' the index to a world where Sasha
does not exist.

The separation between context and index was developed to solve some
technical problems, but it can do some philosophical work. The theory
associates each sentence with a function from contexts and indices to
truth values. Equivalently, it associates sentence-context pairs with
functions from indices to truth values. So it is natural to say that the
content of an utterance is (or is at least intimately connected to) the
function associated with the pair consisting of the sentence uttered and
the context it was uttered in. If the index is simply a world, then the
contents will be functions from worlds to truth-values, as defended by
classical contextualists such as Robert @Stalnaker1984. David
@Lewis1980b objected that assigning contents at just this stage was
arbitrary, why not associate contents with functions from context to
truth values instead? François @Recanati2007 responds well to Lewis's
arguments, although his defence requires making indices much more
complex. In particular, he includes parameters for times and individuals
in the index, leading him to support relativism about propositional
truth.

With this background, we can more easily describe two distinctive
features of MacFarlane's views. First, he makes indices very complicated
indeed. The index might include, among other things, an information set
(for interpreting epistemic and deontic modals), a standard of taste
(for interpreting predicates of personal taste), relevant alternatives
(for interpreting knowledge ascriptions), a time (for handling future
contingents), and perhaps many more things. For simplicity, we'll call
these things collectively a *perspective*, and say that indices are
world-perspective pairs. (Though note that our terminology here requires
perspectives to be structured entities, and for them to be potentially
improper.) If the propositional content of an utterance is (intimately
connected to) a function from indices to truth-values, then the one
proposition will be true relative to one perspective and false relative
to another.

So far we only have relativism about propositional truth, or what
MacFarlane calls non-indexical contextualism. MacFarlane argues for a
second revision to contextualist orthodoxy. Assume that we have a
particular utterance $U$ of a sentence $S$ in context of utterance
$c_u$, and that utterance is being assessed in context $c_a$. And assume
that $w(c)$ is the world of context $c$, and $p(c)$ is the perspective
of context $c$. Sentence $S$ is associated with a function $f_S$ from
context-index pairs, i.e., context-world-perspective triples, to truth
values. The relativist about propositional truth, but not utterance
truth, says that $U$ is true iff $f_S(c_u, w(c_u), p(c_u)) = TRUE$.
MacFarlane's relativist[^1] says that $U$ is true iff
$f_S(c_u, w(c_u), p(c_a)) = TRUE$. Crucially, we assess the utterance
itself, and not just its content, by the perspective of the assessor.
MacFarlane argues that this move allows a better understanding of
disagreement and retraction, which were central to the phenomena that
motivated relativism. So let's turn to how well relativism explains the
phenomena it was designed to explain.

### Retraction and Disagreement {#retractionanddisagreement}

#### Retraction

Contextualists have a difficult time explaining why we retract earlier
claims involving predicates of personal taste or epistemically modals
assertions when our perspective has changed in the intervening time.
Consider this example:

> Kim (age 8): Lunchables are delicious.\
> Kim (age 26 being reminded of previous assertion): I take it back/I
> was wrong/what I said was false. Lunchables aren't delicious.

When Kim retracts her earlier assertion, it is natural to use any of the
three forms of retraction listed here. It isn't natural to say either of
the following things:

-   Lunchables were delicious back then, but they aren't delicious any
    more.

-   When I said that back then, I only meant that they were delicious to
    me back then.

There is a contrast with how clearly context sensitive terms like 'here'
are used. It isn't natural to use any of the three forms of retraction
we attribute to Kim below.

> Kim (in a café): It is pleasant here.\
> Kim (in an oil refinery, reminded of previous assertion) I take it
> back/I was wrong/What I said was false. It isn't pleasant here.

On the other hand, it is natural to say things like:

-   It was pleasant where we were, but it isn't pleasant where we are
    now.

-   When I said that back then, I only meant it was pleasant where we
    were.

Predicates of personal taste, like 'delicious', don't behave like
explicitly context-sensitive expressions like 'pleasant here'. We see
the same pattern with epistemic modals.

> Hakeem: It might be snowing outside.\
> Fabian: No/that's wrong/that's false, it can't be snowing. I just
> looked out the window and there were clear skies and the sun was out.\
> Hakeem: Really? Then I guess I was mistaken.

If *It might be that p* is true iff the speaker's knowledge is
compatible with *p*, as it does on a simple contextualist theory, then
none of this conversation makes any sense. But, argue relativists, it is
perfectly natural. A natural move here is to argue that the problem with
simple contextualism isn't the contextualism, but the simplicity.
Exploring the moves that can be made here will take us too far afield;
@MacFarlane2014 goes through a number of possible alternative
contextualist theories and shows how examples like the ones involving
Kim, Hakeem and Fabian can be generated to raise problems for each of
them. Instead, let's look at how the relativist handles the cases.

According to MacFarlane, relativists are committed to the following
principle about retraction:

> The speaker ought to retract the assertion if she has good grounds for
> thinking that its content is false (as assessed from the perspective
> she currently occupies).

Given that Kim and Hakeem are evaluating their earlier utterances from
new perspectives, perspectives where the assertions are now judged to be
false, they both should retract that earlier assertion because they now
take them to be false. But arguably this principle overgenerates.
Consider this example from @vonFintelGillies2008.

> Alex: The keys might be in the drawer.\
> Billy: (Looks in the drawer, agitated) They're not. Why did you say
> that?\
> Alex: Look, I didn't say that they were in the drawer. I said they
> might be there -- and they might have been. Sheesh.
>  [@vonFintelGillies2008 81]

The lesson they draw from the example is that retraction is somewhat
voluntary. Despite what relativists claim, it is not always true that
'might' claims are retracted or rejected in light of new evidence.
Instead, what seems to be true is that that solipsistic readings for the
modals are virtually always available. They say that the relativist
can't easily explain this data. @MacFarlane2014 [Ch. 10] responds by
saying, in effect, that epistemic modal claims sometimes mean what
contextualists say they mean, and this is compatible with relativism.

#### Disagreement and Agreement {#disagreementandagreement}

The data about retraction are closely related to a phenomenon that
classically was central to debates about relativism. A traditional
argument for relativism is that it is necessary to explain 'faultless
disagreement'. If one person says Vegemite is tasty, and another says
that it is not, the alleged datum is that they are disagreeing, but
neither is wrong. Objective treatments of taste save the phenomenon of
disagreement, but lose the faultlessness. Contextualist, or otherwise
subjective, treatments of taste save the faultlessness, but lose the
disagreement. Relativism was alleged to keep both. Faultless
disagreement plays a big role in @Kolbel2002, but it has dropped out of
the recent literature somewhat. But the focus on disagreement remains,
with the central claim being that contextualists cannot explain why some
conversations are genuinely disagreements. The following is how
MacFarlane puts the point using an example from predicates of personal
taste:

> If the truth of my claim that a food is "tasty" depends on how it
> strikes me, while the truth of your claim that the same food is "not
> tasty" depends on how it strikes you, then our claims are compatible,
> and we do not disagree in making them. But it seems that we do
> disagree--even if we are aware that the source of our disagreement is
> our differing tastes.  [@MacFarlane2014 8]

This is no argument against any kind of objectivist treatment of
predicates of personal taste. The issue is solely whether relativism or
contextualism does a better job of explaining the facts about
disagreement. We'll look at a couple of reasons for thinking that the
problem is less pressing for contextualists than it might first seem,
then an interesting attempt to resolve the problems that remain for
contextualism, then at some reasons for doubting that relativism helps
solve the remaining problems.

#### Clarifying the Data {#clarifyingthedata}

The puzzle for contextualism is supposed to be that there is a big
difference between the felicity of Mark's reply in the following two
cases.

> Sally: This chilli is tasty.\
> Mark: I disagree. It's too hot.

> Sally: I'm from Barcelona.\
> Mark: I disagree. \#I'm from Oslo.

Assume Sally and Mark are both being sincere. So Sally does like the
chilli and is from Barcelona, and Mark doesn't like it and is from Oslo.
In neither case can Mark sincerely repeat the words that Sally uttered.
Indeed, he can sincerely utter the negations of the sentences Sally
uttered. But in the first case, this seems to amount to a disagreement,
and in the second case it does not. If the context-sensitivity of
'tasty' and 'I' is explained the same way, this is mysterious.

But note that there are other examples that do not seem to be amenable
to a relativist treatment where Mark can express disagreement with
Sally.

> Sally: I like this chilli.\
> Mark: I disagree. It is too hot.

What seems to be going on there is that Mark is disagreeing with an
attitude that Sally has, but not with any proposition she expressed.
After all, Mark presumably agrees with the proposition that Sally likes
the chilli. That's why he knows he is disagreeing with her. And that's
the content of what he uttered. So some disagreements that are triggered
by assertions are not with the content of what is asserted. This might
be the germ of an idea for how contextualists can explain the data about
disagreement, one nicely developed by Torfinn @Huvenes2012. He argues
that in a lot of cases of disagreements involving taste, what we see is
not a disagreement about any content, but a disagreement of attitudes.

> Two parties disagree just in case there is something towards which
> they have conflicting attitudes. This sometimes means that there is a
> content that one party accepts and the other rejects, but that does
> not always have to be the case. Just as two parties may have
> conflicting beliefs, they may also have conflicting desires or
> preferences.  [@Huvenes2012 178]

If Huvenes is right, then we can't draw any conclusions for semantics
from the facts about disagreement.

There is a further problem with using facts about disagreement to argue
against contextualism. Consider the following dialogue.

> Sally: Joe might be in Boston.\
> Mark: I disagree; he's definitely in China.

If *Joe might be in Boston* just means *For all I know, Joe is in
Boston*, then it is prima facie unclear why Mark is disagreeing. After
all, it is consistent with Joe's being in China that for all Sally
knows, Joe is in Boston. But, say some contextualists, Mark need not
disagree with the whole content of Sally's utterance. He may just be
disagreeing with the *prejacent* of the modal, i.e., that Joe is in
Boston.

Most of the terms of disagreement that have been used in examples
motivating anti-contextlism can be seen to target something other than
the entire proposition  [@vonFintelGillies2008 83]. This is a particular
problem for arguments for relativism involving epistemic modals. It's
possible to say "I disagree", "that's false", "no", or "you're mistaken"
and disagree with the prejacent of someone's modal claim, not
necessarily the whole claim.

One potential avenue for the relativist to get around this worry is to
limit the range of disagreement markers that count as expressing the
right kind of disagreement. For example, Tamina @Stephenson2007 limits
the terms of disagreement in the examples she uses to "no" and "nuh-uh".
And John @MacFarlane2014 [11] discusses disagreements that more
explicitly target the entire asserted proposition such as "the
proposition you expressed is false" and "what you asserted is false".
The issue with the two former disagreement markers is that they can
explicitly target the embedded clause of an expression. Indeed,
Stephenson herself provides a clear example of this phenomenon.

> Mary: How's the cake?\
> Sam: I think it's tasty.\
> Sue: Nuh-uh, it isn't tasty at all!  [@Stephenson2007 512]

The issue with the disagreement markers that MacFarlane uses is that
they have become too technical to do the type of work they need to do.
Relativism is meant to be an empirical thesis that relied on natural
language data to back it up. We have moved well outside of the realm of
natural language and the types of natural language intuitions about the
acceptability of sentences that we can get when we move to "the
proposition you expressed is false" and "what you asserted is false".

Note that the two contextualist responses we've described here are
rather complementary. The point Huvenes makes, that disagreements can
involve attitudes other than belief, seems best served to defuse
arguments from disagreements concerning predicates of personal taste.
And the point that von Fintel and Gillies make, that disagreements can
target prejacents, seems best served to defuse arguments from
disagreements concerning epistemic modals. It is possible there are
replies to this last point; @WeathersonEgan2011 for example suggest that
examples involving agreements are invulnerable to the response that von
Fintel and Gillies make. But as it stands, the dominant trend in the
literature seems to be in the direction of thinking the contextualist
has the resources to answer these relativist arguments.

#### Presuppositions and Common Context {#presuppositionsandcommoncontext}

There is a more radical, and perhaps more concessive, response to the
disagreement arguments available to the contextualist. Dan
@LopezDeSa2008b develops a contextualist theory that explains the
disagreement data by positing that for many context-sensitive terms,
there is a presupposition that users of the term are in the same
context. (Note that López de Sa calls his theory an "indexical
relativist" theory, but it is a kind of contextualist theory in the way
the terms are being used here.)

It isn't true in general that there is a presupposition of commonality
of context. If two speakers both say "I am happy", they should be
interpreted as putting forward different propositions. And that is
because, in the relevant sense, they are in different contexts. But,
perhaps, many terms are not like this. In particular, cases where there
appears to be a problem with explaining the phenomena involving
disagreement, perhaps this is not so. So consider the stock example
López de Sa uses, a variant on one that may seem familiar by now.

> Hannah: Homer Simpson is funny.\
> Sarah: I disagree. Homer is not funny.

If 'funny' denotes a different property when Hannah and Sarah use it,
there is no disagreement about propositional content here. And the
contextualist account of predicates of personal taste would predict that
it could, and perhaps often will, denote a different propertty on
different occasions of usage. But it seems that there is a disagreement
here, and arguably even one about propositional content. The solution
López de Sa offers is that in any conversation, there is a
presupposition that we are applying the same aesthetic standards. The
model he uses is a suggestion made by David @Lewis1989b in defending a
contextualist treatment of claims about value.

> Wouldn't you hear them saying 'value for me and my mates' or value for

Here is how López de Sa develops the point.

This is an ingenious idea, but there are a few hurdles to be cleared
before it could be declared a full solution to the problem. First, it
needs a way to deal with eavesdroppers. If Hannah writes "Homer Simpson
is funny" on a scrap of paper, and later Sarah chances upon that paper,
she can still say that she disagrees. But it is very odd to think there
is a presupposition of commonality of taste with anyone who chances upon
one's writings. Second, it needs to account for cases where the
presupposition is expressly cancelled. The Hannah/Sarah dialogue feels
natural even in cases where it has been made explicit that Hannah and
Sarah have completely different tastes, and they are displaying their
differences for the amusement of their friends  [@MacFarlane2014
131--2]. Third, it doesn't quite capture the idea that Hannah and Sarah
are contradicting each other. When Sarah disagrees, it shows that either
there is a proposition one accepts and the other rejects, or that the
context is defective. If we thought the data was that there was a
contradiction between what they say, López de Sa's approach can't
explain that. And finally, it isn't obvious how to extend this theory to
other terms for which relativism seems promising. It is one thing to say
that conversations about humor presuppose a common standard for humor.
It is much less plausible to say that conversations about what might be
the case presuppose that the parties to the conversation know the same
things. None of these hurdles seem impossible to clear, but they do
raise doubts about whether presuppositions can solve all the
contextualists' problems with disagreement.

#### Relativism and Disagreement {#relativismanddisagreement}

If, after all that, we conclude that the contextualist still has a
problem with disagreement, it's fair to ask whether the relativist does
any better. Let's think again about López de Sa's example of Hannah and
Sarah.

> Hannah: Homer Simpson is funny.\
> Sarah: I disagree. Homer is not funny.

A simple relativist theory assigns truth conditions to Hannah's
utterance relative to a context of utterance, her own, and an index that
consists of a world-perspective pair. (Remember that we're using
'perspective' to cover everything other than a world that a relativist
may want to put into an index, and that it will be a structured entity.)
The content of Hannah's utterance will be set by her context. So it will
be (or at least will determine) a function from indices, i.e.,
world-perspective pairs, to truth-values. Call the world Hannah and
Sarah occupy $w$, and their perspectives $p_H$ and $p_S$. Then the
proposition that Homer Simpson is funny will be true relative to
$\langle w, p_H\rangle$ and false relative to $\langle w, p_S\rangle$.
So there is a proposition Hannah accepts and Sarah rejects, and so they
disagree. Doesn't think mean that the relativist can explain the sense
in which Hannah and Sarah disagree?

Not so fast. Consider another case involving One, who lives in $w_1$
where Mars has one moon, and Two, who lives in $w_2$ where Mars has two
moons. They make the following utterances:

> One: Mars has one moon.\
> Two: Mars has two moons.

Now most theorists would say that One and Two have expressed
propositions that cannot be true together. (As noted earlier,
@Schaffer2012 disagrees, though not in a way that helps relativism.) But
they don't disagree. Among other things, they both think that the other
speaks truly.

Hannah doesn't just think that the proposition that Homer Simpson is
funny is true relative to $\langle w, p_H\rangle$; she thinks it is
simply true. That is because she occupies (for want of a better word)
the index $\langle w, p_H\rangle$. And one doesn't just think that the
proposition that Mars has one moon is true relative to
$\langle w_1, p_1\rangle$, she thinks it is simply true. But in doing
so, she need not be in disagreement with someone who occupies a
different index, such as Two, and who thinks it is false. It isn't easy
to read off the existence of disagreement from the endorsement of
conflicting propositions when the parties occupy different indices. And
that raises doubts about whether the relativist has really explained the
disagreement. (The Mars example is from @MacFarlane2014 [128]. Both
@Dreier2009 and @Francen2010 raise doubts about whether the relativist
can explain disagreement.)

Part of MacFarlane's response to this is to insist that the different
elements of an index are treated differently. If we are relativists
about propositional truth, but not utterance truth, it is natural to
treat the two elements the same. A speaker, we'll then say, speaks truly
iff the proposition they express is true relative to the context they
occupy. But that isn't MacFarlane's view. He holds that an utterance is
true, i.e., that a speaker speaks truly, relative to a context of
assessment iff the proposition they express is true relative to the
world they occupy, and the perspective of the context of assessment.
This gives him a way to distinguish the Hannah/Sarah case from the
One/Two case. There is still a lot more work to do to turn this into a
full theory of disagreement, and chapter 5 of MacFarlane's book has a
very careful study of the varieties of disagreement that are possible on
a relativst theory, and how they can be used to explain the data. We're
not going to attempt to evaluate the success of these responses, but
rather conclude by noting that even if the contextualist has work to do
to explain the phenomena involving disagreement, so does the relativist.

#### Problems with the Data {#problemswiththedata}

Most of the arguments in the literature have started with intuitions
about disagreeement. We don't think there is anything wrong with this in
principle; indeed, it is what we've done so far. But when the intuitions
get a little shaky, as they are in a few cases we've described so far,
it is worth checking them more carefully, against a broader range of
informants. And when that is done, it isn't clear that the data help the
relativists as much as the relativists have claimed. @KnobeYalcin2014
provide evidence that the following claim, which we'll call (J), isn't
as empirically justified as the relativists have made it out to be.

> \(J\) Competent speaker/hearers tend to judge a present-tense bare
> epistemic possibility claim (BEP) true only if the prejacent is
> compatible with their information (whether or not they are the
> producer of that utterance); otherwise the BEP is judged false.

They argue that many relativists, in particular Egan and MacFarlane, are
committed to this claim. Although Egan and MacFarlane differ on several
points (Egan takes relativism about propositional truth to be primary,
MacFarlane relativism about utterance truth), it does seem true that (J)
is important to both of them. As Knobe and Yalcin put it,

> Egan and MacFarlane are both clearly animated by the thought that

> section entitled "Motivation for relativism: eavesdroppers").
>  [@KnobeYalcin2014 3--4]

This isn't what their data showed. The subjects were shown speakers
whose evidence strongly, but falsely, suggested that Fat Tony was dead.
They overwhelmingly said that an utterance of "Fat Tony is dead" is
false, but most said an utterance of "Fat Tony might be dead" was true.
(Though it is worth noting that the responses displayed a considerably
ambivalence; the answers weren't in line with what either a
contextualist or a relativist would straightforwardly predict.) The
subjects did say that it would be correct for the speaker who said "Fat
Tony might be dead" to retract that utterance once it was clear Fat Tony
was alive. But this typically wasn't because they thought the earlier
utterance was false.

The point of this study was not to directly target intuitions about
disagreement, but rather inter-contextual judgments and felicity of
retraction. But the issues are closely related. If subjects who know Fat
Tony is alive don't judge that an utterance of "Fat Tony might be dead"
is false, then either they don't disagree with such an utterer, or the
disagreement is, as Huvenes suggests, not the kind that motivates
altering our semantics in the direction relativists suggest.

As Knobe and Yalcin are careful to note, even if relativists were
completely wrong about inter-contextual evaluation of utterances, about
disagreement, and about retraction, there are still other arguments for
relativism. We'll end with one other such argument, due primarily to
Tamina @Stephenson2007.

### Control and Syntax {#controlandsyntax}

There is a striking semantic/syntactic phenomenon that epistemic modals
and predicates of personal taste share. It's easiest to describe the
phenomenon if we assume a contextualist semantics, though we'll
eventually use the puzzle to cast doubt on that semantics. So assume,
for now, that *It must be that p* is true iff *p* is guaranteed to be
true by the (possibly idealised) knowledge of *X*, where *X* is an
individual or group supplied by context. (And perhaps the amount of
idealisation is context-sensitive too.) And assume that *F is tasty* is
true iff *F* tastes good to (the possibly idealised version of) *X*,
where *X* is again supplied by context.

When 'might' or 'tasty' are not embedded, then *X* seems like it has to
include the speaker, and perhaps not much more than that. Even making
some other taster or knower salient does not suffice to change the value
of *X*. For instance, if one utters "Joe is a great cook and connoisseur
of fine food. The meals he prepares are always tasty," the last sentence
is not naturally construed as saying that *Joe* always likes the taste
of what Joe cooks, but that the speaker and her hearer do (or will). Or
if, to borrow an example from  [@Weatherson2011-NoRoyal], we say "Jones
must know who the killer is," the relevant *X* for interpreting the
'must' consists of the speaker and her hearers, not Jones. There is
something strange about this; it normally isn't that hard to make others
relevant in a way that makes them the value of a contextually filled
variable.

Or, perhaps, it isn't normally that hard with one key exception. Some
context-sensitive terms have, as part of their meaning, that their
extension includes the speaker. Such terms include 'I' and 'we'. Perhaps
'must' and 'tasty' are like 'I' and 'we' in this respect. Except, and
here is Stephenson's key insight, there is a big difference between
'I'/'we' and 'must'/'tasty'. The former still pick out the speaker (and
perhaps those near her) under the sceopt of an attitude verb. The latter
do not. Consider the natural interpretations of these sentences.

-   Joe thinks my gumbo is tasty.

-   Joe thinks we must have stolen the candy.

In each case, the personal pronouns ('my', 'we') have their customary
denotations. It is the speaker's gumbo that is being praised, and the
speaker and her friends who are being suspected of theft. But 'tasty'
and 'must' do not behave like that. It isn't that Joe thinks the speaker
likes the taste of her gumbo, but that Joe himself does. And it isn't
that Joe thinks the speaker's evidence entails her guilt, but that Joe's
evidence does.

Stephenson points out that we get even more dramatic results with more
complex sentences. Consider these two sentences.

-   Mary thinks that Sam thinks it must be raining.

-   Mary thinks that Sam must think it is raining.  [@Stephenson2007
    490]

The value of *X* for the first 'must' has to be Sam, and for the second
'must' it has to be Mary. In neither case is it the speaker, and in
neither case is it even particularly optional how to interpret the
'must'. Compare *Mary thinks that Jane likes her house*, which is
naturally read as three-way ambiguous. (The house might be Jane's, or
Mary's, or a contextually supplied third party's.) The general point
here is that the *X* values that the contextualist posits behave rather
unlike other implicit or explicit context-sensitive terms.

The relativist explanation of this is that epistemic modals, and
predicates of personal taste are, to use Stephenson's phrase,
"inherently judge-dependent". That is, they are inherently dependent on
some perspective for their truth. In the terms we've been using so far,
we need a perpective in the index, and not just in the context, to
explain the truth of these claims. When this is combined with a natural
view that attitude predicates obligatorily shift the perspective (or
judge) parameter, then it just naturally falls out that epistemic modals
must take on the perspective of the immediate subjective of the attitude
verb. Such a semantics is defended by Stephenson, and by Peter
@Lasersohn2005.

It falls out of this semantics that there cannot be "exocentric" uses of
bare epistemic modals. These are uses of bare epistemic modals that take
on the perspective of someone other than the speaker. (A similar point
applies to predicates of personal taste.) This is a nice explanation of
the fact that it is very hard to generate these exocentric uses. But it
arguably overgenerates; there are cases where it seems we do get the
exocentric reading. Here is one case from @Egan2005-EGAEMI.

> Ann is planning a surprise party for Bill. Unfortunately, Chris has
> discovered the surprise and told Bill all about it. Now Bill and Chris
> are having fun watching Ann try to set up the party without being
> discovered. Currently Ann is walking past Chris's apartment carrying a
> large supply of party hats. She sees a bus on which Bill frequently
> rides home, so she jumps into some nearby bushes to avoid being
> spotted. Bill, watching from Chris's window, is quite amused, but
> Chris is puzzled and asks Bill why Ann is hiding in the bushes. Bill
> says, "I might be on that bus"  [@Egan2005-EGAEMI 140]

The natural reading of what Bill says is that for all *Ann* knows, Bill
is on the bus. And this is predicted to be impossible on the type of
relativist view that gets us the correct results in the obligatory
control cases. Stephenson suggests that there is an ellipsis in Bill's
sentence. It should really be understood as:

-   Ann is hiding in the bushes because I might be on that bus.

So in a sense, it isn't a bare epistemic modal; it is in a
'because'-clause. Moreover, suggests Stephenson, we should take
'because'-clauses to express something like a person's conscious
reasoning or rationale. So in this case 'because' acts like an attitude
verb and shift the perspective (or judge) of the epistemic modal. (A
similar move, in response to a similar objection, is defended by John
@MacFarlane2014 [272ff].)

The relativist needs two premises here for the defence to work. The
first is that all these exocentric uses are either in the scope of an
attitude verb, or are in an explanatory context. The second is that it
is fair to treat 'because' as sufficiently like an attitude verb for
these purposes. A contextualist could well object to either assumption.
But even if they grant both assumptions, a contextualist may want to
simply resist the whole line of reasoning. At most what these arguments
about control show is that 'might', and 'tasty', behave rather
differently to other context-sensitive terms. There is nothing
inconsistent about just accepting that as a surprising fact. And given
how radical a thesis relativism seems to many, accepting relativism as
an explanation for these facts about control could well be an excessive
reaction. The issues here have not been worked out in nearly as much
detail as the issues concerning disagreement and retraction, and we are
a long way from having a full accounting of the costs and benefits of
the possible dialectical moves.

[^1]: Strictly speaking, to get MacFarlane's exact view which kinds of
    views are relativist we need to complicate things even more.
    MacFarlane explicitly leaves open the possibility that we have a
    non-indexical contextualist view about some terms, and a relativist
    view about others, and expressly says that such a view is a form of
    relativism. So what we should say is that perspectives are
    sub-divided into those features where the context of utterance is
    relevant for utterance truth, and those where the context of
    assessment is relevant to utterance truth. If the first set of
    features of $p_u$, and the second set is $p_a$, then the utterance
    $U$ of sentence $S$ in context $c_u$ will be true, relative to
    $c_a$, iff $f_S(c_u, w(c_u), p_u(c_u), p_a(c_a)) = TRUE$.
    MacFarlane's own view seems to be that $p_u$ will be empty, so the
    simplified view we've given in the text is a fair representation of
    how he thinks actual natural languages work. But there are possible
    languages where the complications noted here are relevant.
