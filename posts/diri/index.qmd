title: "Defending Interest Relative Invariantism"
description: | 
    Since interest-relative invariantism (hereafter, IRI) was introduced into contemporary epistemology in the early 2000s, it has been criticised on a number of fronts. This paper responds to six different criticisms of IRI launched by five different authors. And it does so by noting that the best version of IRI is immune to the criticisms they have launched. The 'best version' in question notes three things about IRI. First, what matters for knowledge is not strictly the *stakes* the agent faces in any decision-problem, but really the *odds* at which she has to bet. Second, IRI is a relatively weak theory; it just says interests sometimes matter. Defenders of IRI have often derived it from much stronger principles about reasoning, and critics have attacked those principles, but much weaker principles would do. Third, and most importantly, interests matter because generate certain kinds of *defeaters*. It isn't part of this version of IRI that an agent can know something in virtue of their interests. Rather, the theory says that whether a certain kind of consideration is a defeater to an agent's putative knowledge that _p_ depends on their interests. This matters for the intuitive plausibility of IRI. Critics have argued, rightly, that interests don't behave in ways distinctive of grounds of knowledge. But interests do behave like other kinds of defeaters, and this undermines the criticisms of IRI.

In recent years a number of authors have defended the
interest-relativity of knowledge and justification. Views of this form
are floated by John Hawthorne [-@Hawthorne2004], and endorsed by Jeremy
Fantl and Matthew McGrath [-@Fantl2002; -@FantlMcGrath2009], Jason
Stanley [-@Stanley2005-STAKAP] and Brian Weatherson
[-@Weatherson2005-WEACWD]. The various authors differ quite a lot in how
much interest-relativity they allow, but what is common is the defence
of interest-relativity.

These views have, quite naturally, drawn a range of criticisms. The
primary purpose of this paper is to respond to these criticisms and, as
it says on the tin, defend interest-relative invariantism, or IRI for
short. But I don't plan to defend every possible version of IRI, only a
particular one. Most of the critics of IRI have assumed that it must
have some or all of the following features.

1.  It is harder to know things in high-stakes situations than in
    low-stakes situations.

2.  There is an interest-sensitive constituent of knowledge.

3.  IRI stands and falls with some principles connecting knowledge and
    action, such as the principles found in @Hawthorne2008-HAWKAA.

My preferred version of IRI has none of these three features.[^1]

First, it says that knowledge changes when the **odds** an agent faces
change, not when the **stakes** change. More precisely, interests affect
belief because whether someone believes $p$ depends *inter alia* on
whether their credence in $p$ is high enough that any bet on $p$ they
actually face is a good bet. And interests affect knowledge largely
because they affect belief. Raising the stakes of any bet on $p$ does
not directly change whether an agent believes $p$, but changing the odds
of the bets on $p$ they face does change it. In practice raising the
stakes changes the odds due to the declining marginal utility of
material goods. So in practice high-stakes situations are typically
long-odds situations. But knowledge is hard in those situations because
they are long-odds situations, not because they are high-stakes
situations.

So my version of IRI says that knowledge differs between these two
cases.

High Cost Map:

:   Zeno is walking to the Mysterious Bookshop in lower Manhattan. He's
    pretty confident that it's on the corner of Warren Street and West
    Broadway. But he's been confused about this in the past, forgetting
    whether the east-west street is Warren or Murray, and whether the
    north-south street is Greenwich, West Broadway or Church. In fact
    he's right about the location this time, but he isn't justified in
    having a credence in his being correct greater than about 0.95.
    While he's walking there, he has two options. He could walk to where
    he thinks the shop is, and if it's not there walk around for a few
    minutes to the nearby corners to find where it is. Or he could call
    up directory assistance, pay \$1, and be told where the shop is.
    Since he's confident he knows where the shop is, and there's little
    cost to spending a few minutes walking around if he's wrong, he
    doesn't do this, and walks directly to the shop.

Low Cost Map:

:   Just like the previous case, except that Zeno has a new phone with
    more options. In particular, his new phone has a searchable map, so
    with a few clicks on the phone he can find where the store is. Using
    the phone has some very small costs. For example, it distracts him a
    little, which marginally raises the likelihood of bumping into
    another pedestrian. But the cost is very small compared to the cost
    of getting the location wrong. So even though he is very confident
    about where the shop is, he double checks while walking there.

I think the Map Cases are like the various cases that have been used to
motivate interest-relativity[^2] in all important respects. I think Zeno
knows where the shop is in High Cost Map, and doesn't know in Low Cost
Map. And he doesn't know in Low Cost Map because the location of the
shop has suddenly become the subject matter of a bet at very long odds.
You should think of Zeno's not checking the location of the shop on his
phone-map as a bet on the location of the shop. If he wins the bet, he
wins a few seconds of undistracted strolling. If he loses, he has to
walk around a few blocks looking for a store. The disutility of the loss
seems easily twenty times greater than the utility of the gain, and by
hypothesis the probability of winning the bet is no greater than 0.95.
So he shouldn't take the bet. Yet if he knew where the store was, he
would be justified in taking the bet. So he doesn't know where the store
is. Now this is not a case where higher *stakes* defeat knowledge. If
anything, the stakes are lower in Low Cost Map. But the relevant odds
are longer, and that's what matters to knowledge.

Second, on this version of IRI, interests matter because there are
interest-sensitive defeaters, not because interests form any kind of new
condition on knowledge, alongside truth, justification, belief and so
on. In particular, interests matter because there are interest-relative
coherence constraints on knowledge. Some coherence constraints, I claim,
are not interest-relative. If an agent believes $\neg p$, that belief
defeats her purported knowledge that $p$, even if the belief that $p$ is
true, justified, safe, sensitive and so on. It is tempting to try to
posit a further coherence condition.

Practical Coherence

:   An agent does not know that $p$ if she prefers $\varphi$ to $\psi$
    unconditionally, but prefers $\psi$ to $\varphi$ conditional on $p$.

But that is too strong. For reasons similar to those gone over at the
start of @Hawthorne2004, it would mean we know nearly nothing. A more
plausible condition is:

Relevant Practical Coherence

:   An agent does not know that $p$ if she prefers $\varphi$ to $\psi$
    unconditionally, but prefers $\psi$ to $\varphi$ conditional on $p$,
    for any $\varphi, \psi$ that are relevant given her interests.

When this condition is violated, the agent's claim to knowledge is
defeated. As we'll see below, defeaters behave rather differently to
constituents of knowledge. Some things which could not plausibly be
grounds for knowledge could be defeaters to defeaters for knowledge.

**Relevant Practical Coherence** suffices, at least among agents who are
trying to maximise expected value, to generate an interest-relativity to
knowledge. The general structure of the case should be familiar from the
existing literature. Let $p$ be a proposition that is true, believed by
the agent, and strongly but not quite conclusively supported by their
evidence. Let $B$ be a bet that has a small positive return if $p$, and
a huge negative return if $\neg p$. Assume the agent is now offered the
bet, and let $\varphi$ be declining the bet, and $\psi$ be accepting the
bet. Conditional on $p$, the bet wins, so the agent prefers the small
positive payout, so prefers $\psi$ to $\varphi$ conditional on $p$. But
the bet has a massively negative expected return, so unconditionally the
agent does not want it. That is, unconditionally she prefers $\varphi$
to $\psi$. Once the bet is offered, the actions $\varphi$ and $\psi$
become relevant given her interests, so by **Relevant Practical
Coherence** she no longer knows $p$. So for such an agent, knowledge is
interest-relative.

Cases where knowledge is defeated because if the agent did know $p$,
that would lead to problems elsewhere in their cognitive system, have a
few quirky features. In particular, whether the agent knows $p$ can
depend on very distant features. Consider the following kind of case.

>

>     know that $p$?

I think the answer to the first question is *No*, and the answer to the
second question is *Yes*. As it stands, Con's disposition to affirm the
consequent is a doxastic defeater of his putative knowledge that $p$.
Put another way, $p$ doesn't cohere well enough with the rest of Con's
views for his belief that $p$ to count as knowledge. To be sure, $p$
coheres well enough with those beliefs by objective standards, but it
doesn't cohere at all by Con's lights. Until he changes those lights, it
doesn't cohere well enough to be knowledge. Moreover (as a referee
pointed out), Con's belief is not safe. Since he could easily have
'reasoned' himself out of his belief that $p$, the belief isn't safe in
the way that knowledge is safe.

I think that beliefs which violate **Relevant Practical Coherence** fail
to be knowledge for the same reason that Con's belief that $p$ fails to
be knowledge. In what follows, I'll make frequent use of this analogy;
many of the objections to IRI turn out to be equally strong objections
to the view that there are ever defeaters of the type Con suffers from.

This suggests our third point. This version of IRI does not take IRI to
be a consequence of more general principles about knowledge and action.
It simply says that there exist at least one pair of cases where the
only relevant difference between agents in the two cases concerns their
interests, but one knows that $p$ and the other does not.[^3] I happen
to think that most of the general principles that philosophers have used
to try to derive IRI are false. But since IRI is much weaker than those
principles, that is no reason to conclude IRI is false.[^4]

The existence of interest-relativity is then quite a weak claim. There
are plenty of stronger claims in the area we could make. I prefer, for
instance, a version of IRI where being offered bets like $B$ defeats
knowledge that $p$ even if the agent does not have the preferences I
ascribed above. (That could be because she isn't trying to maximise
expected value, or because she's messed up the expected value
calculations.) But knowledge could be interest-relative even if I'm
wrong about those cases.

So I've set out a version of IRI that lacks three features often
attributed to IRI. I haven't argued for that theory here - I do that at
much greater length in (Author Paper 1). But I hope I've done enough to
convince you that the theory is both a version of IRI, and not obviously
false. In what follows, I'll argue that the theory is immune to the
various challenges to IRI that have been put forward in the literature.
This immunity is, I think, a strong reason to prefer this version of
IRI.

#  Experimental Objections {#sect:xphi}

I don't place as much weight as some philosophers do on the correlation
between the verdicts of an epistemological theory and the gut reactions
that non-experts have to tricky cases. And I don't think the best cases
for IRI relies on such a correlation holding. The best case for IRI is
that it integrates nicely with an independently supported theory of
belief, and that it lets us keep a number of plausible principles
without drifting into skepticism.[^5] But still, it is nice to not have
one's theory saying exorbitantly counterintuitive things. Various
experimental results, such as the results in @May2010 and
@FeltzZarpentine2010, might be thought to suggest that IRI does have
consequences which are counterintuitive, or which at least run counter
to the intuitions of some experimental subjects. I'm going to
concentrate on the latter set of results here, though I think that what
I say will generalise to related experimental work. In fact, I think the
experiments don't really tell against IRI, because IRI, at least in my
preferred version, doesn't make *any* unambiguous predictions about the
cases at the centre of the experiments. The reason for this is related
to my insistence that we concentrate on the odds an agent faces, not the
stakes she faces.

Feltz and Zarpentine gave subjects related vignettes, such as the
following pair. (Each subject only received one of the pair.)

High Stakes Bridge

:   John is driving a truck along a dirt road in a caravan of trucks. He
    comes across what looks like a rickety wooden bridge over a yawning
    thousand foot drop. He radios ahead to find out whether other trucks
    have made it safely over. He is told that all 15 trucks in the
    caravan made it over without a problem. John reasons that if they
    made it over, he will make it over as well. So, he thinks to
    himself, 'I know that my truck will make it across the bridge.'

Low Stakes Bridge

:   John is driving a truck along a dirt road in a caravan of trucks. He
    comes across what looks like a rickety wooden bridge over a three
    foot ditch. He radios ahead to find out whether other trucks have
    made it safely over. He is told that all 15 trucks in the caravan
    made it over without a problem. John reasons that if they made it
    over, he will make it over as well. So, he thinks to himself, 'I
    know that my truck will make it across the bridge.'
    [@FeltzZarpentine2010 696]

Subjects were asked to evaluate John's thought. And the result was that
27% of the participants said that John does not know that the truck will
make it across in **Low Stakes Bridge**, while 36% said he did not know
this in **High Stakes Bridge**. Feltz and Zarpentine say that these
results should be bad for interest-relativity views. But it is hard to
see just why this is so.

Note that the change in the judgments between the cases goes in the
direction that IRI seems to predict. The change isn't trivial, even if
due to the smallish sample size it isn't statistically significant in
this sample. But should a view like IRI have predicted a larger change?
To figure this out, we need to ask three questions.

1.  What are the costs of the bridge collapsing in the two cases?

2.  What are the costs of not taking the bet, i.e., not driving across
    the bridge?

3.  What is the rational credence to have in the bridge's sturdiness
    given the evidence John has?

Conditional on the bridge not collapsing, the drivers presumably prefer
taking the bridge to not taking it. And the actions of taking the bridge
or going around the long way are relevant. So by **Relevant Practical
Coherence**, the drivers know the bridge will not collapse in Low Stakes
Bridge but not High Stakes Bridge if the following equation is true. (I
assume all the other conditions for knowledge are met, and that there
are no other salient instances of Relevant Practical Coherence to
consider.)

$$\frac{C_H}{G + C_H} > x > \frac{C_L}{G + C_L}$$

where $G$ is the gain the driver gets from taking a non-collapsing
bridge rather than driving around (or whatever the alternative is),
$C_H$ is the cost of being on a collapsing bridge in High Stakes Bridge,
$C_L$ is the cost of being on a collapsing bridge in Low Stakes Bridge,
and $x$ is the probability that the bridge will collapse. I assume $x$
is constant between the two cases. If that equation holds, then taking
the bridge, i.e., acting as if the bridge won't collapse, maximises
expected utility in Low Stakes Bridge but not High Stakes Bridge. So in
High Stakes Bridge, adding the proposition that the bridge won't
collapse to the agent's cognitive system produces incoherence, since the
agent won't (at least rationally) act as if the bridge won't collapse.
So if the equation holds, the agent's interests in avoiding $C_H$
creates a doxastic defeater in High Stakes Bridge.

But does the equation hold? Or, more relevantly, did the subjects of the
experiment believe that the equation hold? None of the four variables
has their values clearly entailed by the story, so we have to guess a
little as to what the subjects' views would be.

Feltz and Zarpentine say that the costs in "High Stakes Bridge are
very costly---certain death---whereas the costs in Low Stakes Bridge are
likely some minor injuries and embarrassment." [@FeltzZarpentine2010
702] I suspect both of those claims are wrong, or at least not
universally believed. A lot more people survive bridge collapses than
you may expect, even collapses from a great height.[^6] And once the
road below a truck collapses, all sorts of things can go wrong, even if
the next bit of ground is only 3 feet away. (For instance, if the bridge
collapses unevenly, the truck could roll, and the driver would probably
suffer more than minor injuries.)

We aren't given any information as to the costs of not crossing the
bridge. But given that 15 other trucks, with less evidence than John,
have decided to cross the bridge, it seems plausible to think they are
substantial. If there was an easy way to avoid the bridge, presumably
the *first* truck would have taken it. If $G$ is large enough, and $C_H$
small enough, then the only way for this equation to hold will be for
$x$ to be low enough that we'd have independent reason to say that the
driver doesn't know the bridge will hold.

But what is the value of $x$? John has a lot of information that the
bridge will support his truck. If I've tested something for sturdiness
two or three times, and it has worked, I won't even think about testing
it again. Consider what evidence you need before you'll happily stand on
a particular chair to reach something in the kitchen, or put a heavy
television on a stand. Supporting a weight is the kind of thing that
either fails the first time, or works fairly reliably. Obviously there
could be some strain-induced effects that cause a subsequent
failure[^7], but John really has a lot of evidence that the bridge will
support him.

Given those three answers, it seems to me that it is a reasonable bet to
cross the bridge. At the very least, it's no more of an unreasonable bet
than the bet I make every day crossing a busy highway by foot. So I'm
not surprised that 64% of the subjects agreed that John knew the bridge
would hold him. At the very least, that result is perfectly consistent
with IRI, if we make plausible assumptions about how the subjects would
answer the three numbered questions above.

And as I've stressed, these experiments are only a problem for IRI if
the subjects are reliable. I can think of two reasons why they might not
be. First, subjects tend to massively discount the costs and likelihoods
of traffic related injuries. In most of the country, the risk of death
or serious injury through motor vehicle accident is much higher than the
risk of death or serious injury through some kind of crime or other
attack, yet most people do much less to prevent vehicles harming them
than they do to prevent criminals or other attackers harming them.[^8]
Second, only 73% of these subjects in *this very experiment* said that
John knows the bridge will support him in **Low Stakes Bridge**. This is
rather striking. Unless the subjects endorse an implausible kind of
scepticism, something has gone wrong with the experimental design. But
if the subjects are implausibly sceptical, then we shouldn't require our
epistemological theory to track their gut reactions. (And if something
has gone wrong with the experimental design, then obviously can't be
used as the basis for any objection.) So given the fact that the
experiment points broadly in the direction of IRI, and that with some
plausible assumptions it is perfectly consistent with that theory, and
that the subjects seem unreasonably sceptical to the point of
unreliability about epistemology, I don't think this kind of
experimental work threatens IRI.

#  Knowledge By Indifference and By Wealth

Gillian Russell and John Doris [-@RussellDoris2008] argue that Jason
Stanley's account of knowledge leads to some implausible attributions of
knowledge, and if successful their objections would generalise to other
forms of IRI. I'm going to argue that Russell and Doris's objections
turn on principles that are *prima facie* rather plausible, but which
ultimately we can reject for independent reasons.[^9]

Their objection relies on variants of the kind of case Stanley uses
heavily in his [-@Stanley2005-STAKAP] to motivate a pragmatic constraint
on knowledge. Stanley considers the kinds of cases we used to derive IRI
from **Relevant Practical Coherence**. So imagine an agent who faces a
choice between accepting the status quo, call that $\varphi$, and taking
some giant risk, call that $\psi$. The giant risk in this case will
involve a huge monetary loss if $\neg p$, and a small non-monetary gain
if $p$. Stanley says, and I agree, that in such a case the agent doesn't
know $p$, even if their belief in $p$ is true, well supported by
evidence, and so on. Moreover, he says, had $\psi$ not been a relevant
option, the agent could have known $p$. I agree, and I think **Relevant
Practical Coherence** explains these intuitions well.

Russell and Doris imagine two kinds of variants on Stanley's case. In
one variant the agent doesn't care about the material loss associated
with $\psi \wedge \neg p$. As I would put it, although their material
wealth would decline precipitously in that case, their utility would
not, because their utility is not tightly correlated with material
wellbeing. Given that, the agent may well prefer $\psi$ to $\varphi$
unconditionally, and so would still know $p$. Russell and Doris don't
claim this is a problem in itself, but they do think the conjunction of
this with the previous paragraph is a problem. As they put it, "you
should have reservations \... about what makes the knowledge claim
true: not giving a damn, however enviable in other respects, should not
be knowledge-making." [@RussellDoris2008 432].

Their other variant involves an agent with so much money that the
material loss is trifling to them. Since the difference in utility
between having, say, eight billion dollars and seven billion dollars is
not that high, perhaps they will again prefer $\psi$ to $\varphi$
unconditionally, so still know $p$. But it is, allegedly,
counterintuitive to have the knowledge that $p$ turn on the agent's
wealth. As Russell and Doris say, "matters are now even dodgier for
practical interest accounts, because *money* turns out to be knowledge
making." [@RussellDoris2008 433] And this isn't just because wealth can
purchase knowledge. As they say, "money may buy the *instruments* of
knowledge \... but here the connection between money and knowledge seems
rather too direct." [@RussellDoris2008 433]

The first thing to note about this case is that indifference and wealth
aren't really producing knowledge. What they are doing is more like
defeating a defeater. Remember that the agent in question had enough
evidence, and enough confidence, that they would know $p$ were it not
for the practical circumstances. As I said in the introduction,
practical considerations enter debates about knowledge in part because
they are distinctive kinds of defeaters. It seems that's what is going
on here. And we have, somewhat surprisingly, independent evidence to
think that indifference and wealth do matter to defeaters.

Consider two variants on Gilbert Harman's 'dead dictator' example
[@Harman1973 75]. In the original example, an agent reads that the
dictator has died through an actually reliable source. But there are
many other news sources around, such that if the agent read them, she
would lose her belief. Even if the agent doesn't read those sources,
their presence can constitute defeaters to her putative knowledge that
the dictator died.

In our first variant on Harman's example, the agent simply does not care
about politics. It's true that there are many other news sources around
that are ready to mislead her about the dictator's demise. But she has
no interest in looking them up, nor is she at all likely to look them
up. She mostly cares about literature, and will spend her day reading
old novels. In this case, the misleading news sources are too distant,
in a sense, to be defeaters. So she still knows the dictator has died.
Her indifference towards politics doesn't generate knowledge - the
original reliable report is the knowledge generator - but her
indifference means that a would-be defeater doesn't gain traction.

It might be objected here that the agent doesn't know the dictator has
died because there are misleading reports around saying the dictator is
alive, and she is in no position to rebut them. But this is too high a
standard for knowledge. There are millions of people in Australia who
know that humans are contributing to global warming on purely
testimonial grounds. Many, perhaps even most, of these people would not
be able to answer a carefully put together argument that humans are not
contributing to global warming, such as an argument that picked various
outlying statistics to mislead the reader. And such arguments certainly
exist; the conservative parts of the media do as much as they can to
play them up. But the mere existence of such arguments doesn't defeat
the average person's testimonial knowledge about anthropogenic global
warming. Similarly, the mere existence of misleading reports does not
defeat our agent's knowledge of the dictator's death, as long as there
is no nearby world where she is exposed to the reports. (Thanks here to
an anonymous referee.)

In the second variant, the agent cares deeply about politics, and has
masses of wealth at hand to ensure that she knows a lot about it. Were
she to read the misleading reports that the dictator has survived, then
she would simply use some of the very expensive sources she has to get
more reliable reports. Again this suffices for the misleading reports
not to be defeaters. Even before the rich agent exercises her wealth,
the fact that her wealth gives her access to reports that will correct
for misleading reports means that the misleading reports are not
actually defeaters. So with her wealth she knows things she wouldn't
otherwise know, even before her money goes to work. Again, her money
doesn't generate knowledge -- the original reliable report is the
knowledge generator -- but her wealth means that a would-be defeater
doesn't gain traction.

The same thing is true in Russell and Doris's examples. The agent has
quite a bit of evidence that $p$. That's why she knows $p$. There's a
potential practical defeater for $p$. But due to either indifference or
wealth, the defeater is immunised. Surprisingly perhaps, indifference
and/or wealth can be the difference between knowledge and ignorance. But
that's not because they can be in any interesting sense 'knowledge
makers', any more than I can make a bowl of soup by preventing someone
from tossing it out. Rather, they can be things that block defeaters,
both when the defeaters are the kind Stanley talks about, and when they
are more familiar kinds of defeaters.

#  Temporal Embeddings {#sect:time}

Michael @MBT2009 has argued that tense-shifted knowledge ascriptions can
be used to show that his version of Lewisian contextualism is preferable
to IRI. Like Russell and Doris, his argument uses a variant of Stanley's
Bank Cases.[^10] Let $O$ be that the bank is open Saturday morning. If
Hannah has a large debt, she is in a high-stakes situation with respect
to $O$. In Blome-Tillmann's version of the example, Hannah had in fact
incurred a large debt, but on Friday morning the creditor waived this
debt. Hannah had no way of anticipating this on Thursday. She has some
evidence for $O$, but not enough for knowledge if she's in a high-stakes
situation. Blome-Tillmann says that this means after Hannah discovers
the debt waiver, she could say

(1) I didn't know $O$ on Thursday, but on
    Friday I did.

But I'm not sure why this case should be problematic for any version of
IRI, and very unsure why it should even look like a *reductio* of IRI.
As Blome-Tillmann notes, it isn't really a situation where Hannah's
stakes change. She was never actually in a high stakes situation. At
most her perception of her stakes change; she thought she was in a
high-stakes situation, then realised that she wasn't. Blome-Tillmann
argues that even this change in perceived stakes can be enough to make
(1) true if IRI is true. Now actually I
agree that this change in perception could be enough to make
(1) true, but when we work through the
reason that's so, we'll see that it isn't because of anything
distinctive, let alone controversial, about IRI.

If Hannah is rational, then given her interests she won't be ignoring
$\neg O$ possibilities on Thursday. She'll be taking them into account
in her plans. Someone who is anticipating $\neg O$ possibilities, and
making plans for them, doesn't know $O$. That's not a distinctive claim
of IRI. Any theory should say that if a person is worrying about
$\neg O$ possibilities, and planning around them, they don't know $O$.
And that's simply because knowledge requires a level of confidence that
such a person simply does not show. If Hannah is rational, that will
describe her on Thursday, but not on Friday. So
(1) is true not because Hannah's practical
situation changes between Thursday and Friday, but because her
psychological state changes, and psychological states are relevant to
knowledge.

What if Hannah is, on Thursday, irrationally ignoring $\neg O$
possibilities, and not planning for them even though her rational self
wishes she were planning for them? In that case, it seems she still
believes $O$. After all, she makes the same decisions as she would as if
$O$ were sure to be true. But it's worth remembering that if Hannah does
irrationally ignore $\neg O$ possibilities, she is being irrational with
respect to $O$. And it's very plausible that this irrationality defeats
knowledge. That is, you can't be irrational with respect to a
proposition and know it. Irrationality excludes knowledge. In any case,
I doubt this is the natural way to read Blome-Tillmann's example. We
naturally read Hannah as being rational, and if she is rational she
won't have the right kind of confidence to count as knowing $O$ on
Thursday.

There's a methodological point here worth stressing. Doing epistemology
with imperfect agents often results in facing tough choices, where any
way to describe a case feels a little counterintuitive. If we simply hew
to intuitions, we risk being led astray by just focussing on the first
way a puzzle case is described to us. But once we think through Hannah's
case, we see perfectly good reasons, independent of IRI, to endorse
IRI's prediction about the case.

#  Problematic Conjunctions {#sect:conj}

Blome-Tillmann offers another argument against IRI, that makes heavy use
of the notion of having enough evidence to know something. Here is how
he puts the argument. (Again I've changed the numbering and some
terminology for consistency with this paper.)

> Suppose that John and Paul have exactly the same evidence, while John
> is in a low-stakes situation towards $p$ and Paul in a high-stakes
> situation towards $p$. Bearing in mind that IRI is the view that

>
> [@MBT2009 328-9]

And this is meant to be a problem, because
(2) is
intuitively false.

But IRI doesn't entail any such thing. We can see this by looking at a
simpler example that illustrates the way 'enough' works.

George and Ringo both have \$6000 in their bank accounts. They both are
thinking about buying a new computer, which would cost \$2000. Both of
them also have rent due tomorrow, and they won't get any more money
before then. George lives in New York, so his rent is \$5000. Ringo
lives in Syracuse, so his rent is \$1000. Clearly,
(REC) and
(RAC) are true.

REC
:    Ringo has enough money to buy the computer.

RAC
:    Ringo can afford the computer.

And (GEC) is true as
well, though there's at least a reading of
(GAC) where it is
false.

GEC
:    George has enough money to buy the computer.

GAC
:    George can afford the computer.

Focus for now on (GEC). It is a bad idea for George to buy the computer; he
won't be able to pay his rent. But he has enough money to do so; the
computer costs \$2000, and he has \$6000 in the bank. So
(GEC) is true.
Admittedly there are things close to
(GEC) that aren't
true. He hasn't got enough money to buy the computer and pay his rent.
You might say that he hasn't got enough money to buy the computer given
his other financial obligations. But none of this undermines
(GEC).

Now just like George has enough money to buy the computer, Paul has
enough evidence to know that $p$. Paul can't know that $p$, just like
George can't buy the computer, because of his practical situation. But
that doesn't mean he doesn't have enough evidence to know it. He clearly
does have enough evidence, since he has the same evidence John has, and
John knows that $p$. So, contra Blome-Tillmann, IRI doesn't entail this
problematic conjunction.

In a footnote attached to this, Blome-Tillmann offers a reformulation of
the argument.

> I take it that having enough evidence to 'know $p$' in $C$ just means
> having evidence such that one is in a position to 'know $p$' in $C$,
> rather than having evidence such that one 'knows $p$'. Thus, another
> way to formulate (2) would be as follows: 'John and Paul have exactly
> the same evidence for $p$, but only John is in a position to know $p$,
> Paul isn't.' [@MBT2009 329n23]

Now having enough evidence to know $p$ isn't the same as being in a
position to know it, any more than having enough money to buy the
computer puts George in a position to buy it. So I think this is more of
a new objection than a reformulation of the previous point. But might it
be a *stronger* objection? Might it be that IRI entails
(PosK), which is
false?

PosK
:   John and Paul have exactly the same
    evidence for $p$, but only John is in a position to know $p$, Paul
    isn't.

Actually, it isn't a problem that IRI says that
(PosK) is true. In
fact, almost any epistemological theory will imply that conjunctions
like that are true. In particular, any epistemological theory that
allows for the existence of defeaters which do not supervene on the
possession of evidence will imply that conjunctions like
(PosK) are true. For
example, anyone who thinks that whether you can know that a barn-like
structure is really a barn depends on whether there are non-barns in the
neighbourhood that look like the structure you're looking at will think
that conjunctions like (PosK) are true. Again, it matters a lot that IRI is
suggesting that traditional epistemologists did not notice that there
are distinctively pragmatic defeaters. Once we see that, we'll see that
conjunctions like (PosK) are not surprising at all.

Consider again Con, and his friend Mod who is disposed to reason by
modus ponens and not by affirming the consequent. We could say that Con
and Mod have the same evidence for $p$, but only Mod is in a position to
know $p$. There are only two ways to deny that conjunction. One is to
interpret 'position to know' so broadly that Con is in a position to
know $p$ because he could change his inferential dispositions. But then
we might as well say that Paul is in a position to know $p$ because he
could get into a different 'stakes' situation. Alternatively, we could
say that Con's inferential dispositions count as a kind of evidence
against $p$. But that stretches the notion of evidence beyond a breaking
point. Note that we didn't say Con had any *reason* to affirm the
consequent, just that he does. Someone might adopt, or change, a poor
inferential habit because they get new evidence. But they need not do
so, and we shouldn't count their inferential habits as evidence they
have.

If that case is not convincing, we can make the same point with a simple
Gettier-style case.

In that story, I think it is clear that Agnetha and Anni-Frid have
exactly the same evidence that the job will go to someone Swedish, but
only Agnetha is in a position to know this, Anni-Frid is not. The fact
that an intermediate step is false in Anni-Frid's reasoning, but not
Agnetha's, means that Anni-Frid's putative knowledge is defeated, but
Agnetha's is not. And when that happens, we can have differences in
knowledge without differences in evidence. So it isn't an argument
against IRI that it allows differences in knowledge without differences
in evidence.

#  Holism and Defeaters {#sect:holism}

The big lesson of the last few sections is that interests create
defeaters. Sometimes an agent can't know $p$ because adding $p$ to her
stock of beliefs would introduce either incoherence or irrationality.
The reason is normally that the agent faces some decision where it is,
say, bad to do $\varphi$, but good to do $\varphi$ given $p$. In that
situation, if she adds $p$, she'll either incoherently think that it's
bad to do $\varphi$ although it's good to do it given what is (by her
lights) true. Moreover, the IRI theorist says, being incoherent in this
way blocks knowledge, so the agent doesn't know $p$.

But there are other, more roundabout, ways in which interests can mean
that believing $p$ would entail incoherence. One of these is illustrated
by an example alleged by Ram Neta to be hard for interest-relative
theorists to accommodate.

> Kate needs to get to Main Street by noon: her life depends upon it.
> She is desperately searching for Main Street when she comes to an
> intersection and looks up at the perpendicular street signs at that
> intersection. One street sign says "State Street" and the
> perpendicular street sign says "Main Street." Now, it is a matter of
> complete indifference to Kate whether she is on State Street--nothing

Let's assume for now that Kate is rational; dropping this assumption
introduces mostly irrelevant complications. That is, we will assume Kate
is an expected utility maximiser. Kate will not believe she's on Main
Street. She would only have that belief if she took it to be settled
that she's on Main, and hence not worthy of spending further effort
investigating. But presumably she won't do that. The rational thing for
her to do is to get confirming (or, if relevant, confounding) evidence
for the appearance that she's on Main. If it were settled that she was
on Main, the rational thing to do would be to try to relax, and be
grateful that she had found Main Street. Since she has different
attitudes about what to do *simpliciter* and conditional on being on
Main Street, she doesn't believe she's on Main Street.

So far so good, but what about her attitude towards the proposition that
she's on State Street? She has enough evidence for that proposition that
her credence in it should be rather high. And no practical issues turn
on whether she is on State. So she believes she is on State, right?

Not so fast! Believing that she's on State has more connections to her
cognitive system than just producing actions. Note in particular that
street signs are hardly basic epistemic sources. They are the kind of
evidence we should be 'conservative' about in the sense of
@Pryor2004-PRYWWW. We should only use them if we antecedently believe
they are correct. So for Kate to believe she's on State, she'd have to
believe the street signs she can see are correct. If not, she'd
incoherently be relying on a source she doesn't trust, even though it is
not a basic source.[^11] But if she believes the street signs are
correct, she'd believe she was on Main, and that would lead to practical
incoherence. So there's no way to coherently add the belief that she's
on State Street to her stock of beliefs. So she doesn't know, and can't
know, that she's either on State or on Main. This is, in a roundabout
way, due to the high stakes Kate faces.

Neta thinks that the best way for the interest-relative theorist to
handle this case is to say that the high stakes associated with the
proposition that Kate is on Main Street imply that certain methods of
belief formation do not produce knowledge. And he argues, plausibly,
that such a restriction will lead to implausibly sceptical results. But
that's not the only way for the interest-relative theorist to go. What
they could, and I think should, say is that Kate can't know she's on
State Street because the only grounds for that belief are intimately
connected to a proposition that, in virtue of her interests, she needs
very large amounts of evidence to believe.

#  Non-Consequentialist Cases

None of the replies yet have leaned heavily on the last of the three
points from the introduction, the fact that IRI is an existential claim.
This reply will make heavy use of that fact.

If an agent is merely trying to get the best outcome for themselves,
then it makes sense to represent them as a utility maximiser. But when
agents have to make decisions that might involve them causing harm to
others if certain propositions turn out to be true, then I think it is
not so clear that orthodox decision theory is the appropriate way to
model the agents. That's relevant to cases like this one, which Jessica
Brown has argued are problematic for the epistemological theories John
Hawthorne and Jason Stanley have recently been defending.[^12]

It is tempting, but I think mistaken, to represent the payoff table
associated with the surgeon's choice as follows. Let **Left** mean the
left kidney is diseased, and **Right** mean the right kidney is
diseased.

::: {.center}
  ------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
                                **Left**          **Right**
     **Remove left kidney**        $1$              $-1$
    **Remove right kidney**       $-1$               $1$
            **Check notes**  $1-\varepsilon$   $1-\varepsilon$
  ------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
:::

Here $\varepsilon$ is the trivial but non-zero cost of checking the
chart. Given this table, we might reason that since the surgeon knows
that she's in the left column, and removing the left kidney is the best
option in that column, she should remove the left kidney rather than
checking the notes.

But that reasoning assumes that the surgeon does not have any
obligations over and above her duty to maximise expected utility. And
that's very implausible, since consequentialism is a fairly implausible
theory of medical ethics.[^13]

It's not clear exactly what obligation the surgeon has. Perhaps it is an
obligation to not just know which kidney to remove, but to know this on
the basis of evidence she has obtained while in the operating theatre.
Or perhaps it is an obligation to make her belief about which kidney to
remove as sensitive as possible to various possible scenarios. Before
she checked the chart, this counterfactual was false: *Had she
misremembered which kidney was to be removed, she would have a true
belief about which kidney was to be removed.* Checking the chart makes
that counterfactual true, and so makes her belief that the left kidney
is to be removed a little more sensitive to counterfactual
possibilities.

However we spell out the obligation, it is plausible given what the
nurse says that the surgeon has some such obligation. And it is
plausible that the 'cost' of violating this obligation, call it
$\delta$, is greater than the cost of checking the notes. So here is the
decision table the surgeon faces.

::: {.center}
  ------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
                                **Left**          **Right**
     **Remove left kidney**    $1-\delta$        $-1-\delta$
    **Remove right kidney**    $-1-\delta$       $1-\delta$
            **Check notes**  $1-\varepsilon$   $1-\varepsilon$
  ------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
:::

And it isn't surprising, or a problem for an interest-relative theory of
knowledge, that the surgeon should check the notes, even if she believes
*and knows* that the left kidney is the diseased one. This is not to say
that the surgeon does know that the left kidney is diseased, just that
the version of IRI being defended here is neutral on that question.

There is a very general point here. It suffices to derive IRI that we
defend principles like the following:

-   Whenever maximising expected value is called for, one should
    maximise expected value conditional on everything one knows.

-   Maximising expected value is called for often enough that there
    exist the kinds of pairs of cases IRI claims exist. That's because
    in some cases, changing the options facing an agent will make it the
    case that which live option is best differs from which live option
    is best given $p$, even though the agent antecedently knew $p$.

But that doesn't imply that maximising expected value is always called
for. Especially in a medical case, it is hard to square an injunction
like "Do No Harm!" with a view that one should maximise expected value,
since maximising expected value requires treating harms and benefits
symmetrically. What would be a problem for the version of IRI defended
here was a case with the following four characteristics.

-   Maximising expected value is called for in the case.

-   Conditional on $p$, the action with the highest expected value is
    $\varphi$.

-   It would be wrong to do $\varphi$.

-   The agent knows $p$.

It is tempting for the proponent of IRI to resist any attempted
counterexample by claiming it is not really a case of knowledge. That
might be the right thing to say in Brown's case. But IRI defenders
should remember that it is often a good move to deny that the first
condition holds. Consequentialism is not an obviously correct theory of
decision making in morally fraught situations; purported counterexamples
that rely on it can therefore be resisted.

[^1]: It is a tricky exegetical question how many of the three features
    here must be read into defences of IRI in the literature. My reading
    is that they do not have to be read in, so it is not overly original
    of me to defend a version of IRI that does away with all three. But
    I know many people disagree with that. If they're right, this paper
    is more original than I think it is, and so I'm rather happy to be
    wrong. But I'm going to mostly set these exegetical issues aside,
    and compare different theories without taking a stand on who
    originally promulgated them.

[^2]: Such as the Bank Cases in @Stanley2005-STAKAP, or the Train Cases
    in @Fantl2002.

[^3]: And this is true even though $p$ is not a proposition about their
    interests, or something that is supported by propositions about
    their interests, and so on.

[^4]: I will consider, and tentatively support, one principle stronger
    than IRI in the final section. But the key point is that these
    general principles are not needed to defend IRI.

[^5]: This points are expanded upon greatly in (Author Paper 1).

[^6]: In the West Gate bridge collapse in Melbourne in 1971, a large
    number of the victims were underneath the bridge; the people on top
    of the bridge had a non-trivial chance of survival. That bridge was
    200 feet above the water, not 1000, but I'm not sure the extra
    height would matter greatly. Again from a slightly lower height,
    over 90% of people on the bridge survived the I-35W collapse in
    Minneapolis in 2007.

[^7]: As I believe was the case in the I-35W collapse.

[^8]: See the massive drop in the numbers of students walking or biking
    to school, reported in @Ham2008, for a sense of how big an issue
    this is.

[^9]: I think the objections I make here are similar in spirit to those
    Stanley made in a comments thread on [Certain
    Doubts](http://el-prod.baylor.edu/certain_doubts/?p=616), though the
    details are new. The thread is at
    <http://el-prod.baylor.edu/certain_doubts/?p=616>.

[^10]: In the interests of space, I won't repeat those cases yet again
    here.

[^11]: The caveats here about basic sources are to cancel any suggestion
    that Kate has to antecedently believe that any source is reliable
    before she uses it. As @Pryor2000-PRYTSA notes, that view is
    problematic. The view that we only get knowledge from a street sign
    if we antecedently have reason to trust it is not so implausible.

[^12]: The target here is not directly the interest-relativity of their
    theories, but more general principles about the role of knowledge in
    action and assertion. But it's important to see how IRI handles the
    cases that Brown discusses, since these cases are among the
    strongest challenges that have been raised to IRI.

[^13]: I'm not saying that consequentialism is wrong as a theory of
    medical ethics. But if it is right, so many intuitions about medical
    ethics are going to be mistaken that such intuitions have no
    evidential force. And Brown's argument relies on intuitions about
    this case having evidential value. So I think for her argument to
    work, we have to suppose non-consequentialism about medical ethics.
