title: "Most Cited Articles at the Time"
abstract: |
  Imagine people at different times over the past half-century asking the following question: What philosophy journal article, published less than ten years ago, has the most citations in philosophy journals? That's a pretty good operationalisation of the question, what current philosophy work are philosophers talking about the most. It isn't a great guide to what the best work is, or what the most important work will turn out to be, but it does say something important about how philosophy felt at different times. In this note I run through some data on that question.

Imagine people at different times over the past half-century asking the following question: _What philosophy journal article, published less than ten years ago, has the most citations in philosophy journals?_ That's a pretty good operationalisation of the question, what current philosophy work are philosophers talking about the most. It isn't a great guide to what the best work is, or what the most important work will turn out to be, but it does say something important about how philosophy felt at different times. In this note I run through some data on that question.

I'm using the data I described in [this note](https://brian.weatherson.org/quarto/posts/citations/raw-data/citations.html), and I won't repeat it here. The short version is that I'm using Web of Science data, restricted to one hundred philosophy journals, and with one notable exception looking at entries in their database where there is an index reference for both the article being cited, and the article doing the citing. The exception is that I used other data from Web of Science to make up for one important missing slice of their data: _Journal of Philosophy_ articles from 1971 to 1974. Hopefully I'll do more such back-filling in the future.^[If anyone wants to help, the top of my agenda is filling in citations to _Analysis_ articles pre-1975. That I think is the most important miss right now.]

All that said, the answer to the italicised question is in @tbl-toppers.

For the years I am familiar with, that seems like a pretty good guide to what recent work was being most talked about. So I hope it's a good guide to the years I'm less familiar with.

In [A History of Philosophy Journals](https://websites.umich.edu/~weath/lda/topic85.html) I'd said that the word counting data suggested that "Meaning and Reference" [@10.2307_2025079] took a while to become influential. The citation data _does not_ back up that suggestion.

The centrality of philosophy of mind, and in particular of a fairly a priori approaches to philosophy of mind, to late twentieth-century philosophy is very interesting. I think people who are only familiar with contemporary work might be surprised at how widely discussed some of those papers were.

If you're interested in seeing more of this data, I'll end with the top 10s for each of the years. Some of these lists have more than 10 entries, because there are so many ties in the data.^[These are somewhat automatically generated. If you see any spellings or names that need correcting, please let me know. I don't know why the line spacing isn't the same as in the earlier table; also if you have ideas on that I'd love to hear them.]
