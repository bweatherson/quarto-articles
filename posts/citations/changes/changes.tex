By looking at changes in citation patterns, we can tell something about
the way in which academic philosophy has changed over the last few
decades. One thing that stands out is the reduction in armchair
approaches to non-fundamental questions. Another is that topics no
longer disappear from philosophy. Since around 2002, every topic that
has reached a certain level of prominence in the literature has retained
its prominence. This is notably not the case before the late 1990s.

By looking at changes in citation patterns, we can tell something about
the way in which academic philosophy has changed over the last few
decades. One thing that stands out is the reduction in armchair
approaches to non-fundamental questions. Another is that topics no
longer disappear from philosophy. Since around 2002, every topic that
has reached a certain level of prominence in the literature has retained
its prominence. This is notably not the case before the late 1990s.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

This paper is about citations of philosophy journal articles in
philosophy journal articles. The data comes from Web of Science. I'm
focussing on citations between philosophy journals for two reasons. One
is that the data is much cleaner. Citations to books, chapters, theses,
and other sources, requires a lot of work to be even approximately
correct, while citations of journals in journals are reasonably
reliable. (This is especially true for journals that use end of article
bibliographies; there the reliability is very high.) The second is that
the data is complete. It's very hard to get a complete list of all the
philosophy books published in a year, or even conceptually to think
about what that would mean. It's much easier to find some journals, and
get a complete list of their articles.

I'm focusing on journals published since 1965. So the citations are of
articles published since 1965, in articles published since 1965. That
means that at the start there are very few citations, since most
citations are to things a few years earlier.

One problem with using Web of Science is that it is very slow to update.
I'm using the XML files that are provided to subscribing institutions.
The most recent such files that are provided only go through mid-2022.
Much of the focus here is on citations since 2020. Crucially, this does
not mean 2020-2024; it just means 2020-to-mid-2022. This still turns out
to be a lot of citations.

Web of Science is also slow to add journals to its index. As
Table~\ref{tbl-list-of-journals} shows, several journals are only added
to the index well after 1965, or (in the case of some recently founded
journals) well after their founding. The biggest impact this has on this
paper is that we don't have the citation data for \emph{Analysis} before
1975, and that probably affects some of the results.

I'm also focusing on one hundred journals. I downloaded the citation
data for every journal in the categories Philosophy, and History and
Philosophy of Science, and picked out the hundred journals with the most
articles, which seemed to be primarily English language, analytic, and
philosophy as opposed to history of science journals. The journals that
I picked are listed in Table~\ref{tbl-list-of-journals}.

Of course the first year isn't the first year the journal started
publishing; it's when Web of Science started indexing them. And the last
year isn't when they ceased publishing; it's the most recent year
indexed. Web of Science is very slow at adding journals, and at adding
volumes. But it is, as far as I've found, pretty accurate within what it
adds.

One big exception to this is that it's never really understood how to
handle the `supplements' to \emph{Noûs}, i.e., \emph{Philosophical
Perspectives} and \emph{Philosophical Issues}. Some of these are
recorded as being their own thing, some of them are recorded as special
issues of \emph{Noûs}. In the latter case, the citations often only
start being tracked several years after publication, and the
bibliographic information is spotty. I've manually removed the ones that
were listed as being published in \emph{Noûs} but actually in one of the
supplements, because the data didn't seem sufficiently reliable. The
major cost of this is that Kit Fine's paper ``Essence and Modality''
isn't part of the study; this is something that I might need to correct.

I've also manually added citations to articles published in
\emph{Journal of Philosophy} between 1971 and 1974. I don't have good
data for what was cited in those articles. I don't know why Web of
Science indexes the Journal before and after that period, but it's an
important gap. Several of the most important articles of the journals
era are published in the Journal in those years, so I felt it was
important to include them. I hope that the manual adding I did led to
values on the same scale as what I got from everything else, but this is
a possible source of noise in the data.

Because Web of Science keeps adding journals, and journals keep getting
larger, the number of articles in this study keeps going up. The only
downward pressure comes from the fact that some journals haven't been
indexed for 2022 or even, in some cases, 2021.
Figure~\ref{fig-number-of-articles-by-year} shows how many articles each
year are in the study.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{changes_files/figure-pdf/fig-number-of-articles-by-year-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-number-of-articles-by-year}Number of articles in the
study each year}

\end{figure}%

On top of that, citation practices have changed and people now cite much
more widely than they used to. So the number of citations recorded each
year (to articles since 1965 indexed in these hundred journals), has
risen rather dramatically, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-number-of-citations-by-year}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{changes_files/figure-pdf/fig-number-of-citations-by-year-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-number-of-citations-by-year}Number of citations to
articles in the study each year}

\end{figure}%

On the other hand, since the overwhelming majority of citations are to
articles published earlier than the citing article, a larger number of
citations in total might be consistent with fewer citations per article
available to be cited. If we somewhat arbitrarily set the universe of
available to be cited papers as the set of papers with the same
publication date as the citing article or earlier,
Figure~\ref{fig-average-of-citations-by-year} shows how often the
average paper was cited each year (in these 100 journals).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{changes_files/figure-pdf/fig-average-of-citations-by-year-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-average-of-citations-by-year}Average number of
citations per available article in each year}

\end{figure}%

Between about 1978 and 2004, the different forces are roughly balanced.
There are more papers, and each paper cites more often, but there are
more papers available to be cited, and the mean stays at about 0.1. But
then the forces pushing this number up take over.

\section{Recent Citations}\label{sec-recent-citations}

The focus here is going to be on articles whose recent citation patterns
are markedly different to their citation pattern since 2020. To
understand these, it helps to have a sense of what the citations since
2020 are like.

The first thing to know about the 2020s is that the number of outbound
citations per article shot up, starting in 2021. This is shown in
\textbf{?@fig-outbound-citation-rate}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{changes_files/figure-pdf/fig-average-of-outbound-citations-by-year-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-average-of-outbound-citations-by-year}Average number
of outbound citations in each year}

\end{figure}%

Remember these are outbound citations to philosophy journal articles
published since 1965. At the left hand edge of
Figure~\ref{fig-average-of-outbound-citations-by-year}, the `since 1965'
constraint probably makes a big difference to the graph. It shouldn't
really make a difference towards the right of the graph, and yet the
line keeps going up.

Between the number of articles published since 2020, and the high rate
of outbound citations in those articles, there are a lot of citations
since 2020. The whole study, from 1965 to 2022, includes 379532
citations. The part since 2020 alone includes 121043 of those citations.

The study contains 99252 papers. So the average paper was cited about
1.2 times since 2020. Citations are not distributed at all evenly.
Table~\ref{tbl-count-of-recent-citations} shows how many articles have
at least \emph{n} citations since 2020 for various values of \emph{n}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rr@{}}

\end{longtable}

Just over 1\% of articles have at least fifteen citations since 2020.
Just under 0.1\% have at least fifty citations. I'll sometimes talk
below about articles that were once the center of attention having
`only' five citations since 2020. It's worth remembering that this still
means they are in the top 7\% or so for citations over that time. Most
things don't get cited, at least in other philosophy journals in this
time period.

The most recent article in that list is from 2016. That might lead you
to think that philosophy citations are typically to rather old articles.
This isn't true. Figure~\ref{fig-recent-cite-rate} shows how often, on
average, papers with different publication years are cited since 2020.

The peak is actually in 2018. Recently published articles are, on
average, cited more than articles from longer ago. It's just that the
citations are more widely spread out.
Table~\ref{tbl-recent-from-last-five} shows which articles since 2016
have the most citations since 2020.

The list of authors there is a little less white, and a little less
male, than most of the lists we'll see below. As we'll see, that's not
saying much.

Many of the articles that were recently widely cited have been cited a
lot almost as soon as they were published. But not all of them were.
Table~\ref{tbl-very-late-bloomers} lists the articles with the most
cites since 2020 that were, in a sense I'll get to below, not widely
cited when they were first published.

The variety of subjects there is interesting, and this will become
important later. Several of these papers can be now seen as foundational
papers in thriving topics within philosophy.

The last thing to note, and something that will be central to what I'm
discussing the rest of the paper, is that there is a `missing middle' in
Table~\ref{tbl-recent-high-cite}. The only articles on that list between
1976 and 1997 are by David Lewis. Table~\ref{tbl-last-quartile} shows
the ten most cited articles, since 2020, published from 1976 to 1997.

If we extended that list, the 15th, 16th, and 17th entries would also be
by David Lewis.

One thing I'm investigating here is how relatively little influence
journal articles from the 1980s and (much of) the 1990s have on the
recent literature, compared to the decades either side of that. The
focus here will be on the change in citation rates, how things that were
the center of attention in the 1980s and 1990s are not so important now.
But in the background will be the broader topic of how much the recent
literature is shaped by the 1970s, 2000s, and 2010s, but not the decades
in between.
