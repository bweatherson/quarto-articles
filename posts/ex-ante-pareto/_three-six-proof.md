Assume all the lotteries below agree on what happens to everyone except the six people a,b,c,d,e and f.

Define two lotteries as follows

Only a
:    a gets 1, b through f get 0

Risky Equality
:    1/3 chance that all of a through f get 1; otherwise all of them get 0.

We aim to show that Risky Equality ≿~∀~ Only a

Start with three new lotteries, Three-Way Spread, Three-Way Equal and Half-Risk

Three-Way Spread
:    1/3 chance of each of the following options: a gets 1, everyone else 0; b gets 1, everyone else 0; c gets 1, everyone else 0

By Finite Anonymity, every outcome of Three-Way Spread is socially just as good as Only a. By Partitionwise Indifference, that means Three-Way Spread is socially just as good as Only a. Now compare it to this lottery

Three-Way Equal
:    1/3 chance that all of a, b, c get 1, everyone else gets 0; 2/3 chance that everyone gets 0.

By Ex Ante Pareto Indifference, Three-Way Equal is socially just as good as Three-Way Spread. So by transitivity of socially just as good, Three-Way Equal is socially just as good as Only a. Now we'll do Half-Risk. There are three states, S1, S2 and S3, each with probability 1/3.

Half-Risk
:    If S1, a-d get 1, e and f get 0. If S2, e only gets 1. If S3, f only gets 1.

No matter which of S1-S3 happens, the outcome in Half-Risk is better than the outcome in Three-Way Equal, by Strong Pareto. So by Partitionwise Dominance, Half-Risk is socially better than Three-Way Equal. By Ex Ante Pareto Indifference, Half-Risk is socially just as good as Risky Equality. So putting all this together, Risky Equality is socially better than Only a.

We can generalise this proof to show that a 1/3 chance of 6n people getting 1 is better than n people getting 1 for sure. Just replace a, b, ..., f with groups of n people each.
