Say a probability frame is an ordered pair \langleW, P\rangle such that W is a set (intuitively, of worlds), and P is a function from W to probability functions defined on w. Say that \pi is a probability function defined over w. Intuitively, \pi is Novice's credence function, and P maps members of W to the credence a special person called The Expert has at each world. The philosophical question in the background, and it will stay in the background for this note, is what relationship must hold between \pi and \langleW, P\rangle to say that Novice defers to The Expert.

Kevin @Dorst2020 made some suggestions about what this relationship must look like, but it turned out these weren't quite right. In @DorstEtAl2021, it is shown that if W is finite, then the following two claims are equivalent. (I'll state the claims formally, then explain my notation.)

Total Trust
:    E(X | {*w*: E(X, P(*w*)) \geq *t*}, \pi) \geq *t*

Value
:    If O is a set of options, *s* is a recommended strategy for O, and *o* is a member of O, then E(*s*, \pi) \geq E(*o*, \pi).

There is a bit there to unpack. E is the expectation function, so E(X, Pr) is the expectation of X according to Pr. We'll generalise this a little to say that E(X | p, Pr) is the expectation of X according to Pr(\dot | p). So here's what Total Trust says. Take any random variable X. (In this context, a random variable is just a function from W to $\mathbb{R}$.) Update \pi on the proposition that consists of all and only worlds where The Expert at that world has an expected value for X at least equal to *t*. After that update, Novice also expects X's value to be at least *t*.

A decision problem is just a set of random variables. Intuitively, the problem is that Novice has to choose which bet to take from the set O, with the return being the value of the chosen bet at the actual world. A strategy for Novice is to defer the decision to The Expert. Formally, a strategy *s* is a function from W to O; it picks a random variable, i.e., a bet, at each world. For a strategy to be *recommended*, it has to satisfy two constraints. First, if P(*i*) = P(*j*), then *s*(*i*) = *s*(*j*). A strategy can't be more discriminating than The Expert's credences. For the second constraint, associate each strategy *s* with a random variable S such that S(*w*) = *s*(*w*)(*w*). That is, the value of S at *w* is the return at *w* of the member of O that *s* selects at *w*. The constraint then says that for any *O*~1~ \in O, E(*s*(*w*), P(*w*)) \geq E(O~1~, P(*w*)). That is, at *w*, The Expert does not think there is a member of O that in expectation does better than *s*(*w*). Given all that, Value says that The Novice does not expect any member of O to do better than any recommended strategy.

One of the things @DorstEtAl2021 show is that if W and O are finite, then Total Trust and Value are equivalent. As they put it, \pi Totally Trusts a frame \langleW, P\rangle iff it Values that frame. What I'll show is that this equivalence breaks down when we drop the finiteness assumptions. Indeed, it breaks down even when W is countably infinite.

Start with a frame I'll call **Coin**. A fair coin will be flipped repeatedly until it lands Tails. Let F be a random variable such that F = *x* iff the coin is flipped *x* times. (If the coin never lands Tails, we'll stipulate that F = 1. Since this has probability 0, it doesn't make a difference to what follows, but this case will matter below.) Novice knows these facts about F, so \pi(F = *x*) = 2^-*x*^. If F = *x*, then The Expert knows F \geq *x*, and updates on that. That is, P(F = *x*) = \pi(•|F \geq x). For any positive integer *i*, let O~i~ be the random variable that takes value 0 at F = *j* when *j* \leq *i*, and value 2^*i*^ at F = *j* when *j* > *i*. Let O be the set of each O~*i*~. The strategy *s* such that *s*(F = *i*) = O~*i*~ is recommended, as can be easily checked. But E(*s*) = 0, while for any *o* \in O, E(*o*, \pi) = \half. So Value fails on **Coin**.

On the other hand, \pi does Totally Trust **Coin**. [Note to self, I need a proof here.]

<!--Old proof that isn't quite working: To see this, let X be a random variable, and let *t* be any value. Let {*i*, \dots, *j*-1} be a set satisfying the following constraints. First, either *i* = 1 or E(X | F \geq *i*-1, \pi) \geq *t*. Second, for any *n* in that set, E(X | F \geq *n*, \pi) < *t*. Third, E(X | F \geq *j*, \pi) \geq *t*. Since E(X | F \geq *i*, \pi) = \pi(F < j | F \geq i)E(X | *i* \leq F < j) + \pi(F \geq j | F \geq i)E(X | F \geq j), it follows that E(X | *i* \leq F < j) < *t*. The set of all values *x* such that E(X | F \geq *x*, \pi) < *t* consists of at most countably many such sets, plus possibly an open set {*i*, *i*+1, \dots} such that whenever *x* \geq *i*, E(X | F \geq *x*, \pi) < *t*. So E(X | {*x*: E(X, P(F = *x*)) < *t*}, \pi) is the weighted average of countably many values each of which is less than *t*, so it is less than *t*.-->

So \pi Totally Trusts **Coin**, but doesn't Value it. So the equivalence between Total Trust and Value fails here. But you might very reasonably object on two scores. First, the value function used to generate the counterexample was unbounded, and we know that unbounded value functions lead to all sorts of paradoxes. Second, I didn't just make W infinite, I made O infinite as well, so this isn't a minimal generalisation of the original claim. It turns out that if we put both these constraints on, then the equivalence fails in the other direction: It is possible to get a frame that \pi Values, but does not Totally Trust.

Call the following frame **Bentham**. Again, a coin will be flipped until it lands Tails. If it ever lands
