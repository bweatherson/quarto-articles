# My Question

This is related to our earlier chats, but I thought it was best to start in a new chat. I'm interested in the intersection between the following two lines of thought.

## First Thread - Free Choice Permission

One debate about sentences like "You may have tea or coffee" is about whether the apparent implication that you may have coffee is pragmatic or semantic. So some linguists think that this does not literally entail that you may have coffee, but there is some pragmatic mechanism that reliably generates the (true) belief that you may have coffee. Other linguists (and philosophers) think that when we get the semantics of 'may' and 'or' correct, we'll see that it's really an entailment.

One argument for the semantic view is that we get the same kind of phenomena with ability modals, where the purported pragmatic mechanisms don't seem plausible. So "He could beat anyone in the town at chess or tennis" seems to imply he could beat anyone at chess *and* he could beat anyone at tennis. But the standard pragmatic explanations of the first case don't hold here.

More generally, sorting out ability modals seems relevant to sorting out free choice.

## Second thread - Ability Modals

One discussion in the recent philosophy literature has been whether ability modals should be read as diamond-like, i.e., as possibilities, or box-like, i.e., as necessities. They certainly *look* like diamonds. And there are some clear cases. "Shohei Ohtani can hit home runs" is definitely true, but it doesn't mean that Ohtani will definitely hit a home run every time he tries.

On the other hand, the box-like reading works better in code-breaking cases. If I pick up a stranger's phone, typically I can't access it because I don't know the code. But this is weird, since if I type in random numbers, I might hit the right ones. And whatever the code is, I have the ability to type those numbers into the phone. The problem seems to be that I can't *reliably* or *knowably* or something open the phone.

## Question

Is there any work connecting these two threads? And is there important work from the last 10 years (i.e., since 2015) about either one that could be relevant to the other?

## Direct Connections Between the Two Threads

Yes, there is significant work connecting free choice permission and ability modals! This connection has become a major topic in recent philosophy of language and linguistics, particularly since 2015. Here are the key developments:

### 1. **Malte Willer (2020) - "Two puzzles about ability can"**

This paper explicitly aims to explain why ability modals, while essentially being existential modal operators, sometimes resist distribution over disjunction and also have a tendency to license free choice inferences. Willer combines dynamic and inquisitive semantics to handle both phenomena within a unified framework.

### 2. **Rick Nouwen (2018) - "Free choice and distribution over disjunction: The case of free choice ability"**

This squib explores to what extent free choice abilities depend on the distribution over disjunction property, noting that most analyses of free choice need distribution over disjunction as a theorem for modals, but ability modals have been argued to fail to meet distribution over disjunction. This is exactly the tension you identified!

### 3. **Melissa Fusco (2020) - "Agential Free Choice"**

Fusco extends her semantic account of deontic free choice to the agentive modal 'can', treating free choice as a nonspecific de re phenomenon that affects disjunction, and addressing Kenny's dartboard cases. This directly tackles both of your threads simultaneously.

## Key Recent Developments on Ability Modals (Post-2015)

### The Diamond vs. Box Debate

There's been intense recent debate about whether ability modals should be analyzed as existential (diamond-like) or universal/conditional (box-like):

**1. Mandelkern, Schultheis, & Boylan (2017) - "Agentive Modals"**

They propose an "act conditional analysis" where a sentence like 'John can swim across the river' says that there is some practically available action such that if John tries to do it, he swims across the river. This combines elements of both existential and conditional analyses.

**2. Matthew Mandelkern (2024) - "Chance, ability, and control"**

This recent paper addresses the controversy between two claims: that ability requires control, and that success entails ability. Mandelkern introduces evidence from judgments about the possibility and probability of ability ascriptions, arguing in favor of the conditional analysis and against the control requirement.

**3. Paolo Santorio (2025) - "Ability as dependence modality"**

Santorio develops a theory where ability modals include reference to a notion of dependence, divorcing ability modals from a notion of agency. At the truth-conditional level, "S is able to A" says there is a circumstantially accessible world where S As, but with a not-at-issue element requiring that whether S As depends on intrinsic features of S.

**4. Malte Willer (2025) - "Quantifiers for a Modal Future"**

Willer recently noted that ability can resists distribution over disjunction (the Kenny problem) and that ability judgments may come in degrees of confidence, which are unexpected if we think of ability can as a simple quantifier over possible worlds.

## Why These Threads Are Connected

The connection stems from a fundamental puzzle: **Your argument for the semantic view of free choice relies on ability modals showing the same distribution behavior, but ability modals themselves are problematic because they seem to resist distribution over disjunction (Kenny's dartboard cases)!**

This creates a fascinating tension that recent literature has tried to resolve in several ways:

1. **Unified semantic treatments** (Willer, Fusco) that explain both free choice and the special behavior of ability modals
2. **Conditional analyses** (Mandelkern et al.) that explain why ability seems to require control/reliability
3. **Dependence-based accounts** (Santorio) that capture the intuition about control without making ability universal

The debate connects to your code-breaking example: the problem isn't just about diamonds vs. boxes, but about what kind of reliability or control is required for ability ascriptions—and whether this same requirement explains free choice inferences or complicates them.

## Recommended Reading Order

For someone coming from philosophy and interested in both threads, I'd suggest:

1. Start with **Willer (2020)** - directly addresses your question
2. Then **Nouwen (2018)** - short and focused on the distribution problem
3. **Fusco (2020)** - comprehensive treatment of both phenomena
4. **Mandelkern (2024)** - most recent take on the diamond/box debate
5. **Santorio (2025)** - alternative approach to the control problem

All of these appeared after 2015 and directly engage with the intersection of your two threads!

# Claude on NPIs in this context

Let me search for work on negative polarity items (NPIs) in these contexts.Excellent question! Yes, there is substantial work on NPIs in the context of both permission statements and ability modals, and this is actually a crucial part of the literature connecting your two threads.

## The Connection Between NPIs and Free Choice

The relationship between negative polarity items (NPIs) and free choice items (FCIs) is central to understanding both free choice permission and ability modals. In English, "any" functions as both an NPI and an FCI depending on context, which makes it particularly important for these debates.

### Key Work on NPIs/FCIs in Permission and Modal Contexts

**1. Maria Aloni (2007) - "Free choice, modals, and imperatives"**

This seminal paper proposes an analysis of imperatives and possibility and necessity statements that explains their differences with respect to the licensing of free choice "any" and accounts for the related phenomena of free choice disjunction in imperatives, permissions, and statements. "Any" and "or" are analyzed as operators introducing sets of alternative propositions, with free choice licensing operators treated as quantifiers over these sets.

Aloni specifically addresses why:
- "You may talk to anyone" (permission modal) licenses FCI "any" with free choice reading
- "Vincent must be anywhere" (necessity modal) does not license FCI "any"
- Imperatives pattern with permission modals in licensing FCI "any"

**2. Anastasia Giannakidou's work on nonveridicality**

Giannakidou develops a framework where NPIs are licensed in nonveridical contexts (where truth is not entailed), which includes questions, modals, and conditionals. Modal environments are known to be non-monotone, and both NPIs and FCIs are licensed in modal contexts. There is a class of items known as free choice items which require typically modal and quantificational licensers.

This explains why:
- "John may talk to anybody" is grammatical (permission modal licenses NPI/FCI)
- "Press any key" (imperative) is grammatical

**3. The "any" puzzle for ability modals**

Modal verbs like "can" create nonveridical contexts that license "any," and ability modals specifically pattern with other modals in licensing NPIs/FCIs. However, the interaction is complex because ability modals have special properties.

## Why This Matters for Your Question

The NPI/FCI connection is directly relevant to your two threads because:

1. **The argument for semantic free choice** often relies on the behavior of "any" in permission statements. If "You may have tea or coffee" semantically entails both permissions, then we'd expect "You may have any drink" to pattern similarly.

2. **Ability modals show the same licensing patterns**: "He can beat anyone at chess" uses FCI "any," and this construction generates the conjunctive-like inference (he can beat person A AND he can beat person B AND...).

3. **But there's a puzzle**: If ability modals license free choice "any" the same way permission modals do, why do ability modals resist distribution over disjunction (Kenny's dartboard) while permission modals don't?

## The Dual Nature of "Any"

Many linguists take the distinction between NPI and FCI uses of "any" as substantial, though some argue it's crucial to maintain a unified analysis. The question is whether:
- NPI "any" (as in "I don't see anyone") and FCI "any" (as in "Pick any card") are fundamentally different items, or
- They share a common semantic core that explains both distributions

## Recent Developments

**Giannakidou's challenges to exhaustivity-based accounts:**

Giannakidou has challenged the hypothesis that exhaustivity is the single defining property of all NPI and FCI paradigms, finding it inadequate to explain the distribution and interpretation of NPIs in several languages and unable to derive the actual distribution of "any" in nonveridical contexts.

This is relevant because many implicature-based accounts of free choice (including those you mentioned as "pragmatic" approaches) rely on exhaustification mechanisms similar to those used for scalar implicatures.

## Connection to Your Code-Breaking Example

The NPI/FCI licensing patterns suggest that ability modals create a special kind of modal space. The fact that "You can enter any password" gets a free choice reading (you have genuine optionality) while your code-breaking case doesn't give you ability suggests that:

- The licensing of "any" tracks something about the modal space created by ability ascriptions
- This might be related to the control/reliability issues you identified
- The box-like vs. diamond-like debate might be reflected in which NPIs/FCIs are licensed and how

## Recommended Reading

For your specific interest in NPIs with permission and ability modals, I'd suggest:

1. **Aloni (2007)** - The canonical treatment of "any" in permission statements and imperatives
2. **Giannakidou's work** on nonveridicality (multiple papers cited in the searches)
3. **Dayal (1998)** - "Any as inherently modal" (influential early work)
4. Look for whether **Willer (2020)** or **Fusco (2020)** discuss NPI licensing in their treatments of ability modals and free choice

The intersection of NPI/FCI licensing with ability modals might actually provide empirical evidence for choosing between the diamond and box analyses you mentioned!
