  The Equal Weight View of disagreement says that if an agent sees that an epistemic peer disagrees with her about p, the agent should change her credence in p to half way between her initial credence, and the peer's credence. But it is hard to believe the Equal Weight View for a surprising reason; not everyone believes it. And that means that if one did believe it, one would be required to lower one's belief in it in light of this peer disagreement. Brian Weatherson explores the options for how a proponent of the Equal Weight View might respond to this difficulty, and how this challenge fits into broader arguments against the Equal Weight View.

This paper started life as a short note I wrote around New Year 2007
while in Minneapolis. It was originally intended as a blog post. That
might explain, if not altogether excuse, the flippant tone in places.
But it got a little long for a post, so I made it into the format of a
paper and posted it to my website. The paper has received a lot of
attention, so it seems like it will be helpful to see it in print. Since
a number of people have responded to the argument as stated, I've
decided to just reprint the article warts and all, and make a few
comments at the end about how I see its argument in the context of the
subsequent debate.

**Disagreeing about Disagreement (2007)**
:::

I argue with my friends a lot. That is, I offer them reasons to believe
all sorts of philosophical conclusions. Sadly, despite the quality of my
arguments, and despite their apparent intelligence, they don't always
agree. They keep insisting on principles in the face of my wittier and
wittier counterexamples, and they keep offering their own dull alleged
counterexamples to my clever principles. What is a philosopher to do in
these circumstances? (And I don't mean get better friends.)

One popular answer these days is that I should, to some extent, defer to
my friends. If I look at a batch of reasons and conclude $p$, and my
equally talented friend reaches an incompatible conclusion $q$, I should
revise my opinion so I'm now undecided between $p$ and $q$. I should, in
the preferred lingo, assign equal weight to my view as to theirs. This
is despite the fact that I've looked at their reasons for concluding $q$
and found them wanting. If I hadn't, I would have already concluded $q$.
The mere fact that a friend (from now on I'll leave off the qualifier
'equally talented and informed', since all my friends satisfy that)
reaches a contrary opinion should be reason to move me. Such a position
is defended by Richard Feldman
[-@Feldman2005-FELRTE; -@Feldman2006-FELEPA], David Christensen
[-@Christensen2007-CHREOD] and Adam Elga [-@Elga2007-ELGRAD].

This equal weight view, hereafter EW, is itself a philosophical
position. And while some of my friends believe it, some of my friends do
not. (Nor, I should add for your benefit, do I.) This raises an odd
little dilemma. If EW is correct, then the fact that my friends disagree
about it means that I shouldn't be particularly confident that it is
true, since EW says that I shouldn't be too confident about any position
on which my friends disagree. But, as I'll argue below, to consistently
implement EW, I have to be maximally confident that it is true. So to
accept EW, I have to inconsistently both be very confident that it is
true and not very confident that it is true. This seems like a problem,
and a reason to not accept EW. We can state this argument formally as
follows, using the notion of a peer and an expert. Some people are peers
if they are equally philosophically talented and informed as each other,
and one is more expert than another if they are more informed and
talented than the other.

1.  There are peers who disagree about EW, and there is no one who is an
    expert relative to them who endorses EW.

2.  If 1 is true, then according to EW, my credence in EW should be less
    than 1.

3.  If my credence in EW is less than 1, then the advice that EW offers
    in a wide range of cases is incoherent.

4.  So, the advice EW offers in a wide range of cases is incoherent.

The first three sections of this paper will be used to defend the first
three premises. The final section will look at the philosophical
consequences of the conclusion.

### Peers and EW

Thomas Kelly [-@Kelly2005-KELTES] has argued against EW and in favour of
the view that a peer with the irrational view should defer to a peer
with the rational view. Elga helpfully dubs this the 'right reasons'
view. Ralph Wedgwood [-@Wedgwood2007-WEDNON Ch. 11] has argued against
EW and in favour of the view that one should have a modest 'egocentric
bias', i.e. a bias towards one's own beliefs. On the other hand, as
mentioned above, Elga, Christensen and Feldman endorse versions of EW.
So it certainly looks like there are very talented and informed
philosophers on either side of this debate.

Now I suppose that if we were taking EW completely seriously, we would
at this stage of the investigation look very closely at whether these
five really are epistemic peers. We could pull out their grad school
transcripts, look at the citation rates for their papers, get reference
letters from expert colleagues, maybe bring one or two of them in for
job-style interviews, and so on. But this all seems somewhat
inappropriate for a scholarly journal. Not to mention a little
tactless.[^1] So I'll just stipulate that they seem to be peers in the
sense relevant for EW, and address one worry a reader may have about my
argument.

An objector might say, "Sure it seems antecedently that Kelly and
Wedgwood are the peers of the folks who endorse EW. But take a look at
the arguments for EW that have been offered. They look like good
arguments, don't they? Doesn't the fact that Kelly and Wedgwood don't
accept these arguments mean that, however talented they might be in
general, they obviously have a blind spot when it comes to the
epistemology of disagreement? If so, we shouldn't treat them as experts
on this question." There is something right about this. People can be
experts in one area, or even many areas, while their opinions are
systematically wrong in another. But the objector's line is unavailable
to defenders of EW.

Indeed, these defenders have been quick to distance themselves from the
objector. Here, for instance, is Elga's formulation of the EW view, a
formulation we'll return to below.

> Your probability in a given disputed claim should equal your prior
> conditional probability in that claim. Prior to what? Prior to your
> thinking through the claim, and finding out what your advisor thinks
> of it. Conditional on what? On whatever you have learned about the
> circumstances of how you and your advisor have evaluated the claim.
> [@Elga2007-ELGRAD 490]

The fact that Kelly and Wedgwood come to different conclusions can't be
enough reason to declare that they are not peers. As Elga stresses, what
matters is the prior judgment of their acuity. And Elga is right to
stress this. If we declared anyone who doesn't accept reasoning that we
find compelling not a peer, then the EW view will be trivial. After all,
the EW view only gets its force from cases as described in the
introduction, where our friends reject reasoning we accept, and accept
reasons we reject. If that makes them not a peer, the EW view never
applies. So we can't argue that anyone who rejects EW is thereby less of
an expert in the relevant sense than someone who accepts it, merely in
virtue of their rejection of EW. So it seems we should accept premise 1.

### Circumstances of Evaluation

Elga worries about the following kind of case. Let $p$ be that the sum
of a certain series of numbers, all of them integers, is 50. Let $q$ be
that the sum of those numbers is $400e$. My friend and I both add the
numbers, and I conclude $p$ while he concludes $q$. It seems that there
is no reason to defer to my friend. I know, after all, that he has made
some kind of mistake. The response, say defenders of EW, is that
deference is context-sensitive. If I know, for example, that my friend
is drunk, then I shouldn't defer to him. More generally, as Elga puts
it, how much I should defer should depend on what I know about the
circumstances.

Now this is relevant because one of the relevant circumstances might be
that my friend has come to a view that I regard as insane. That's what
happens in the case of the sums. Since my prior probability that my
friend is right given that he has an insane seeming view is very low, my
posterior probability that my friend is right should also, according to
Elga, be low. Could we say that, although antecedently we regard
Wedgwood and Kelly as peers of those they disagree with, that the
circumstance of their disagreement is such that we should disregard
their views?

It is hard to see how this would be defensible. It is true that a
proponent of EW will regard Kelly and Wedgwood as wrong. But we can't
say that we should disregard the views of all those we regard as
mistaken. That leads to trivialising EW, for reasons given above. The
claim has to be that their views are so outrageous, that we wouldn't
defer to anyone with views that outrageous. And this seems highly
implausible. But that's the only reason that premise 2 could be false.
So we should accept premise 2.

### A Story about Disagreement

The tricky part of the argument is proving premise 3. To do this, I'll
use a story involving four friends, Apollo, Telemachus, Adam and Tom.
The day before our story takes place, Adam has convinced Apollo that he
should believe EW, and organise his life around it. Now Apollo and
Telemachus are on their way to Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox play the
Indians. There have been rumours flying around all day about whether the
Red Sox injured star player, David Ortiz, will be healthy enough to
play. Apollo and Telemachus have heard all the competing reports, and
are comparing their credences that Ortiz will play. (Call the
proposition that he will play $p$.) Apollo's credence in $p$ is 0.7, and
Telemachus's is 0.3. In fact, 0.7 is the rational credence in p given
their shared evidence, and Apollo truly believes that it is.[^2] And, as
it turns out, the Red Sox have decided but not announced that Ortiz will
play, so $p$ is true.

Despite these facts, Apollo lowers his credence in $p$. In accord with
his newfound belief in EW, he changes his credence in $p$ to 0.5. Apollo
is sure, after all, that when it comes to baseball Telemachus is an
epistemic peer. At this point Tom arrives, and with a slight disregard
for the important baseball game at hand, starts trying to convince them
of the right reasons view on disagreement. Apollo is not convinced, but
Telemachus thinks it sounds right. As he puts it, the view merely says
that the rational person believes what the rational person believes. And
who could disagree with that?

Apollo is not convinced, and starts telling them the virtues of EW. But
a little way in, Tom cuts him off with a question. "How probable," he
asks Apollo, "does something have to be before you'll assert it?"

Apollo says that it has to be fairly probable, though just what the
threshold is depends on just what issues are at stake. But he agrees
that it has to be fairly high, well above 0.5 at least.

"Well," says Tom, "in that case you shouldn't be defending EW in public.
Because you think that Telemachus and I are the epistemic peers of you
and Adam. And we think EW is false. So even by EW's own lights, the
probability you assign to EW should be 0.5. And that's not a high enough
probability to assert it." Tom's speech requires that Apollo regard he
and Telemachus as Apollo's epistemic peers with regard to this question.
By premises 1 and 2, Apollo should do this, and we'll assume that he
does.

So Apollo agrees with all this, and agrees that he shouldn't assert EW
any more. But he still plans to use it, i.e. to have a credence in $p$
of 0.5 rather than 0.7. But now Telemachus and Tom press on him the
following analogy.

Imagine that there were two competing experts, each of whom gave
differing views about the probability of $q$. One of the experts, call
her Emma, said that the probability of $q$, given the evidence, is 0.5.
The other expert, call her Rae, said that the probability of $q$, given
the evidence, is 0.7. Assuming that Apollo has the same evidence as the
experts, but he regards the experts as experts at evaluating evidence,
what should his credence in $q$ be? It seems plausible that it should be
a weighted average of what Emma says and what Rae says. In particular,
it should be 0.5 only if Apollo is maximally confident that Emma is the
expert to trust, and not at all confident that Rae is the expert to
trust.

The situation is parallel to the one Apollo actually faces. EW says that
his credence in $p$ should be 0.5. The right reason view says that his
credence in $p$ should be 0.7. Apollo is aware of both of these facts.
So his credence in $p$ should be 0.5 iff he is certain that EW is the
theory to trust, just as his credence in $q$ should be 0.5 iff he is
certain that Emma is the expert to trust. Indeed, a credence of 0.5 in
$p$ is incoherent unless Apollo is certain EW is the theory to trust.
But Apollo is not at all certain of this. His credence in EW, as is
required by EW itself, is 0.5. So as long as Apollo keeps his credence
in p at 0.5, he is being incoherent. But EW says to keep his credence in
p at 0.5. So EW advises him to be incoherent. That is, EW offers
incoherent advice. We can state this more carefully in an argument.

5.  EW says that Apollo's credence in p should be 0.5.

6.  If 5, then EW offers incoherent advice unless it also says that
    Apollo's credence in EW should be 1.

7.  EW says that Apollo's credence in EW should be 0.5.

8.  So, EW offers incoherent advice.

Since Apollo's case is easily generalisable, we can infer that in a
large number of cases, EW offers advice that is incoherent. Line 7 in
this argument is hard to assail given premises 1 and 2 of the master
argument. But I can imagine objections to each of the other lines.

*Objection*: Line 6 is false. Apollo can coherently have one credence in
p while being unsure about whether it is the rational credence to have.
In particular, he can coherently have his credence in p be 0.5, while he
is unsure whether his credence in p should be 0.5 or 0.7. In general
there is no requirement for agents who are not omniscient to have their
credences match their judgments of what their credences should be.

*Replies*: I have two replies to this, the first dialectical and the
second substantive.

The dialectical reply is that if the objector's position on coherence is
accepted, then a lot of the motivation for EW fades away. A core idea
behind EW is that Apollo was unsure before the conversation started
whether he or Telemachus would have the most rational reaction to the
evidence, and hearing what each of them say does not provide him with
more evidence. (See the 'bootstrapping' argument in @Elga2007-ELGRAD for
a more formal statement of this idea.) So Apollo should have equal
credence in the rationality of his judgment and of Telemachus's
judgment.

But if the objector is correct, Apollo can do that without changing his
view on EW one bit. He can, indeed should, have his credence in $p$ be
0.7, while being uncertain whether his credence in p should be 0.7 (as
he thinks) or 0.3 (as Telemachus thinks). Without some principle
connecting what Apollo should think about what he should think to what
Apollo should think, it is hard to see why this is not the uniquely
rational reaction to Apollo's circumstances. In other words, if this is
an objection to my argument against EW, it is just as good an objection
to a core argument for EW.

The substantive argument is that the objector's position requires
violating some very weak principles concerning rationality and
higher-order beliefs. The objector is right that, for instance, in order
to justifiably believe that $p$ (to degree $d$), one need not know, or
even believe, that one is justified in believing $p$ (to that degree).
If nothing else, the anti-luminosity arguments in @Williamson2000-WILKAI
show that to be the case. But there are weaker principles that are more
plausible, and which the objector's position has us violate. In
particular, there is the view that we can't both be justified in
believing that $p$ (to degree $d$), while we know we are not justified
in believing that we are justified in believing $p$ (to that degree). In
symbols, if we let $Jp$ mean that the agent is justified in believing
$p$, and box and diamond to be epistemic modals, we have the principle
**MJ** (for Might be Justified).

MJ

:   $Jp \rightarrow \diamond JJp$

This seems like a much more plausible principle, since if we know we
aren't justified in believing we're justified in believing $p$, it seems
like we should at least suspend judgment in $p$. That is, we shouldn't
believe $p$. That is, we aren't justified in believing $p$. But the
objector's position violates principle **MJ**, or at least a
probabilistic version of it, as we'll now show.

We aim to prove that the objector is committed to Apollo being justified
in believing $p$ to degree 0.5, while he knows he is not justified in
believing he is justified in believing $p$ to degree 0.5. The first part
is trivial, it's just a restatement of the objector's view, so it is the
second part that we must be concerned with.

Now, either EW is true, or it isn't true. If it is true, then Apollo is
not justified in having a greater credence in it than 0.5. But his only
justification for believing p to degree 0.5 is EW. He's only justified
in believing he's justified in believing $p$ if he can justify his use
of EW in it. But you can't justify a premise in which your rational
credence is 0.5. So Apollo isn't justified in believing he is justified
in believing $p$. If EW isn't true, then Apollo isn't even justified in
believing $p$ to degree 0.5. And he knows this, since he knows EW is his
only justification for lowering his credence in $p$ that far. So he
certainly isn't justified in believing he is justified in believing $p$
to degree 0.5 Moreover, every premise in this argument has been a
premise that Apollo knows to obtain, and he is capable of following all
the reasoning. So he knows that he isn't justified in believing he is
justified in believing $p$ to degree 0.5, as required.

The two replies I've offered to the objector complement one another. If
someone accepts **MJ**, then they'll regard the objector's position as
incoherent, since we've just shown that **MJ** is inconsistent with that
position. If, on the other hand, someone rejects **MJ** and everything
like it, then they have little reason to accept EW in the first place.
They should just accept that Apollo's credence in p should be, as per
hypothesis the evidence suggests, 0.7. The fact that an epistemic peer
disagrees, in the face of the same evidence, might give Apollo reason to
doubt that this is in fact that uniquely rational response to the
evidence. But, unless we accept a principle like **MJ**, that's
consistent with Apollo retaining the rational response to the evidence,
namely a credence of 0.7 in p. So it is hard to see how someone could
accept the objector's argument, while also being motivated to accept EW.
In any case, I think **MJ** is plausible enough on its own to undermine
the objector's position.[^3]

*Objection*: Line 5 is false. Once we've seen that the credence of EW is
0.5, then Apollo's credence in first-order claims such as p should, as
the analogy with q suggests, be a weighted average of what EW says it
should be, and what the right reason view says it should be. So, even by
EW's own lights, Apollo's credence in p should be 0.6.

*Replies*: Again I have a dialectical reply, and a substantive reply.

The dialectical reply is that once we make this move, we really have
very little motivation to accept EW. There is, I'll grant, some
intuitive plausibility to the view that when faced with a disagreeing
peer, we should think the right response is half way between our
competing views. But there is no intuitive plausibility whatsoever to
the view that in such a situation, we should naturally move to a
position three-quarters of the way between the two competing views, as
this objector suggests. Much of the argument for EW, especially in
Christensen, turns on intuitions about cases, and the objector would
have us give all of that up. Without those intuitions, however, EW falls
in a heap.

The substantive reply is that the idea behind the objection can't be
coherently sustained. The idea is that we should first apply EW to
philosophical questions to work out the probability of different
theories of disagreement, and then apply those probabilities to
first-order disagreements. The hope is that in doing so we'll reach a
stable point at which EW can be coherently applied. But there is no such
stable point. Consider the following series of questions.

Q1

:   Is EW true?

Two participants say yes, two say no. We have a dispute, leading to our
next question.

Q2

:   What is the right reaction to the disagreement over Q1?

EW answers this by saying our credence in EW should be 0.5. But that's
not what the right reason proponents say. They don't believe EW, so they
have no reason to move their credence in EW away from 0. So we have
another dispute, and we can ask

Q3

:   What is the right reaction to the disagreement over Q2?

EW presumably says that we should again split the difference. Our
credence in EW might now be 0.25, half-way between the 0.5 it was after
considering Q2, and what the right reasons folks say. But, again, those
who don't buy EW will disagree, and won't be moved to adjust their
credence in EW. So again there's a dispute, and again we can ask

Q4

:   What is the right reaction to the disagreement over Q3?

This could go on for a while. The only 'stable point' in the sequence is
when we assign a credence of 0 to EW. That's to say, the only way to
coherently defend the idea behind the objection is to assign credence 0
to EW. But that's to give up on EW. As with the previous objection, we
can't hold on to EW and object to the argument.

### Summing Up

The story I've told here is a little idealised, but otherwise common
enough. We often have disagreements both about first-order questions,
and about how to resolve this disagreement. In these cases, there is no
coherent way to assign equal weight to all prima facie rational views
both about the first order question and the second order,
epistemological, question. The only way to coherently apply EW to all
first order questions is to put our foot down, and say that despite the
apparent intelligence of our philosophical interlocutors, we're not
letting them dim our credence in EW. But if we are prepared to put our
foot down here, why not about some first-order question or other? It
certainly isn't because we have more reason to believe an
epistemological theory like EW than we have to believe first order
theories about which there is substantive disagreement. So perhaps we
should hold on to those theories, and let go of EW.

**Afterthoughts (2010)**
:::

I now think that the kind of argument I presented in the 2007 paper is
not really an argument against EW as such, but an argument against one
possible motivation for EW. I also think that alternate motivations for
EW are no good, so I still think it is an important argument. But I
think it's role in the dialectic is a little more complicated than I
appreciated back then.

Much of my thinking about disagreement problems revolves around the
following table. The idea behind the table, and much of the related
argument, is due to Thomas Kelly [-@Kelly2010-KELPDA]. In the table, $S$
and $T$ antecedently had good reasons to take themselves to be epistemic
peers, and they know that their judgments about $p$ are both based on
$E$. In fact, $E$ is excellent evidence for $p$, but only $S$ judges
that $p$; $T$ judges that $\neg p$. Now let's look at what seems to be
the available evidence for and against $p$.

::: {.center}
  ------------------------- ------------------------------
    **Evidence for $p$**       **Evidence against $p$**
   $S$'s judgment that $p$   $T$'s judgment that $\neg p$
             $E$            
  ------------------------- ------------------------------
:::

Now that doesn't look to me like a table where the evidence is equally
balanced for and against $p$. Even granting that the judgments are
evidence over and above $E$, and granting that how much weight we should
give to judgments should track our *ex ante* judgments of their
reliability rather than our *ex post* judgments of their reliability,
both of which strike me as false but necessary premises for EW, it
*still* looks like there is more evidence for $p$ than against $p$.[^4]
There is strictly more evidence for $p$ than against it, since $E$
exists. If we want to conclude that $S$ should regard $p$ and $\neg p$
as equally well supported for someone in her circumstance, we have to
show that the table is somehow wrong. I know of three possible moves the
EW defender could make here.

David Christensen [-@Christensen2010-CHRDQB], as I read him, says that
the table is wrong because when we are representing the evidence $S$
has, we should not include her own judgment. There's something plausible
to this. Pretend for a second that $T$ doesn't exist, so it's clearly
rational for $S$ to judge that $p$. It would still be wrong of $S$ to
say, "Since $E$ is true, $p$. And I judged that $p$, so that's another
reason to believe that $p$, because I'm smart." By hypothesis, $S$ is
smart, and that smart people judge things is reason to believe those
things are true. But this doesn't work when the judgment is one's own.
This is something that needs explaining in a full theory of the
epistemic significance of judgment, but let's just take it as a given
for now.[^5] Now the table, or at least the table as is relevant to $S$,
looks as follows.

::: {.center}
  ---------------------- ------------------------------
   **Evidence for $p$**     **Evidence against $p$**
           $E$            $T$'s judgment that $\neg p$
  ---------------------- ------------------------------
:::

But I don't think this does enough to support EW, or really anything
like it. First, it won't be true in general that the two sides of this
table balance. In many cases, $E$ is strong evidence for $p$, and $T$'s
judgment won't be particularly strong evidence against $p$. In fact, I'd
say the kind of case where $E$ is much better evidence for $p$ than
$T$'s judgment is against $p$ is the statistically normal kind. Or, at
least, it is the normal kind of case modulo the assumption that $S$ and
$T$ have the same evidence. In cases where that isn't true, learning
that $T$ thinks $\neg p$ is good evidence that $T$ has evidence against
$p$ that you don't have, and you should adjust accordingly. But by
hypothesis, $S$ knows that isn't the case here. So I don't see why this
should push us even close to taking $p$ and $\neg p$ to be equally well
supported.

The other difficulty for defending EW by this approach is that it seems
to undermine the original motivations for the view. As Christensen
notes, the table above is specifically for $S$. Here's what the table
looks like for $T$.

::: {.center}
  ------------------------- --------------------------
    **Evidence for $p$**     **Evidence against $p$**
   $S$'s judgment that $p$  
             $E$            
  ------------------------- --------------------------
:::

It's no contest! So $T$ should firmly believe $p$. But that isn't the
intuition anyone gets, as far as I can tell, in any of the cases
motivating EW. And the big motivation for EW comes from intuitions about
cases. Once we acknowledge that these intuitions are unreliable, as we'd
have to do if we were defending EW this way, we seem to lack any reason
to accept EW.

The second approach to blocking the table is to say that $T$'s judgment
is an undercutting defeater for the support $E$ provides for $p$. This
looks superficially promising. Having a smart person say that your
evidence supports something other than you thought it did seems like it
could be an undercutting defeater, since it is a reason to think the
evidence supports something else, and hence doesn't support what you
thought it does. And, of course, if $E$ is undercut, then the table just
has one line on it, and the two sides look equal.

But it doesn't seem like it can work in general, for a reason that
@Kelly2010-KELPDA makes clear. We haven't said what $E$ is so far. Let's
start with a case where $E$ consists of the judgments of a million other
very smart people that $p$. Then no one, not even the EW theorist, will
think that $T$'s judgment undercuts the support $E$ provides to $p$.
Indeed, even if $E$ just consists of one other person's judgment, it
won't be undercut by $T$'s judgment. The natural thought for an
EW-friendly person to have in that case is that since there are two
people who think $p$, and one who thinks $\neg p$, then $S$'s credence
in $p$ should be $\frac{2}{3}$. But that's impossible if $E$, i.e.,
the third person's judgment, is undercut by $T$'s judgment. It's true
that $T$'s judgment will partially *rebut* the judgments that $S$, and
the third party, make. It will move the probability of $p$, at least
according to EW, from 1 to $\frac{2}{3}$. But that evidence won't be
in any way *undercut*.

And as Kelly points out, evidence is pretty fungible. Whatever support
$p$ gets from other people's judgments, it could get very similar
support from something other than a judgment. We get roughly the same
evidence for $p$ by learning that a smart person predicts $p$ as
learning that a successful computer model predicts $p$. So the following
argument looks sound to me.

1.  When $E$ consists of other people's judgments, the support it
    provides to $p$ is not undercut by $T$'s judgment.

2.  If the evidence provided by other people's judgments is not undercut
    by $T$'s judgment, then some non-judgmental evidence is not undercut
    by $T$'s judgment.

3.  So, not all non-judgmental evidence is not undercut by $T$'s
    judgment.

So it isn't true in general that the table is wrong because $E$ has been
defeated by an undercutting defeater.

There's another problem with the defeat model in cases where the initial
judgments are not full beliefs. Change the case so $E$ provides
basically no support to either $p$ or $\neg p$. In fact, $E$ is just
irrelevant to $p$, and the agent's have nothing to base either a firm or
a probabilistic judgment about $p$ on. For this reason, $S$ declines to
form a judgment, but $T$ forms a firm judgment that $p$. Moreover,
although both $S$ and $T$ are peers, that's because they are both
equally poor at making judgments about cases like $p$. Here's the table
then:

::: {.center}
  ------------------------- --------------------------
    **Evidence for $p$**     **Evidence against $p$**
   $T$'s judgment that $p$  
  ------------------------- --------------------------
:::

Since $E$ is irrelevant, it doesn't appear, either before or after we
think about defeaters. And since $T$ is not very competent, that's not
great evidence for $p$. But EW says that $S$ should 'split the
difference' between her initial agnositicism, and $T$'s firm belief in
$p$. I don't see how that could be justified by $S$'s evidence.

So that move doesn't work either, and we're left with the third option
for upsetting the table. This move is, I think, the most promising of
the lot. It is to say that $S$'s own judgment *screens off* the evidence
that $E$ provides. So the table is misleading, because it 'double
counts' evidence.

The idea of screening I'm using here, at least on behalf of EW, comes
from Reichenbach's *The Direction of Time*, and in particular from his
work on deriving a principle that lets us infer events have a common
cause. The notion was originally introduced in probabilistic terms. We
say that $C$ screens off the positive correlation between $B$ and $A$ if
the following two conditions are met.

1.  $A$ and $B$ are positively correlated probabilistically, i.e.
    $Pr(A | B) > Pr(A)$.

2.  Given $C$, $A$ and $B$ are probabilistically independent,\
    i.e. $Pr(A | B \wedge C) = Pr(A | C)$.

I'm interested in an evidential version of screening. If we have a
probabilistic analysis of evidential support, the version of screening
I'm going to offer here is identical to the Reichenbachian version just
provided. But I want to stay neutral on whether we should think of
evidence probabilistically.[^6] When I say that $C$ screens off the
evidential support that $B$ provides to $A$, I mean the following. (Both
these clauses, as well as the statement that $C$ screens off $B$ from
$A$, are made relative to an evidential background. I'll leave that as
tacit in what follows.)

1.  $B$ is evidence that $A$.

2.  $B \wedge C$ is no better evidence that $A$ than $C$ is.[^7]

Here is one stylised example of where screening helps conceptualise
things. Detective Det is trying to figure out whether suspect Sus
committed a certain crime. Let $A$ be that Sus is guilty, $B$ be that
Sus's was seen near the crime scene near the time the crime was
committed, and $C$ be that Sus was at the crime scene when the crime was
committed. Then both clauses are satisfied. $B$ is evidence for $A$;
that's why we look for witnesses who place the suspect near the crime
scene. But given the further evidence $C$, then $B$ is neither here nor
there with respect to $A$. We're only interested in finding if Sus was
near the crime scene because we want to know whether he was at the crime
scene. If we know that he was there, then learning he was seen near
there doesn't move the investigation along. So both clauses of the
definition of screening are satisfied.

When there is screened evidence, there is the potential for double
counting. It would be wrong to say that if we know $B \wedge C$ we have
two pieces of evidence against Sus. Similarly, if a judgment screens off
the evidence it is based on, then the table 'double counts' the evidence
for $p$. Removing the double counting, by removing $E$, makes the table
symmetrical. And that's just what EW needs.

So the hypothesis that judgments screen the evidence they are based on,
or JSE for short, can help EW respond to the argument from this table.
But JSE is vulnerable to regress arguments. I now think that the
argument in 'Disagreeing about Disagreement' is a version of the regress
argument against JSE. So really it's an argument against the most
promising response to a particularly threatening argument against EW.

Unfortunately for EW, those regress arguments are actually quite good.
To see ths, let's say an agent makes a judgment on the basis of $E$, and
let $J$ be the proposition that that judgment was made. JSE says that
$E$ is now screened off, and the agent's evidence is just $J$. But with
that evidence, the agent presumably makes a new judgment. Let $J^\prime$
be the proposition that that judgment was made. We might ask now, does
$J^\prime$ sit alongside $J$ as extra evidence, is it screened off by
$J$, or does it screen off $J$? The picture behind JSE, the picture that
says that judgments on the basis of some evidence screen that evidence,
suggest that $J^\prime$ should in turn screen $J$. But now it seems we
have a regress on our hands. By the same token, $J^{\prime \prime}$, the
proposition concerning the new judgment made on the basis of $J^\prime$,
should screen off $J^\prime$, and the proposition
$J^{\prime \prime \prime}$ about the fourth judgment made, should screen
off $J^{\prime \prime}$, and so on. The poor agent has no unscreened
evidence left! Something has gone horribly wrong.

I think this regress is ultimately fatal for JSE. But to see this, we
need to work through the possible responses that a defender of JSE could
make. There are really just two moves that seem viable. One is to say
that the regress does not get going, because $J$ is better evidence than
$J^\prime$, and perhaps screens it. The other is to say that the regress
is not vicious, because all these judgments should agree in their
content. I'll end the paper by addressing these two responses.

The first way to avoid the regress is to say that there is something
special about the first level. So although $J$ screens $E$, it isn't the
case that $J^\prime$ screens $J$. That way, the regress doesn't start.
This kind of move is structurally like the move Adam Elga
[-@Elga2010-ELGHTD] has recently suggested. He argues that we should
adjust our views about first-order matters in (partial) deference to our
peers, but we shouldn't adjust our views about the right response to
disagreement in this way.

It's hard to see what could motivate such a position, either about
disagreement or about screening. It's true that we need some kind of
stopping point to avoid these regresses. But the most natural stopping
point is the very first level. Consider a toy example. It's common
knowledge that there are two apples and two oranges in the basket, and
no other fruit. (And that no apple is an orange.) Two people disagree
about how many pieces of fruit there are in the basket. $A$ thinks there
are four, $B$ thinks there are five, and both of them are equally
confident. Two other people, $C$ and $D$, disagree about what $A$ and
$B$ should do in the face of this disagreement. All four people regard
each other as peers. Let's say $C$'s position is the correct one
(whatever that is) and $D$'s position is incorrect. Elga's position is
that $A$ should partially defer to $B$, but $C$ should not defer to $D$.
This is, intuitively, just back to front. $A$ has evidence that
immediately and obviously entails the correctness of her position. $C$
is making a complicated judgment about a philosophical question where
there are plausible and intricate arguments on each side. The position
$C$ is in is much more like the kind of case where experience suggests a
measure of modesty and deference can lead us away from foolish errors.
If anyone should be sticking to their guns here, it is $A$, not $C$.

The same thing happens when it comes to screening. Let's say that $A$
has some evidence that (a) she has made some mistakes on simple sums in
the past, but (b) tends to massively over-estimate the likelihood that
she's made a mistake on any given puzzle. What should she do? One
option, in my view the correct one, is that she should believe that
there are four pieces of fruit in the basket, because that's what the
evidence obviously entails. Another option is that she should be not
very confident there are four pieces of fruit in the basket, because she
makes mistakes on these kinds of sums. Yet another option is that she
should be pretty confident (if not completely certain) that there are
four pieces of fruit in the basket, because if she were not very
confident about this, this would just be a manifestation of her
over-estimation of her tendency to err. The 'solution' to the regress
we're considering here says that the second of these three reactions is
the uniquely rational reaction. The idea behind the solution is that we
should respond to the evidence provided by first-order judgments, and
correct that judgment for our known biases, but that we shouldn't in
turn correct for the flaws in our self-correcting routine. I don't see
what could motivate such a position. Either we just rationally respond
to the evidence, and in this case just believe there are four pieces of
fruit in the basket, or we keep correcting for errors we make in any
judgment. It's true that the latter plan leads either to regress or to
the kind of ratificationism we're about to critically examine. But
that's not because the disjunction is false, it's because the first
disjunct is true.

A more promising way to avoid the regress is suggested by some other
work of Elga's, in this case a paper he co-wrote with Andy Egan
[@Egan2005-EGAICB]. Their idea, as I understand them, is that for any
rational agent, any judgment they make must be such that when they add
the fact that they made that judgment to their evidence (or, perhaps
better given JSE, replace their evidence with the fact that they made
that judgment), the rational judgment to make given the new evidence has
the same content as the original judgment. So if you're rational, and
you come to believe that $p$ is likely true, then the rational thing to
believe given you've made that judgment is that $p$ is likely true.

Note that this isn't as strong a requirement as it may first seem. The
requirement is not that any time an agent makes a judgment, rationality
requires that they say on reflection that it is the correct judgments.
Rather, the requirement is that the only judgments rational agents make
are those judgments that, on reflection, she would reflectively endorse.
We can think of this as a kind of ratifiability constraint on judgment,
like the ratifiability constraint on decision making that Richard
Jeffrey uses to handle Newcomb cases @JeffreyLogicOfDecision.

To be a little more precise, a judgment is ratifiable for agent $S$ just
in case the rational judgment for $S$ to make conditional on her having
made that judgment has the same content as the original judgment. The
thought then is that we avoid the regress by saying rational agents
always make ratifiable judgments. If the agent does do that, there isn't
much of a problem with the regress; once she gets to the first level,
she has a stable view, even once she reflects on it.

It seems to me that this assumption, that only ratifiable judgments are
rational, is what drives most of the arguments in Egan and Elga's paper
on self-confidence, so I don't think this is a straw-man move. Indeed,
as the comparison to Jeffrey suggests, it has some motivation behind it.
Nevertheless it is false. I'll first note one puzzling feature of the
view, then one clearly false implication of the view.

The puzzling feature is that in some cases there may be nothing we can
rationally do which is ratifiable. One way this can happen involves a
slight modification of Egan and Elga's example of the
directionaly-challenged driver. Imagine that when I'm trying to decide
whether $p$, for any $p$ in a certain field, I know (a) that whatever
judgment I make will usually be wrong, and (b) if I conclude my
deliberations without making a judgment, then $p$ is usually true. If we
also assume JSE, then it follows there is no way for me to end
deliberation. If I make a judgment, I will have to retract it because of
(a). But if I think of ending deliberation, then because of (b) I'll
have excellent evidence that $p$, and it would be irrational to ignore
this evidence. (Nicholas @Silins2005 has used the idea that failing to
make a judgment can be irrational in a number of places, and those
arguments motivated this example.)

This is puzzling, but not obviously false. It is plausible that there
are some epistemic dilemmas, where any position an agent takes is going
to be irrational. (By that, I mean it is at least as plausible that
there are epistemic dilemmas as that there are moral dilemmas, and I
think the plausibility of moral dilemmas is reasonably high.) That a
case like the one I've described in the previous paragraph is a dilemma
is perhaps odd, but no reason to reject the theory.

The real problem, I think, for the ratifiability proposal is that there
are cases where unratifiable judgments are clearly preferable to
ratifiable judgments. Assume that I'm a reasonably good judge of what's
likely to happen in baseball games, but I'm a little over-confident. And
I know I'm over-confident. So the rational credence, given some
evidence, is usually a little closer to $\frac{1}{2}$ than I admit.
At risk of being arbitrarily precise, let's say that if $p$ concerns a
baseball game, and my credence in $p$ is $x$, the rational credence in
$p$, call it $y$, for someone with no other information than this is
given by:

$$y = x + \frac{sin(2\pi x)}{50}$$

To give you a graphical sense of how that looks, the dark line in this
graph is $y$, and the lighter diagonal line is $y = x$.

::: {.center}

:::

Note that the two lines intersect at three points:
$(0, 0), (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ and $(1, 1)$. So if my
credence in $p$ is either 0, $\frac{1}{2}$ or 1, then my judgment is
ratifiable. Otherwise, it is not. So the ratifiability constraint says
that for any $p$ about a baseball game, my credence in $p$ should be
either 0, $\frac{1}{2}$ or 1. But that's crazy. It's easy to imagine
that I know (a) that in a particular game, the home team is much
stronger than the away team, (b) that the stronger team usually, but far
from always, wins baseball games, and (c) I'm systematically a little
over-confident about my judgments about baseball games, in the way just
described. In such a case, my credence that the home team will win
should be high, but less than 1. That's just what the ratificationist
denies is possible.

This kind of case proves that it isn't always rational to have
ratifiable credences. It would take us too far afield to discuss this in
detail, but it is interesting to think about the comparison between the
kind of case I just discussed, and the objections to backwards induction
reasoning in decision problems that have been made by Pettit and Sugden
[-@Pettit1989-PETTBI], and by Stalnaker
[-@Stalnaker1996; -@Stalnaker1998; -@Stalnaker1999]. The backwards
induction reasoning they criticise is, I think, a development of the
idea that decisions should be ratifiable. And the clearest examples of
when that reasoning fails concern cases where there is a unique
ratifiable decision, and it is guaranteed to be one of the worst
possible outcomes. The example I described in the last few paragraphs
has, quite intentionally, a similar structure.

The upshot of all this is that I think these regress arguments work.
They aren't, I think, directly an argument against EW. What they are is
an argument against the most promising way the EW theorist has for
arguing that the table I started with misstates $S$'s epistemic
situation. Given that the regress argument against JSE works though, I
don't see any way of rescuing EW from this argument.

[^1]: Though if EW is correct, shouldn't the scholarly journals be full
    of just this information?

[^2]: This is obviously somewhat of an idealisation, since there won't
    usually be a unique precise rational response to the evidence. But I
    don't think this idealisation hurts the argument to follow. I should
    note that the evidence here *excludes* their statements of their
    credences, so I really mean the evidence that they brought to bear
    on the debate over whether $p$.

[^3]: Added in 2010: I still think there's a dilemma here for EW, but
    I'm less convinced than I used to be that **MJ** is correct.

[^4]: By *ex ante* and *ex post* I mean before and after we learn about
    $S$ and $T$'s use of $E$ to make a judgment about $p$. I think that
    should change how reliable we take $S$ and $T$ to be, and that this
    should matter to what use, if any, we put their judgments, but it is
    crucial to EW that we ignore this evidence. Or, at least, it is
    crucial to EW that $S$ and $T$ ignore this evidence.

[^5]: My explanation is that evidence screens any judgments made on the
    basis of that evidence, in the sense of screening to be described
    below.

[^6]: In general I'm sceptical of always treating evidence
    probabilistically. Some of my reasons for scepticism are in
    @Weatherson2007.

[^7]: Branden Fitelson pointed out to me that the probabilistic version
    entails one extra condition, namely that $\neg B \wedge C$ is no
    worse evidence for $A$ than $C$ is. But I think that extra condition
    is irrelevant to disagreement debates, so I'm leaving it out.
