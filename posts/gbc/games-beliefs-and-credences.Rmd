I've defended an interest-relative theory of belief. This paper
continues the defence. I have four aims.

1.  To offer a new kind of reason for being unsatisfied with the simple
    Lockean reduction of belief to credence.

2.  To defend the legitimacy of appealing to credences in a theory of
    belief.

3.  To illustrate the importance of theoretical, as well as practical,
    interests in an interest-relative account of belief.

4.  To have another try at extending my basic account of belief to cover
    propositions that are practically and theoretically irrelevant to
    the agent.

You're probably familiar with the following dialectic. We want there to
be some systematic connection between credences and beliefs. At first
blush, saying that a person believes $p$ and has a very low credence in
$p$ isn't just an accusation of irrationality, it is literally
incoherent. The simplest such connection would be a reduction of beliefs
to credences. But the simplest reductions don't work.

</aside>

If we identify beliefs with credence 1, and take credences to support
betting dispositions, then a rational agent will have very few beliefs.
There are lots of things that an agent, we would normally say, believes
even though she wouldn't bet on them at absurd odds. Note that this
argument doesn't rely on *reducing* credences to betting dispositions;
as long as credences support the betting dispositions, the argument goes
through.

A simple retreat is to the so-called **Lockean thesis**, which holds
that to believe that $p$ is to have credence in $p$ greater than some
threshold $t$, where $t < 1$. Just how the threshold is determined could
be a matter of some discretion. Perhaps it is a function of the agent's
situation, or of the person ascribing beliefs to the agent, or to the
person evaluating that ascription. Never mind these complexities;
assuming all such things are held fixed, the Lockean thesis says that
there is a threshold $t$ such that everything with credence above $t$ is
believed.

There's a simple objection to the Lockean thesis. Given some very weak
assumptions about the world, it implies that there are plenty of
quadruples $\langle S, A, B, A \wedge B \rangle$ such that

-   $S$ is a rational agent.

-   $A, B$ and $A \wedge B$ are propositions.

-   $S$ believes $A$ and believes $B$.

-   $S$ does not believe $A \wedge B$.

-   $S$ knows that she has all these states, and consciously
    reflectively endorses them.

Now one might think, indeed I do think, that such quadruples do not
exist at all. But set that objection aside. If the Lockean is correct,
these quadruples should be everywhere. That's because for any
$t \in (0, 1)$ you care to pick, quadruples of the form
$\langle S, C, D, C \wedge D \rangle$ are very very common.

-   $S$ is a rational agent.

-   $C, D$ and $C \wedge D$ are propositions.

-   $S$'s credence in $C$ is greater than $t$, and her credence in $D$
    is greater than $t$.

-   $S$'s credence in $C \wedge D$ is less than $t$.

-   $S$ knows that she has all these states, and reflectively endorses
    them.

The best arguments for the existence of quadruples
$\langle S, A, B, A \wedge B \rangle$ are non-constructive existence
proofs. David @Christensen2005 for instance, argues from the existence
of the preface paradox to the existence of these quadruples. I've
expressed some reservations about that argument in the past
[@Weatherson2005-WEACWD]. But what I want to stress here is that even if
these existence proofs work, they don't really prove what the Lockean
needs. They don't show that quadruples satisfying the constraints we
associated with $\langle S, A, B, A \wedge B \rangle$ are just as common
as quadruples satisfying the constraints we associated with
$\langle S, C, D, C \wedge D \rangle$, for any $t$. But if the Lockean
were correct, they should be exactly as common.

This kind of consideration pushes some of us, well me in any case,
towards an interest-relative account of belief. But I'm going to set
that move aside to start by investigating a different objection. This
objection holds that the Lockean thesis could not be true, because
credence 1 is not *sufficient* for belief. That is, the Lockean is
committed to the thesis known as *regularity*; that everything left open
by belief gets a positive credence. I think regularity is false. That's
hardly news, there are plenty of good arguments against it, though most
of these involve cases with some idealisations. Timothy
@Williamson2007-WILHPI has a compelling argument against regularity
turning on reflections about a case involving infinite coin flips.[^1]
I'm going to offer a 'finite' argument against regularity, which I hope
is of independent interest, and from that conclude the Lockean is
mistaken. There is a worry that my argument against the Lockean also
undermines my preferred positive view, and I'll suggest an independently
motivated patch. I'll then turn to Richard Holton's attack on the very
notion of credence, which obviously would have repercussions for
attempts to understand beliefs in terms of credences were it to succeed.
I think it doesn't succeed, but it does show there are important and
underappreciated constraints on a theory of belief. I'll conclude with a
comparison between my preferred interest-relative account of belief, and
a recent account suggested by Jacob Ross and Mark Schroeder. The short
version of the comparison is that I think there's less difference
between the views than Ross and Schroeder think, though naturally I
think what differences there are favour my view.

### Playing Games with a Lockean

I'm going to raise problems for Lockeans, and for defenders of
regularity in general, by discussing a simple game. The game itself is a
nice illustration of how a number of distinct solution concepts in game
theory come apart. (Indeed, the use I'll make of it isn't a million
miles from the use that @KohlbergMertens1986 make of it.) To set the
problem up, I need to say a few words about how I think of game theory.
This won't be at all original - most of what I say is taken from
important works by Robert @Stalnaker1994
[@Stalnaker1996; @Stalnaker1998; @Stalnaker1999]. But it is different to
what I used to think, and perhaps to what some other people think too,
so I'll set it out slowly.[^2]

Start with a simple decision problem, where the agent has a choice
between two acts $A_1$ and $A_2$, and there are two possible states of
the world, $S_1$ and $S_2$, and the agent knows the payouts for each
act-state pair are given by the following able.

::: {.center}
  ------- ------- -------
           $S_1$   $S_2$
    $A_1$    4       0
    $A_2$    1       1
  ------- ------- -------
:::

What to do? I hope you share the intuition that it is radically
underdetermined by the information I've given you so far. If $S_2$ is
much more probable than $S_1$, then $A_2$ should be chosen; otherwise
$A_1$ should be chosen. But I haven't said anything about the relative
probability of those two states. Now compare that to a simple game. Row
has two choices, which I'll call $A_1$ and $A_2$. Column also has two
choices, which I'll call $S_1$ and $S_2$. It is common knowledge that
each player is rational, and that the payouts for the pairs of choices
are given in the following table. (As always, Row's payouts are given
first.)

::: {.center}
  ------- ------- -------
           $S_1$   $S_2$
    $A_1$  4, 0    0, 1
    $A_2$  1, 0    1, 1
  ------- ------- -------
:::

What should Row do? This one is easy. Column gets 1 for sure if she
plays $S_2$, and 0 for sure if she plays $S_1$. So she'll play $S_2$.
And given that she's playing $S_2$, it is best for Row to play $A_2$.

You probably noticed that the game is just a version of the decision
problem that we discussed a couple of paragraphs ago. The relevant
states of the world are choices of Column. But that's fine; we didn't
say in setting out the decision problem what constituted the states
$S_1$ and $S_2$. And note that we solved the problem without explicitly
saying anything about probabilities. What we added was some information
about Column's payouts, and the fact that Column is rational. From there
we deduced something about Column's play, namely that she would play
$S_2$. And from that we concluded what Row should do.

There's something quite general about this example. What's distinctive
about game theory isn't that it involves any special kinds of decision
making. Once we get the probabilities of each move by the other player,
what's left is (mostly) expected utility maximisation. (We'll come back
to whether the 'mostly' qualification is needed below.) The distinctive
thing about game theory is that the probabilities aren't specified in
the setup of the game; rather, they are solved for. Apart from special
cases, such as where one option strictly dominates another, we can't say
much about a decision problem with unspecified probabilities. But we can
and do say a lot about games where the setup of the game doesn't specify
the probabilities, because we can solve for them given the other
information we have.

This way of thinking about games makes the description of game theory as
'interactive epistemology' [@Aumann1999] rather apt. The theorist's work
is to solve for what a rational agent should think other rational agents
in the game should do. From this perspective, it isn't surprising that
game theory will make heavy use of equilibrium concepts. In solving a
game, we must deploy a theory of rationality, and attribute that theory
to rational actors in the game itself. In effect, we are treating
rationality as something of an unknown, but one that occurs in every
equation we have to work with. Not surprisingly, there are going to be
multiple solutions to the puzzles we face.

This way of thinking lends itself to an epistemological interpretation
of one of the most puzzling concepts in game theory, the mixed strategy.
Arguably the core solution concept in game theory is the Nash
equilibrium. As you probably know, a set of moves is a Nash equilibrium
if no player can improve their outcome by deviating from the
equilibrium, conditional on no other player deviating. In many simple
games, the only Nash equilibria involve mixed strategies. Here's one
simple example.

::: {.center}
  ------- ------- -------
           $S_1$   $S_2$
    $A_1$  0, 1    10, 0
    $A_2$  9, 0    -1, 1
  ------- ------- -------
:::

This game is reminiscent of some puzzles that have been much discussed
in the decision theory literature, namely asymmetric Death in Damascus
puzzles. Here Column wants herself and Row to make the 'same' choice,
i.e., $A_1$ and $S_1$ or $A_2$ and $S_2$. She gets 1 if they do, 0
otherwise. And Row wants them to make different choices, and gets 10 if
they do. Row also dislikes playing $A_2$, and this costs her 1 whatever
else happens. It isn't too hard to prove that the only Nash equilibrium
for this game is that Row plays a mixed strategy playing both $A_1$ and
$A_2$ with probability , while Column plays the mixed strategy that
gives $S_1$ probability , and $S_2$ with probability .

Now what is a mixed strategy? It is easy enough to take away form the
standard game theory textbooks a **metaphysical** interpretation of what
a mixed strategy is. Here, for instance, is the paragraph introducing
mixed strategies in Dixit and Skeath's *Games of Strategy*.

> When players choose to act unsystematically, they pick from among
> their pure strategies in some random way ...We call a random mixture
> between these two pure strategies a mixed strategy. [@DixitSkeath2004
> 186]

Dixit and Skeath are saying that it is definitive of a mixed strategy
that players use some kind of randomisation device to pick their plays
on any particular run of a game. That is, the probabilities in a mixed
strategy must be in the world; they must go into the players' choice of
play. That's one way, the paradigm way really, that we can think of
mixed strategies metaphysically.

But the understanding of game theory as interactive epistemology
naturally suggests an **epistemological** interpretation of mixed
strategies.

> [@Stalnaker1994 57-8]

One nice advantage of the epistemological interpretation, as noted by
Binmore [-@Binmore2007 185] is that we don't require players to have
$n$-sided dice in their satchels, for every $n$, every time they play a
game.[^3] But another advantage is that it lets us make sense of the
difference between playing a pure strategy and playing a mixed strategy
where one of the 'parts' of the mixture is played with probability one.

With that in mind, consider the below game, which I'll call Red-Green.
I've said something different about this game in earlier work
[@Weatherson2012-WEAGAT]. But I now think that to understand what's
going on, we need to think about mixed strategies where one element of
the mixture has probability one.

Informally, in this game $A$ and $B$ must each play either a green or
red card. I will capitalise $A$'s moves, i.e., $A$ can play GREEN or
RED, and italicise $B$'s moves, i.e., $B$ can play *green* or *red*. If
two green cards, or one green card and one red card are played, each
player gets \$1. If two red cards are played, each gets nothing. Each
cares just about their own wealth, so getting \$1 is worth 1 util. All
of this is common knowledge. More formally, here is the game table, with
$A$ on the row and $B$ on the column.

::: {.center}
  ------- --------- -------
           *green*   *red*
    GREEN   1, 1     1, 1
      RED   1, 1     0, 0
  ------- --------- -------
:::

When I write game tables like this, and I think this is the usual way
game tables are to be interpreted [@Weatherson2012-WEAKBI], I mean that
the players know that these are the payouts, that the players know the
other players to be rational, and these pieces of knowledge are common
knowledge to at least as many iterations as needed to solve the game.
With that in mind, let's think about how the agents should approach this
game.

I'm going to make one big simplifying assumption at first. We'll relax
this later, but it will help the discussion to start with this
assumption. This assumption is that the doctrine of **Uniqueness**
applies here; there is precisely one rational credence to have in any
salient proposition about how the game will play. Some philosophers
think that Uniqueness always holds [@White2005-WHIEP]. I join with those
such as @North2010 and @Schoenfield2013 who don't. But it does seem like
Uniqueness might *often* hold; there might often be a right answer to a
particular problem. Anyway, I'm going to start by assuming that it does
hold here.

The first thing to note about the game is that it is symmetric. So the
probability of $A$ playing GREEN should be the same as the probability
of $B$ playing *green*, since $A$ and $B$ face exactly the same problem.
Call this common probability $x$. If $x < 1$, we get a quick
contradiction. The expected value, to Row, of GREEN, is 1. Indeed, the
known value of GREEN is 1. If the probability of *green* is $x$, then
the expected value of RED is $x$. So if $x < 1$, and Row is rational,
she'll definitely play GREEN. But that's inconsistent with the claim
that $x < 1$, since that means that it isn't definite that Row will play
GREEN.

So we can conclude that $x = 1$. Does that mean we can know that Row
will play GREEN? No. Assume we could conclude that. Whatever reason we
would have for concluding that would be a reason for any rational person
to conclude that Column will play *green*. Since any rational person can
conclude this, Row can conclude it. So Row knows that she'll get 1
whether she plays GREEN or RED. But then she should be indifferent
between playing GREEN and RED. And if we know she's indifferent between
playing GREEN and RED, and our only evidence for what she'll play is
that she's a rational player who'll maximise her returns, then we can't
be in a position to know she'll play GREEN.

I think the arguments of the last two paragraphs are sound. We'll turn
to an objection presently, but let's note how bizarre is the conclusion
we've reached. One argument has shown that it could not be more probable
that Row will play GREEN. A second argument has shown that we can't know
that Row will play GREEN. It reminds me of examples involving blindspots
[@Sorensen1988]. Consider this case:

(B)  Brian does not know (B).

That's true, right? Assume it's false, so I do know (B). Knowledge is
factive, so (B) is true. But that contradicts the assumption that it's
false. So it's true. But I obviously don't know that it's true; that's
what this very true proposition says.[^4]

Now I'm not going to rest anything on this case, because there are so
many tricky things one can say about blindspots, and about the paradoxes
generally. It does suggest that there are other finite cases where one
can properly have maximal credence in a true proposition without
knowledge.[^5] And, assuming that we shouldn't believe things we know we
don't know, that means we can have maximal credence in things we don't
believe. All I want to point out is that this phenomena of maximal
credence without knowledge, and presumably without full belief, isn't a
quirky feature of self-reference, or of games, or of puzzles about
infinity; it comes up in a wide range of cases.

For the rest of this section I want to reply to one objection, and
weaken an assumption I made earlier. The objection is that I'm wrong to
assume that agents will only maximise expected utility. They may have
tie-breaker rules, and those rules might undermine the arguments I gave
above. The assumption is that there's a uniquely rational credence to
have in any given situation.

I argued that if we knew that $A$ would play GREEN, we could show that
$A$ had no reason to play GREEN. But actually what we showed was that
the expected utility of playing GREEN would be the same as playing RED.
Perhaps $A$ has a reason to play GREEN, namely that GREEN weakly
dominates RED. After all, there's one possibility on the table where
GREEN does better than RED, and none where RED does better. And perhaps
that's a reason, even if it isn't a reason that expected utility
considerations are sensitive to.

Now I don't want to insist on expected utility maximisation as the only
rule for rational decision making. Sometimes, I think some kind of
tie-breaker procedure is part of rationality. In the papers by Stalnaker
I mentioned above, he often appeals to this kind of weak dominance
reasoning to resolve various hard cases. But I don't think weak
dominance provides a reason to play GREEN in this particular case. When
Stalnaker says that agents should use weak dominance reasoning, it is
always in the context of games where the agents' attitude towards the
game matrix is different to their attitude towards each other. One case
that Stalnaker discusses in detail is where the game table is common
knowledge, but there is merely common (justified, true) belief in common
rationality. Given such a difference in attitudes, it does seem there's
a good sense in which the most salient departure from equilibrium will
be one in which the players end up somewhere else on the table. And
given that, weak dominance reasoning seems appropriate.

But that's not what we've got here. Assuming that rationality requires
playing GREEN/*green*, the players know we'll end up in the top left
corner of the table. There's no chance that we'll end up elsewhere. Or,
perhaps better, there is just as much chance we'll end up 'off the
table', as that we'll end up in a non-equilibrium point on the table. To
make this more vivid, consider the 'possibility' that $B$ will play
*blue*, and if $B$ plays *blue*, $A$ will receive 2 if she plays RED,
and -1 if she plays GREEN. Well hold on, you might think, didn't I say
that *green* and *red* were the only options, and this was common
knowledge? Well, yes, I did, but if the exercise is to consider what
would happen if something the agent knows to be true doesn't obtain,
then the possibility that one agent will play blue certainly seems like
one worth considering. It is, after all, a metaphysical possibility. And
if we take it seriously, then it isn't true that under *any* possible
play of the game, GREEN does better than RED.

We can put this as a dilemma. Assume, for *reductio*, that GREEN/*green*
is the only rational play. Then if we restrict our attention to
possibilities that are epistemically open to $A$, then GREEN does just
as well as RED; they both get 1 in every possibility. If we allow
possibilities that are epistemically closed to $A$, then the possibility
where $B$ plays *blue* is just as relevant as the possibility that $B$
is irrational. After all, we stipulated that this is a case where
rationality is common knowledge. In neither case does the weak dominance
reasoning get any purchase.

With that in mind, we can see why we don't need the assumption of
Uniqueness. Let's play through how a failure of Uniqueness could
undermine the argument. Assume, again for **reductio**, that we have
credence $\varepsilon > 0$ that $A$ will play RED. Since $A$ maximises
expected utility, that means $A$ must have credence 1 that $B$ will play
*green*. But this is already odd. Even if you think people can have
different reactions to the same evidence, it is odd to think that one
rational agent could regard a possibility as infinitely less likely than
another, given isomorphic evidence. And that's not all of the problems.
Even if $A$ has credence 1 that $B$ will play *green*, it isn't obvious
that playing RED is rational. After all, relative to the space of
epistemic possibilities, GREEN weakly dominates RED. Remember that we're
no longer assuming that it can be known what $A$ or $B$ will play. So
even without Uniqueness, there are two reasons to think that it is wrong
to have credence $\varepsilon > 0$ that $A$ will play RED. So we've
still shown that credence 1 doesn't imply knowledge, and since the proof
is known to us, and full belief is incompatible with knowing that you
can't know, this is a case where credence 1 doesn't imply full belief.
So whether $A$ plays GREEN, like whether the coin will ever land tails,
is a case the Lockean cannot get right. No matter where they set the
threshold for belief our credence is above that threshold, but we don't
believe.

So I think this case is a real problem for a Lockean view about the
relationship between credence and belief. If *A* is rational, she can
have credence 1 that *B* will play *green*, but won't believe that *B*
will play *green*. But now you might worry that my own account of the
relationship between belief and credence is in just as much trouble.
After all, I said that to believe $p$ is, roughly, to have the same
attitudes towards all salient questions as you have conditional on $p$.
And it's hard to identify a question that rational *A* would answer
differently upon conditionalising on the proposition that *B* plays
*green*.

I think what went wrong in my earlier view was that I'd too quickly
equated updating with conditionalisation. The two can come apart. Here's
an example from @Gillies2010 that makes the point well.[^6]

> I have lost my marbles. I know that just one of them -- Red or Yellow
> -- is in the box. But I don't know which. I find myself saying things
> like ..."If Yellow isn't in the box, the Red must be." (4:13)

As Gillies goes on to point out, this isn't really a problem for the
Ramsey test view of conditionals.

> The Ramsey test -- the schoolyard version, anyway -- is a test for
> when an indicative conditional is acceptable given your beliefs. It
> says that (if *p*)(*q*) is acceptable in belief state *B* iff *q* is
> acceptable in the derived or subordinate state
> *B*-plus-the-information-that-*p*. (4:27)

And he notes that this can explain what goes on with the marbles
conditional. Add the information that Yellow isn't in the box, and it
isn't just true, but must be true, that Red is in the box.

Note though that while we can explain this conditional using the Ramsey
test, we can't explain it using any version of the idea that
probabilities of conditionals are conditional probabilities. The
probability that Red must be in the box is 0. The probability that
Yellow isn't in the box is not 0. So conditional on Yellow not being in
the box, the probability that Red must be in the box is still 0. Yet the
conditional is perfectly assertable.

There is, and this is Gillies's key point, something about the behaviour
of modals in the consequents of conditionals that we can't capture using
conditional probabilities, or indeed many other standard tools. And what
goes for consequents of conditionals goes for updated beliefs too. Learn
that Yellow isn't in the box, and you'll conclude that Red must be. But
that learning can't go via conditionalisation; just conditionalise on
the new information and the probability that Red must be in the box goes
from 0 to 0.

Now it's a hard problem to say exactly how this alternative to updating
by conditionalisation should work. But very roughly, the idea is that at
least some of the time, we update by eliminating worlds from the space
of possibilities. This affects dramatically the probability of
propositions whose truth is sensitive to which worlds are in the space
of possibiilties.

For example, in the game I've been discussing, we should believe that
rational *B* might play *red*. Indeed, the probability of that is, I
think, 1. And whether or not *B* might play red is highly salient; it
matters to the probability of whether *A* will play GREEN or RED.
Conditionalising on something that has probability 1, such as that *B*
will play *green*, can hardly change that probability. But updating on
the proposition that *B* will play *green* can make a difference. We can
see that by simply noting that the conditional *If B plays green, she
might play red* is incoherent.

So I conclude that a theory of belief like mine can handle the puzzle
this game poses, as long as it distinguishes between conditionalising
and updating, in just the way Gillies suggests. To believe that *p* is
to be disposed to not change any attitude towards a salient question on
updating that *p*. (Plus some bells and whistles to deal with
propositions that are not relevant to salient questions. We'll return to
them below.) Updating often goes by conditionalisation, so we can often
say that belief means having attitudes that match unconditionally and
conditionally on *p*. But not all updating works that way, and the
theory of belief needs to acknowledge this.

### Holton on Credence

While I don't agree with the Lockeans, I do endorse a lot of similar
theses to them about the relationship between belief and credence. These
theses include that both beliefs and credences exist and that the two
are constitutively (as opposed to merely causally) connected. I differ
from the Lockeans in holding that both belief and credence have
important explanatory roles, and that the connection between the two
goes via the interests of the agent. As with most work in this area, my
views start off from considerations of cases much like DeRose's famous
bank cases.[^7] Here's another contribution to the genre. I know it's an
overcrowded field, but I wanted a case that (a) is pretty realistic, and
(b) doesn't involve the attribution (either to oneself or others) of a
propositional attitude. In the example, X and Y are parents of a child,
Z.

> Y: This salad you bought is very good. Does it have nuts in it?\
> X: No. The nuttiness you're tasting is probably from the beans.\
> Y: Oh, so we could pack it for Z's lunch tomorrow.\
> X: Hang on, I better check about the nuts. Z's pre-school is very
> fussy about nuts. One of the children there might have an allergy, and
> it would be awful to get in trouble over her lunch.

Here's what I think is going on in that exchange.[^8] At $t_2$ (I'll use
$t_i$ for the time of the $i$'th utterance in the exchange), X believes
that the salad has no nuts in it. Indeed, the one word sentence "No"
expresses that belief. But by $t_4$, X has lost that belief. It would be
fine to pack the salad for lunch if it has no nuts, but X isn't willing
to do this for the simple reason that X no longer believes that it has
no nuts. Moreover, this change of belief was, or at least could have
been for all we've said so far, rational on X's part.

There's something a little puzzling about that. Jacob Ross and Mark
Schroeder [-@SchroederRoss2012] voice a common intuition when they say
that beliefs should only change when new evidence comes in. Indeed, they
use this intuition as a key argument against my view of belief. But X
doesn't get any evidence that bears on the nuttiness of the salad. Yet X
rationally changes beliefs. So I just conclude that sometimes we can
change beliefs without new evidence coming in; sometimes our interests,
broadly construed, change, and that is enough to change beliefs.

We'll come back to Ross and Schroeder's arguments in the next section,
because first I want to concede something to the view that only evidence
changes beliefs. That view is false, but there might be a true view in
the area. And that's the view that only change in evidence can change
*credences*. But that view only makes sense if there are such things as
credences, and that's something that Richard @Holton2013 has recently
launched an intriguing argument against.

Holton's broader project is a much more sweeping attack on the Lockean
thesis than I have proposed. Actually, it is a pair of more sweeping
attacks. One of the pair is that the Lockeans identify something that
exists, namely belief, with something that doesn't, namely high
credence. I would not, could not, sign up for that critique. But I am
much more sympathetic to the other attack in the pair, namely that
credences and beliefs have very different dynamics.

Credences are, by their nature, exceedingly unstable. Whether an agent's
credence that $p$ is above or below any number *x* is liable to change
according to any number of possible changes in evidence. But, at least
if the agent is rational, beliefs are not so susceptible to change.
Holton thinks that rational agents, or at least rational humans,
frequently instantiate the following pattern. They form a belief that
$p$, on excellent grounds. They later get some evidence that $\neg p$.
The evidence is strong enough that, had they had it to begin with, they
would have remained uncertain about $p$. But they do not decide to
reopen the investigation into whether $p$. They hold on to their belief
that $p$, the matter having been previously decided.

Such an attitude might look like unprincipled dogmatism. But it need not
be, I think, as long as four criteria are met. (I think Holton agrees
with these criteria.) One is that the agent's willingness to reopen the
question of whether $p$ must increase. She must be more willing, in the
light of yet more evidence against $p$, to consider whether $p$ is
really true. A second is that, should the agent (irrationally) reopen
the question of whether $p$, she should not use the fact that she
previously closed that question as evidence. Once the genie is out of
the box, only reasoning about $p$ can get it back in. A third is that
the costs of the inquiry must be high enough to warrant putting it off.
If simply turning one's head fifteen degrees to the left will lead to
acquiring evidence that definitively settles whether $p$, it is a little
dogmatic to refuse to do so in the face of evidence against one's
previously formed opinion that $p$. And finally, the costs of being
wrong about $p$ must not be too high. X, in our little dialogue above,
would be terribly dogmatic if they didn't reopen the question of whether
the salad had nuts in it, on being informed that this information was
being used in a high stakes inquiry.

So beliefs should have a kind of resilience. Credences, if they exist,
should not have this kind of resilience. So this suggests that a simple
reduction of belief to credence, as the Lockeans suggest, cannot be
right. You might worry that things are worse, that no reduction of
belief to credence can be compatible with the difference in resilience
between belief and credence. We'll return to that point, because first I
want to look at Holton's stronger claim: that there are no such things
as credences.

Holton acknowledges, as of course he must, that we have probabilistic
truth-directed attitudes. We can imagine a person, call her Paula, who
thinks it's likely that Richard III murdered his nephews, for instance.
But Holton offers several reasons for thinking that in these
probabilistic truth-directed attitudes, the probability goes in the
content, not in the attitude. That is, we should interpret Paula as
believing the probabilistic claim, Richard III probably murdered his
nephews, and not as having some graded attitude towards the simple
proposition *Richard III murdered his nephews*. More precisely, Holton
thinks we should understand Paula's *explicit* attitudes that way, and
that independent of having reason to think that agents explicitly have
probabilistic attitudes, there's no good way to make sense of the claim
that they implicitly have probabilistic attitudes. So there's no such
thing as credences, as usually understood. Or, at least, there's no good
sense to be made of the claim that there are credences.

In response, I want to make six points.

1.  Holton is right about cases like Paula's, and the possibility of
    iterating terms like *probably* provides independent support for
    this view.

2.  Beliefs like the one Paula has are odd; they seem to have very
    strange truth conditions.

3.  Our theory of mind needs some mechanism for explaining the
    relationship between confidence and action.

4.  The 'explanatory gap' here could be filled by positing a binary
    attitude *is more confident that*.

5.  This binary attitude can do all the work that graded attitudes were
    posited to do, and in a (historically sensitive) way saves the
    credences story.

6.  Credences (or at least confidences) can have a key role within a
    Holton-like story about graded belief. They can both explain why
    agents reconsider some beliefs, and provide a standard of
    correctness for decisions to reconsider.

Let's take those in order.

I'm not going to rehearse Holton's argument for the 'content view': that
in cases like Paula's the content of her attitude, and not the attitude
itself, is probabilistic. But I do want to offer one extra consideration
in its favour. (I'm indebted here to work in progress by my colleague
Sarah @MossPragmaticsEpistemicModals, though I'm not sure she'd approve
of this conclusion.) As well as Paula, we can imagine a person Pip who
isn't sure that Paula is right, but thinks she's probably right. That
is, Pip thinks that Richard III probably probably murdered his nephews.
It's easy to make sense of Pip on the content view. Modalities in
propositions iterate smoothly; that's what they are designed to do. But
it's much harder to iterate attitudes. The possibility of cases like Pip
suggests Holton must be right about Paula's case.

But Paula's case is odd. Beliefs have truth conditions. What are the
truth conditions for Paula's belief? On the one hand, it seems they must
be sensitive to her evidence. If she later acquires conclusive evidence
that Richard III was framed, she won't think her earlier self had a
false belief. But if we put the evidence into the content of the belief,
we get the strange result that her belief can't be preserved by uttering
the same words to herself over again. That is, if the content of Paula's
belief is *Given the evidence I have now, Richard III likely murdered
his nephews*, she can't have the very same belief tomorrow by retaining
the thought *Richard III likely murdered his nephews*. And she can't
have a belief with the same content as anyone else by the two of them
both thinking *Richard III likely murdered his nephews*. Those seem like
unhappy conclusions, especially in the midst of a project that wants to
emphasise the resiliency of belief. So perhaps we should say, following
@Stephenson2007 or @MacFarlane2011, that the truth conditions of the
belief are agent-relative. Or, if we're unhappy with the MacFarlane
story, we might be pushed towards a kind of expressivism (perhaps a la
@Yalcin2011), which isn't quite like either the content view or the
attitude view that Holton discusses. I'm personally partial to the
relativist view, but I don't want to argue for that here, just note that
the content view raises some interesting problems, and that natural
solutions to them could in a way blur the boundaries between the content
and attitude views.

As Holton notes in his discussion of Brutus, when our confidence in a
proposition changes, our actions will change. Paula gets a little
evidence that Richard III was framed, and her actions may change. Of
course, not much of what we do in everyday life is sensitive to facts
about English royal history, but there may be some effects. Maybe she'll
be less inclined to speak up if the topic of the princes' murder comes
up, or she'll take a slightly more jaundiced view of Shakespeare's play
(compare @Friend2003.) Holton says that these falling confidences need
not have all the precise structure of credences. In particular, they may
not have the topology of the interval $[0, 1]$. But lots of credence
lovers think that's too demanding. There's a long tradition of thinking
that credences need not all be comparable.[^9] What's important is that
the relative confidences exist, and that they have a robust relationship
to action.

There's an old fashioned way of doing this. The idea is implicit in
@RamseyTruthProb, and made central in @DeFinetti1964. Take the binary
attitude *is more confident that p than q* as primitive. As Holton
notes, surface structure of our attitude reports suggest that this
attitude, unlike the graded attitude of credence, is part of folk
psychology. Lay down some constraints on this attitude. To get enough
constraints that the binary relation determines a unique probability
function, the constraints will have to be very tight. In particular,
you'll need some kind of Archimedean principle, and a principle of
universal comparability. Those aren't very plausible, especially the
second. But even weaker constraints will get you something interesting.
In particular, it isn't hard to lay down enough constraints that there
is a unique set $S$ of probability functions such that the agent is more
confident that $p$ than $q$ just in case $\Pr( p) > \Pr(q)$ for all
$\Pr \in S$. (For much more detail, see for instance @Walley1991.)

In that way, we can derive credences from the relative confidences of a
reasonably coherent agent. But we can do with even less coherence than
that I think. A throwaway remark from @Ramsey1929 provides a key clue.
What is it to have credence $\frac{2}{3}$ in $p$? Don't say it's a
betting disposition; mental states and behavioural dispositions aren't
that tightly linked. Here's Ramsey's idea. To have credence
$\frac{2}{3}$ in $p$ is to be exactly as confident in $p$ as in
$q \vee r$, where $q, r$ and $s$ are taken to be exclusive and
exhaustive, and one has equal confidence in all three. It's easy to see
how to extend that to a definition of credence $\frac{m}{n}$ for any
integer $m, n$. It's a little trickier to say precisely what, say,
credence $\frac{1}{\pi}$ is, but rational credences are probably
credences enough to explain action. And just like that, we have a way of
talking about credences, i.e., graded attitudes, without positing
anything more than a binary attitude *more confident than*.

Perhaps Holton could argue that we only have unary attitudes, not binary
attitudes like *more confident than*. If Maury is more confident that
Oswald shot JFK than that Richard III murdered his nephews, that means
he really believes the proposition *It is more likely that Oswald shot
JFK than that Richard III murdered his nephews*. But such a view seems
forced at best, and isn't motivated by Holton's other arguments for the
'content view'. This attitude of *more confident than* isn't iterable.
It isn't subject to the particular kind of reasoning errors that Holton
takes to be evidence for the content view in the probabilistic case. It
is an attitude we ordinarily report as a binary attitude in normal
speech. In short, it looks like a genuine binary attitude.

Given that the binary attitude exists, and that we can define numerical
(at least rational) credences in terms of it, I'd say that's enough to
say that credences exist. In a sense, credences will be epiphenomenal.
What does the explanatory work is the binary relation *more confident
that*. Maury might stay away from a showing of *Richard III* because he
is less confident that it is historically accurate than he used to be.
We can work out from Maury's other relative confidences what his
credence in Richard III's guilt is and was. Or, at least, we can work
out bounds on these. But those numbers aren't in a fundamental sense
explanatory, and neither are the complicated sets of relative
confidences that constitute the numbers. What's *really* explanatory are
relative confidences. But it's a harmless enough mode of speech to talk
as if credences are explanatory; they are easier to talk about than the
underlying relative confidences.

### The Power of Theoretical Interests

So I think we should accept that credences exist. And we can just about
reduce beliefs to credences. In previous work I argued that we could do
such a reduction. I'm not altogether sure whether the amendments to that
view I'm proposing here means it no longer should count as a reductive
view; we'll come back to that question in the conclusion.

The view I defended in previous work is that the reduction comes through
the relationship between conditional and unconditional attitudes. Very
roughly, to believe that *p* is simply to have the same attitudes,
towards all salient questions, unconditionally as you have conditional
on *p*. In a syrupy slogan, belief means never having to say you've
conditionalised. For reasons I mentioned in section 1, I now think that
was inaccurate; I should have said that belief means never having to say
you've updated, or at least that you've updated your view on any salient
question.

The restriction to salient questions is important. Consider any *p* that
I normally take for granted, but such that I wouldn't bet on it at
insane odds. I prefer declining such a bet to taking it. But conditional
on *p*, I prefer taking the bet. So that means I don't believe any such
*p*. But just about any *p* satisfies that description, for at least
some 'insane' odds. So I believe almost nothing. That would be a
*reductio* of the position. I respond by saying that the choice of
whether to take an insane bet is not normally salient.

But now there's a worry that I've let in too much. For many *p*, there
is no salient decision that they even bear on. What I would do
conditional on *p*, conditional on $\neg p$, and unconditionally is
exactly the same, over the space of salient choices. (And this isn't a
case where updating and conditionalising come apart; I'll leave this
proviso mostly implicit from now on.) So with the restriction in place,
I believe *p* and $\neg p$. That seems like a *reductio* of the view
too. I probably do have inconsistent beliefs, but not in virtue of *p*
being irrelevant to me right now. I've changed my mind a little about
what the right way to avoid this problem is, in part because of some
arguments by Jacob Ross and Mark Schroeder.

They have what looks like, on the surface, a rather different view to
mine. They say that to believe *p* is to have a **default reasoning
disposition** to use *p* in reasoning. Here's how they describe their
own view.

There are, relative to what I'm interested in, three striking
characteristics of Ross and Schroeder's view.

1.  Whether you believe *p* is sensitive to how you reason; that is,
    your theoretical interests matter.

2.  How you would reason about some questions that are not live is
    relevant to whether you believe *p*.

3.  Dispositions can be masked, so you can believe *p* even though you
    don't actually use *p* in reasoning now.

I think they take all three of these points to be reasons to favour
their view over mine. As I see it, we agree on point 1 (and I always had
the resources to agree with them), I can accommodate point 2 with a
modification to my theory, and point 3 is a cost of their theory, not a
benefit. Let's take those points in order.

There are lots of reasons to dislike what Ross and Schroeder call
*Pragmatic Credal Reductionism* (PCR). This is, more or less, the view
that the salient questions, in the sense relevant above, are just those
which are practically relevant to the agent. So to believe $p$ just is
to have the same attitude towards all practically relevant questions
unconditionally as conditional on $p$. There are at least three reasons
to resist this view.

One reason comes from the discussions of Ned Block's example Blockhead
 [@Block1978]. As Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson point out, the lesson to
take from that example is that beliefs are constituted in part by their
relations to other mental states  [@DBMJackson2007 114ff]. There's a
quick attempted refutation of PCR via the Blockhead case which doesn't
quite work. We might worry that if all that matters to belief given PCR
is how it relates to action, PCR will have the implausible consequence
that Blockhead has a rich set of beliefs. That isn't right; PCR is
compatible with the view that Blockhead doesn't have credences, and
hence doesn't have credences that constitute beliefs. But the Blockhead
example's value isn't exhausted by its use in quick refutations.[^10]
The lesson is that beliefs are, by their nature, interactive. It seems
to me that PCR doesn't really appreciate that lesson.

Another reason comes from recent work by Jessica @Brown2013. Compare
these two situations.

1.  *S* is in circumstances *C*, and has to decide whether to do *X*.

2.  *S* is in completely different circumstances to *C*, but is
    seriously engaged in planning for future contingencies. She's
    currently trying to decide whether in circumstances *C* to do *X*.

Intuitively, *S* can bring exactly the same evidence, knowledge and
beliefs to bear on the two problems. If *C* is a particularly high
stakes situation, say it is a situation where one has to decide what to
feed someone with a severe peanut allergy, then a lot of things that can
ordinarily be taken for granted cannot, in this case, be taken for
granted. And that's true whether *S* is actually in *C*, or she is just
planning for the possibility that she finds herself in *C*.

So I conclude that both practical and theoretical interests matter for
what we can take for granted in inquiry. The things we can take for
granted into a theoretical inquiry into what to do in high stakes
contexts as restricted, just as they are when we are in a high stakes
context, and must make a practical decision. Since the latter
restriction on what we can take for granted is explained by (and
possibly constituted by) a restriction on what we actually believe in
those contexts, we should similarly conclude that agents simply believe
less when they are reasoning about high stakes contexts, whatever their
actual context.

A third reason to dislike PCR comes from the 'Renzi' example in Ross and
Schroeder's paper. I'll run through a somewhat more abstract version of
the case, because I don't think the details are particularly important.
Start with a standard decision problem. The agent knows that X is better
to do if *p*, and Y is better to do if $\neg p$. The agent should then
go through calculating the relative gains to doing X or Y in the
situations they are better, and the probability of *p*. But the agent
imagined doesn't do that. Rather, the agent divides the possibility
space in four, taking the salient possibilities to be
$p \wedge q, p \wedge \neg q, \neg p \wedge q$ and
$\neg p \wedge \neg q$, and then calculates the expected utility of X
and Y accordingly. This is a bad bit of reasoning on the agent's part.
In the cases we are interested in, *q* is exceedingly likely. Moreover,
the expected utility of each act doesn't change a lot depending on *q*'s
truth value. So it is fairly obvious that we'll end up making the same
decision whether we take the 'small worlds' in our decision model to be
just the world where *p*, and the world where $\neg p$, or the four
worlds this agent uses. But the agent does use these four, and the
question is what to say about them.

Ross and Schroeder say that such an agent should not be counted as
believing that *q*. If they are consciously calculating the probability
that *q*, and taking $\neg q$ possibilities into account when
calculating expected utilities, they regard *q* as an open question. And
regarding *q* as open in this way is incompatible with believing it. I
agree with all this.

They also think that PCR implies that the agent *does* believe *q*. The
reason is that conditionalising on *q* doesn't change the agent's
beliefs about any practical question. I think that's right too, at least
on a natural understanding of what 'practical' is.

My response to all these worries is to say that whether someone believes
that *p* depends not just on how conditionalising (or more generally
updating) on *p* would affect someone's action, but on how it would
affect their reasoning. That is, just as we learned from the Blockhead
example, to believe that *p* requires having a mental state that is
connected to the rest of one's cognitive life in roughly the way a
belief that *p* should be connected. Let's go through both the last two
cases to see how this works on my theory.

One of the things that happens when the stakes go up is that
conditionalising on very probable things can change the outcome of
interesting decisions. Make the probability that some nice food is
peanut-free be high, but short of one. Conditional on it being
peanut-free, it's a good thing to give to a peanut-allergic guest. But
unconditionally, it's a bad thing to give to such a guest, because the
niceness of the food doesn't outweigh the risk of killing them. And
that's true whether the guest is actually there, or you're just thinking
about what to do should such a guest arrive in the future. In general,
the same questions will be relevant whether you're in *C* trying to
decide whether to do *X*, or simply trying to decide whether to *X* in
*C*. In one case they will be practically relevant questions, in the
other they will be theoretically relevant questions. But this feels a
lot like a distinction without a difference, since the agent should have
similar beliefs in the two cases.

The same response works for Ross and Schroeder's case. The agent was
trying to work out the expected utility of X and Y by working out the
utility of each action in each of four 'small worlds', then working out
the probability of each of these. Conditional on *q*, the probability of
two of them ($p \wedge \neg q, \neg p \wedge \neg q$), will be 0.
Unconditionally, this probability won't be 0. So the agent has a
different view on some question they have taken an interest in
unconditionally to their view conditional on *q*. So they don't believe
*q*. The agent shouldn't care about that question, and conditional on
each question they should care about, they have the same attitude
unconditionally and conditional on *q*. But they do care about these
probabilistic questions, so they don't believe *q*.

So I think that Ross and Schroeder and I agree on point 1; something
beyond practical interests is relevant to belief.

They have another case that I think does suggest a needed revision to my
theory. I'm going to modify their case a little to change the focus a
little, and to avoid puzzles about vagueness. (What follows is a version
of their example about Dalı́'s moustache, purged of any worries about
vagueness, and without the focus on consistency. I don't think the
problem they true to press on me, that my theory allows excessive
inconsistency of belief among rational agents, really sticks. Everyone
will have to make qualifications to consistency to deal with the preface
paradox, and for reasons I went over in  [@Weatherson2005-WEACWD], I
think the qualifications I make are the best ones to make.)

Let *D* be the proposition that the number of games the Detroit Tigers
won in 1976 (in the MLB regular season) is not a multiple of 3. At most
times, *D* is completely irrelevant to anything I care about, either
practically or theoretically. My attitudes towards any relevant question
are the same unconditionally as conditional on *D*. So there's a worry
that I'll count as believing *D*, and believing $\neg D$, by default.

In earlier work, I added a clause meant to help with cases like this. I
said that for determining whether an agent believes that *p*, we should
treat the question of whether *p*'s probability is above or below 0.5 as
salient, even if the agent doesn't care about it. Obviously this won't
help with this particular case. The probability of *D* is around , and
is certainly above 0.5. My 'fix' avoids the consequence that I
implausibly count as believing $\neg D$. But I still count, almost as
implausibly, as believing *D*. This needs to be fixed.

Here's my proposed change. For an agent to count as believing *p*, it
must be possible for *p* to do some work for them in reasoning. Here's
what I mean by work. Consider a very abstract set up of a decision
problem, as follows.

::: {.center}
  --- ----- -----
       *p*   *q*
    X   4     1
    Y   3     2
  --- ----- -----
:::

That table encodes a lot of information. It encodes that $p \vee q$ is
true; otherwise there are some columns missing. It encodes that the only
live choices are X or Y; otherwise there are rows missing. It encodes
that doing X is better than doing Y if *p*, and worse if *q*.

For any agent, and any decision problem, there is a table like this that
they would be disposed to use to resolve that problem. Or, perhaps,
there are a series of tables and there is no fact about which of them
they would be most disposed to use.

Given all that terminology, here's my extra constraint on belief. To
believe that *p*, there must be some decision problem such that some
table the agent would be disposed to use to solve it encodes that *p*.
If there is no such problem, the agent does not believe that *p*. For
anything that I intuitively believe, this is an easy condition to
satisfy. Let the problem be whether to take a bet that pays 1 if *p*,
and loses 1 otherwise. Here's the table I'd be disposed to use to solve
the problem.

::: {.center}
  ------------- -----
                 *p*
       Take bet   1
    Decline bet   0
  ------------- -----
:::

This table encodes that *p*, so it is sufficient to count as believing
that *p*. And it doesn't matter that this bet isn't on the table. I'm
disposed to use this table, so that's all that matters.

But might there be problems in the other direction. What about an agent
who, if offered such a bet on *D*, would use such a simple table? I
simply say that they believe that *D*. I would not use any such table.
I'd use this table.

::: {.center}
  ------------- ----- ----------
                 *D*   $\neg D$
       Take bet   1      --1
    Decline bet   0       0
  ------------- ----- ----------
:::

Now given the probability of *D*, I'd still end up taking the bet; it
has an expected return of . (Well, actually I'd probably decline the bet
because being offered the bet would change the probability of *D* for
reasons made clear in  @RunyonGuysDolls [14--15]. But that hardly
undermines the point I'm making.) But this isn't some analytic fact
about me, or even I think some respect in which I'm obeying the dictates
of rationality. It's simply a fact that I wouldn't take *D* for granted
in any inquiry. And that's what my non-belief that *D* consists in.

This way of responding to the Tigers example helps respond to a nice
observation that Ross and Schroeder make about correctness. A belief
that *p* is, in some sense, *incorrect* if $\neg p$. It isn't altogether
clear how to capture this sense given a simple reduction of beliefs to
credences. I propose to capture it using this idea that decision tables
encode propositions. A table is incorrect if it encodes something that's
false. To believe something is, *inter alia*, to be disposed to use a
table that encodes it. So if it is false, it involves a disposition to
do something incorrect.

It also helps capture Holton's observation that beliefs should be
resilient. If someone is disposed to use decision tables that encode
that *p*, that disposition should be fairly resilient. And to the extent
that it is resilient, they will satisfy all the other clauses in my
preferred account of belief. So anyone who believes *p* should have a
resilient belief that *p*.

The last point is where I think my biggest disagreement with Ross and
Schroeder lies. They think it is very important that a theory of belief
vindicate a principle they call **Stability**.

> **Stability**: A fully rational agent does not change her beliefs
> purely in virtue of an evidentially irrelevant change in her credences
> or preferences. (20)

Here's the kind of case that is meant to motivate Stability, and show
that views like mine are in tension with it.

Ross and Schroeder's own view is that if Stella has a defeasible
disposition to treat as true the proposition that steel is stronger than
Styrofoam, that's enough for her to believe it. And that can be true if
the disposition is not only defeasible, but actually defeated in the
circumstances Stella is in. This all strikes me as just as implausible
as the failure of Stability. Let's go over its costs.

The following propositions are clearly not mutually consistent, so one
of them must be given up. We're assuming that Stella is facing, and
knows she is facing, a bet that pays a penny if steel is stronger than
Styrofoam, and costs her life if steel is not stronger than Styrofoam.

1.  Stella believes that steel is stronger than Styrofoam.

2.  Stella believes that if steel is stronger than Styrofoam, she'll win
    a penny and lose nothing by taking the bet.

3.  If 1 and 2 are true, and Stella considers the question of whether
    she'll win a penny and lose nothing by taking the bet, she'll
    believe that she'll win a penny and lose nothing by taking the bet.

4.  Stella prefers winning a penny and losing nothing to getting
    nothing.

5.  If Stella believes that she'll win a penny and lose nothing by
    taking the bet, and prefers winning a penny and losing nothing to
    getting nothing, she'll take the bet.

6.  Stella won't take the bet.

It's part of the setup of the problem that 2 and 4 are true. And it's
common ground that 6 is true, at least assuming that Stella is rational.
So we're left with 1, 3 and 5 as the possible candidates for falsehood.

Ross and Schroeder say that it's implausible to reject 1. After all,
Stella believed it a few minutes ago, and hasn't received any evidence
to the contrary. And I guess rejecting 1 isn't the most intuitive
philosophical conclusion I've ever drawn. But compare the alternatives!

If we reject 3, we must say that Stella will simply refuse to infer *r*
from *p*, *q* and $(p \wedge q) \rightarrow r$. Now it is notoriously
hard to come up with a general principle for closure of beliefs. But it
is hard to see why this particular instance would fail. And in any case,
it's hard to see why Stella wouldn't have a general, defeasible,
disposition to conclude *r* in this case, so by Ross and Schroeder's own
lights, it seems 3 should be acceptable.

That leaves 5. It seems on Ross and Schroeder's view, Stella simply must
violate a very basic principle of means-end reasoning. She desires
something, she believes that taking the bet will get that thing, and
come with no added costs. Yet, she refuses to take the bet. And she's
rational to do so! At this stage, I think I've lost what's meant to be
belief-like about their notion of belief. I certainly think attributing
this kind of practical incoherence to Stella is much less plausible than
attributing a failure of Stability to her.

Put another way, I don't think presenting Stability on its own as a
desideratum of a theory is exactly playing fair. The salient question
isn't whether we should accept or reject Stability. The salient question
is whether giving up Stability is a fair price to pay for saving basic
tenets of means-end rationality. And I think that it is. Perhaps there
will be some way of understanding cases like Stella's so that we don't
have to choose between theories of belief that violate Stability
constraints, and theories of belief that violate coherence constraints.
But I don't see one on offer, and I'm not sure what such a theory could
look like.

I have one more argument against Stability, but it does rest on somewhat
contentious premises. There's often a difference between the best
*methodology* in an area, and the correct *epistemology* of that area.
When that happens, it's possible that there is a good methodological
rule saying that if such-and-such happens, re-open a certain inquiry.
But that rule need not be epistemologically significant. That is, it
need not be the case that the happening of such-and-such provides
evidence against the conclusion of the inquiry. It just provides a
reason that a good researcher will re-open the inquiry. And, as we've
stated above, an open inquiry is incompatible with belief.

Here's one way that might happen. Like other non-conciliationists about
disagreement, e.g.,  @Kelly2010-KELPDA, I hold that disagreement by
peers with the same evidence as you doesn't provide *evidence* that you
are wrong. But it might provide an excellent reason to re-open an
inquiry. We shouldn't draw conclusions about the methodological
significance of disagreement from the epistemology of disagreement. So
learning that your peers all disagree with a conclusion might be a
reason to re-open inquiry into that conclusion, and hence lose belief in
the conclusion, without providing evidence that the conclusion is false.
This example rests on a very contentious claim about the epistemology of
disagreement. But any gap that opens up between methodology and
epistemology will allow such an example to be constructed, and hence
provide an independent reason to reject Stability.

### Conclusion

You might well worry that the view here is too *complex* to really be a
theory of belief. Belief is a simple state; why all the epicycles? This
is a good question, and I'm not sure I have a sufficiently good answer
to it.

At heart, the theory I've offered here is simple. To believe *p* is to
take *p* for granted, to take it as given, to take it as a settled
question. But one doesn't take a question as settled in a vacuum. I will
take some questions as settled in some circumstances and not others.
It's here that the complexities enter in.

To believe *p*, it isn't necessary that we take it as settled in all
contexts. That would mean that anything one believes one would bet on at
any odds. But it isn't sufficient to take it as settled in some context
or other. If I'm facing a tricky bet on *p*, the fact that I'd take *p*
as settled in some other context doesn't mean that I believe *p*. After
all, I might even decline the bet, although I desire the reward for
winning the bet, and believe that if *p* I will win. And we can't just
focus on the actual circumstances. Five minutes ago, I neither took it
as settled or as open that the Cubs haven't won the World Series for
quite a while. I simply wasn't thinking about that proposition, and
didn't really take it to be one thing or another.

This is why things get so complex. To believe *p* is to hold a fairly
simple attitude towards *p* in some relevant circumstances. But which
circumstances? That's what's hard to say, and it's why the theory is so
messy. And I think we have an argument that it must be a little hard to
say, namely an argument by exhaustion of all the possible simple things
to say. The previous paragraph starts such an argument.

I'd be a little surprised if the account here is the best or last word
on the matter though. It does feel a little disjunctive, as if there is
a simpler reduction to be had. But I think it's better than what came
before, so I'm putting it forward.

The previous version of the theory I put forward was clearly reductive;
beliefs were reduced to credences and preferences. This version is not
quite as clearly reductive. Which decision tables the agent is disposed
to use, and which propositions those tables encode, are not obviously
facts about credences and preferences. So it feels like I've given up on
the reductive project.

I'm not altogether happy about this; reduction is a good aim to have.
But if reduction of belief to other states fails, I'd think this kind of
reason is why it is going to fail. Facts about how an agent
conceptualises a problem, how she sets up the decision table, are
distinct from facts about which values she writes into the table. This
is the deepest reason why the Lockean theory is false. Belief is not the
difference between one column in the decision table getting probability
0.98 rather than 0.97; it is the difference between one column being
excluded rather than included. If that difference can't be accounted for
in terms of actual credences and preferences, the reductionist project
will fail.

[^1]: If there's any gap in Williamson's argument, it is I think at the
    point where he concludes that any two infinite sequences of coin
    flips have the same probability of landing all heads. I think that
    the defender of non-numerical, comparative approaches to probability
    can deny that with some plausibility. Perhaps the two sequences of
    coin flips have *incomparable* probabilities of landing all heads.
    But this leads us into complications that are irrlevant to this
    paper, especially since I think it turns out there is a sound
    Williamsonian argument against the Lockean who lets different
    sequences have incomparable probabilities. For a more pessimistic
    take on Williamson's argument, see @Weintraub2008.

[^2]: I'm grateful to the participants in a game theory seminar at Arché
    in 2011, especially Josh Dever and Levi Spectre, for very helpful
    discussions that helped me see through my previous confusions.

[^3]: Actually, I guess it is worse than if some games have the only
    equilibria involving mixed strategies with irrational probabilities.
    And it might be noted that Binmore's introduction of mixed
    strategies, on page 44 of his [-@Binmore2007], sounds much more like
    the metaphysical interpretation. But I think the later discussion is
    meant to indicate that this is just a heuristic introduction; the
    epistemological interpretation is the correct one.

[^4]: It's received wisdom in philosophy that one can never properly say
    something of the form *p, but I don't know that p*. This is used as
    a data point in views as far removed from each other as those
    defended in @Heal1994 and @Williamson1996-WILKAA. But I don't feel
    the force of this alleged datum at all, and (B) is just one reason.
    For a different kind of case that makes the same point, see
    @MaitraWeatherson.

[^5]: As an aside, the existence of these cases is why I get so
    irritated when epistemologists try to theorise about 'Gettier Cases'
    as a class. What does (B) have in common with inferences from a
    justified false belief, or with otherwise sound reasoning that is
    ever so close to issuing in a false conclusion due to relatively bad
    luck? As far as I can tell, the class of justified true beliefs that
    aren't knowledge is a disjunctive mess, and this should matter for
    thinking about the nature of knowledge. For further examples, see
    @WilliamsonLofoten and @Nagel2013-Williamson.

[^6]: A similar example is in Kratzer [-@Kratzer2012 94].

[^7]: The idea of using allergies to illustrate the kind of case we're
    interested in is due to @SchroederRoss2012, and I'm grateful for the
    idea. It makes the intuitions much more vivid. The kind of cases
    we're considering play a big role in, *inter alia*, @DeRose1992
    [@Cohen1999] and @Fantl2002.

[^8]: What I say here obviously has some similarities to a view put
    forward by Jennifer @Nagel2008, but I ultimately end up drawing
    rather different conclusions to the ones she draws.

[^9]: Notable members of the tradition include @Levi1974, @Jeffrey1983
    and @vanFraassen1989.

[^10]: The point I'm making here is relevant I think to recent debates
    about the proper way to formalise counterexamples in philosophy, as
    in  [@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17; @IchikawaJarvis2009; @Malmgren2011].
    I worry that too much of that debate is focussed on the role that
    examples play in one-step refutations. But there's more, much more,
    to a good example than that.
