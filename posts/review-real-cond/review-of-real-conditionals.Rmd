Over the last two decades, William Lycan's work on the semantics of
conditionals has been distinguished by his careful attention to the
connection between syntax and semantics, and more generally by his
impeccible methodology. Lycan takes compositionality seriously, so in
his theory the meaning of 'even if', for example, should be a
combination of the meaning of 'even' and the meaning of 'if'. After
reading his work, it's hard to take seriously work which does not share
this methodology.

Lycan's semantics for conditionals makes central use of what
he calls 'events'. An event is not a possible world, for it need not be
complete or consistent. It is more like what Barwise and Perry call a
'situation'. Conditionals are quantifiers over events, as follows:

- P if Q = P in any event in which Q
- P only if Q = P in no event other than one in which Q
- P even if Q = P in any event including any in which Q (17)


The quantifiers here are contextually restricted. Lycan includes in the
semantic analysis a predicate of events *R*, whose role is to restrict
the quantifiers over events. An event satisfies *R* only if it is
'envisaged', which is similar to saying it is a 'real' or 'relevant'
possibility. The value of *R* changes frequently; sometimes it even
changes mid-sentence. This fact is appealed to frequently in explaining
some surprising behaviour of conditionals. For example, the invalidity
of antecedent-strengthening: *if p then r*, *so if p and q then r*, is
explained by saying the class of events relevant to the truth of the
conclusion may be larger than the class of events relevant to the truth
of the premise. In particular, at least one event in which *p* *and
q* is relevant to the conclusion, but no such event need be relevant to
the premise. A similar explanation is given for the failure of
transitivity and contraposition.

The quantifier domain must include some non-actual events or
conditionals will turn into material implications. Surprisingly, Lycan
says that sometimes the quantifier includes only non-actual events. In
these cases, it is possible that all (relevant) *p*-events can
be *q*-events, even though *p* is true but not *q*. That is, in these
cases modus ponens is invalid. Lycan argues persuasively that the case
against modus ponens is at least as strong as the case against
antecedent-strengthening, contraposition and modus tollens.

There is an extended discussion of 'even', which is
necessary for providing a theory of 'even if'. Lycan first suggests
that *Even Grannie was sober* means *Everyone, including Grannie*, *was
sober*. The quantifier domain includes everyone no less likely than
Grannie to be sober. After discussing some counterexamples, Lycan
suggests that instead it means *Everyone plus Grannie was sober*, where
the quantifer ranges over everyone whom you would expect to be sober.
Lycan is committed to 'even' being a quantifier because of its syntactic
similarity to 'only', and because of the "initial plausibility of ...
universally quantified paraphrases" (121) of sentences involving 'even'.
The discussion here is fascinating, but not conclusive. It isn't clear,
for example, that 'even' and 'only' have the same syntactic role.
Compare *Even supposing Jack were here, he wouldn't help* with \**Only
supposing Jack were here, he wouldn't help*.

Lycan also includes a helpful discussion of how his theory
handles Allan Gibbard's 'Riverboat Puzzle' and related cases. It is
troubling, for those who don't analyse conditionals as material
implications, that sometimes one speaker can say *If p, q*, another can
say *If p, not q*, and both seem to be speaking truly. Lycan argues we
should accept this troubling consequence, but explain it by
making *R* sensitive to epistemic considerations.

As well as these points, Lycan raises some powerful
objections to 'No Truth Value' theories of conditionals, and against the
extensive use of probability theory in semantics. The book concludes
with two appendicies on 'non-conditional' conditionals, such as *If
you're hungry, there's biscuits on the sideboard*.

There's a lot to like about this book, not least it's witty,
even charming, style. Lycan considers more examples, from more diverse
sources, than most writers. The theory he presents is innovative and at
least aims to be comprehensive. And of course there are some good
arguments for it. Despite this there are, as always, occasional grounds
for complaint.

Although Lycan is very careful to get the syntax of 'if'
right, and proves that unlike 'and' and 'or' it is not a co-ordinating
conjunction, it is not so clear that the syntactic evidence provides
distinctive support for his semantic theory. If it's consistent with the
syntax to say *p if q* means *All relevant q-events are p-events*, it's
consistent with the syntax to say that it means *All nearby q-worlds are
p-worlds*. So the syntactic argument for preferring Lycan's theory, to,
say, Stalnaker's, is not obviously overpowering. Lycan suggests that we
can naturally paraphrase conditionals as quantifications over events,
but since he is using *event* 'in a slightly uncommon way' (17) it is
not obvious what support this gives for his theory.

There are few reasons to favour the use of events rather
than worlds in the analysis. The fact that events can be incomplete
seems to only cause complications for the theory. The fact that they can
be inconsistent is used to rescue some intuitions about conditionals
with impossible antecedents, but many would argue those intuitions
should be discarded.

But the main worry is that Lycan needs to say more about
some key notions, particularly about his *R* and about validity. In the
discussion of the Riverboat Puzzle, Lycan says, "I do not have a good
enough intuitive handle on my own notion of 'relevance' to provide a
crushing answer [to a question about why certain events are not covered
by *R*]." (173)  Lycan says that for an event to be *R*, "the utterer
must have it at least tacitly in mind as a live prospect." (19) All
events in *R* are 'envisaged', to use the term he lands on. But "there
is somethig slightly artificial or stylized about 'envisaging' ...
'Envisaging' is not a purely *de facto* cognitive or other psychological
state." (30) The upshot is that the envisaged possibilities are some,
but not always all, of those that are (possibly tacitly) regarded as
live. Just which possibilities then? We are never given a specific
account. Any account we do get is, as in the above quote, almost
immediately qualified. Since *R* does so much work, the reader is
probably owed a little more here. (This point is made at greater length
in Ken Turner's excellent review of *Real Conditionals* in the *Journal
of Pragmatics* forthcoming.)

We are also never specifically given an account of validity.
We are told that several argument forms, from antecedent-strengthening
to modus ponens, are invalid. This seems to mean that one could assert
their premises then reject, or a least decline to assert, their
conclusion. It's important that this process of assertion and rejection
take place in real time, because the value of *R* needs to change for
the arguments to be invalid. Lycan has some arguments that this
conception of validity is the philosophically interesting one, but this
deserves more treatment. The logical reforms it draws in go well beyond
the logic of conditionals. On Lycan's approach, *All swans are white, so
all Australian swans are white* is, presumably, invalid, since the scope
of the quantifier could change from premise to conclusion. And
contraposition fails for valid arguments. Contraposed modus ponens: *p,
not q, so not if p, q* is valid, but modus ponens is not.

None of this is to deny that *Real Conditionals* is a great
contribution to the literature, and if it causes more theorists to pay
serious attention to Lycan's Event Theory, that would be an excellent
consequence.
