title: "Humeans Aren't Out of Their Minds"
description: |
  Humeans about causation say that in some situations, whether C causes E depends on events far away from C and E. John Hawthorne has objected to this feature of the view. Whether one has a mind depends on what causal relations obtain between the parts of one's brain. But whether one has a mind does not depend on what happens far far away. I reply on behalf of the Humean. In the cases Hawthorne is worried about, the Humean can and should deny the problematic long-range dependence. One advantage of Humeanism is that it lets us make sense of the idea that the laws could be different in different parts of the universe. In the cases Hawthorne is worried about, that's exactly what is happening - the laws are different here to how they are over there. And what causal relations obtain here is only dependent on what happens in places the laws are the same.

Humeanism is "the thesis that the whole truth about a world like ours
supervenes on the spatiotemporal distribution of local qualities."
[@Lewis1994a 473] Since the whole truth about our world contains truths
about causation, causation must be located in the mosaic of local
qualities that the Humean says constitute the whole truth about the
world. The most natural ways to do this involve causation being in some
sense extrinsic. To take the simplest possible Humean analysis, we might
say that *c* causes *e* iff throughout the mosaic events of the same
type as *c* are usually followed by events of type *e*. For short, the
causal relation is the constant conjunction relation. Whether this
obtains is determined by the mosaic, so this is a Humean theory, but it
isn't determined just by *c* and *e* themselves, so whether *c* causes
*e* is extrinsic to the pair. Now this is obviously a bad theory of
causation, but the fact that causation is extrinsic is retained even by
good Humean theories of causation. John @Hawthorne2004-Humeans objects
to this feature of Humeanism. I'm going to argue that his arguments
don't work, but first we need to clear up three preliminaries about
causation and intrinsicness.

</aside>

First, my wording so far has been cagey because I haven't wanted to say
that Humeans typically take causation to be an extrinsic *relation*.
That's because the greatest Humean of them all, David Lewis, denies that
causation is a relation at all, and hence that it is an extrinsic
relation [@Lewis2004d]. We can go some way to avoiding this complication
by talking, as Hawthorne does, about properties of regions, and asking
the property of containing a duplicate of *c* that causes a duplicate of
*e* is intrinsic or extrinsic.[^1] Humeans typically take causation to
be extrinsic in this sense.

Second, nothing in Humeanism *requires* that causation is extrinsic in
that sense. If one analysed causation as *that intrinsic relation that
actually most tightly correlates with the constant conjunction
relation*, then one would have guaranteed that causation was an
intrinsic relation. Moreover, one would have a perfectly Humean theory
of causation. (A perfectly awful theory, to be sure, but still a Humean
one.) Peter @Menzies1996 [@Menzies1999] develops a more sophisticated
version of such a theory, and though Menzies describes his view as
anti-Humean, one can locate the relation we've defined here in the
Humean mosaic, so such an approach might be consistent with Humeanism in
the intended sense.

Third, there is good reason, independent of Humeanism, to accept that
causation is extrinsic. As Ned @Hall2004 argues, it is very hard to
square the intrinsicness of causation with the possibility of causation
by omission. Given the choice between these two, I'm going to accept
causation by omission without much hesitation. There is one powerful
objection to the possibility of causation by omission, namely that if
there is any causation by omission then there is a lot more than is
intuitively plausible. But since Sarah @McGrath2005 has a good response
to that objection, I feel happy accepting there is causation by
omission. So I accept that causation is extrinsic, for reasons totally
independent of Humeanism. Since Hawthorne appeals to no feature of
Humeanism beyond the Humean's acceptance of the extrinsicness of
causation, we can take his argument to be an argument against the causal
extrinsicalist, i.e. the theorist who accepts causation is extrinsic in
the above sense. To see that the argument doesn't go through, we need to
consider what exactly the causal extrinsicalist is committed to. I'll
explore this by looking at some other examples of properties of regions.

Some regions contain uncles and some do not. This seems to be an
extrinsic property of regions. My house does not contain any uncles
right now, but there are duplicates of it, in worlds where my brothers
have children, where it does contain an uncle, namely my counterpart.
Consider the smallest region containing the earth from the stratosphere
in from the earth's formation to its destruction. Call this region *e*.
Any duplicate of *e* also contains uncles, including several uncles of
mine. You can't duplicate the earth without producing a duplicate of me
who is, in the duplicate world, the nephew of the duplicates of my
uncles. So it is intrinsic to *e* that it contain an uncle, even though
this is an extrinsic property of regions. (There is much more discussion
of extrinsic properties that are possessed intrinsically in
@Humberstone1996.)

This possibility, that a region might intrinsically possess an extrinsic
property, poses a problem for Hawthorne's argument. Here is his
presentation of it.

> 1.  An intrinsic duplicate of any region wholly containing me will
>     contain a being with my conscious life.
>
> 2.  There are causal requirements on my conscious life.
>
> Therefore, Humeanism is false. [@Hawthorne2004-Humeans 351-352]

The problem is that this argument isn't valid. What follows from (1) and
(2) is that any region containing Hawthorne must possess some causal
properties intrinsically. (As Hawthorne argues on page 356.) And what
Humeanism entails is that causal properties are extrinsic properties of
regions. But there is no incompatibility here, for it is possible that
extrinsic properties are possessed intrinsically, as we saw in the
discussion of uncles.

Hawthorne's argument would go through if Humeans, and causal
extrinsicalists more generally, were committed to the stronger claim
that regions never possess causal properties intrinsically. But it
doesn't seem that Humeans *should* be committed to this claim. Consider
again *e* and all its duplicates. Any such duplicate will contain a
duplication of the event of Booth's shooting Lincoln, and Lincoln
dying.[^2] Will it also be the case that duplicate-Booth's shooting in
this world *causes* duplicate-Lincoln's dying? If so, and this seems
true, then it is intrinsic to *e* that it contains an event of a
shooting causing a dying, even though the property of containing a
shooting causing a dying is extrinsic.

It would be a bad mistake to offer the following epistemological
argument that in all duplicates of *e*, duplicate-Booth's shooting
causes duplicate-Lincoln's dying.

1.  If there was a duplicate of *e* where duplicate-Booth's shooting
    does not cause duplicate-Lincoln's dying, then we would not know
    whether Booth's shooting causes Lincoln's dying without
    investigating what happens outside *e*.

2.  We can know that Booth's shooting caused Lincoln's dying without
    investigating outside *e*.

3.  So, there is no duplicate of *e* where duplicate-Booth's shooting
    does not cause duplicate-Lincoln's dying.

The problem with this argument is that even there are worlds containing
such duplicates, we might know a priori that we do not live in such a
world, just as we know a priori that we do not live in a world where
certain kinds of sceptical scenarios unfold
[@Hawthorne2002; @WeathersonSRE].

A better argument against the existence of such a world is that if it is
possible, it should be conceivable. But it is basically impossible to
conceive such a world. Even if throughout the universe shootings like
Booth's are usually followed by something other than dying, say that
shooting in most parts of the universe causes diseases to be cured, the
large-scale regularity within *e* (or its duplicate) of shootings being
followed by dying suffices to ground the claim that shootings cause
dyings in a good Humean theory. The crucial assumption here is that
*local* regularities count for more than *global* regularities. If the
local regularities deviate too far from the global regularities, then
Humeans can and should say that different nomic claims (and hence causal
claims) are true in this part of the world to the rest of the universe.
If they say this, they can say that regions can have causal features
(such as containing a shooting causing a dying) intrinsically even
though causal features are extrinsic properties.

To illustrate the kind of Humean theory that would have such a
consequence, consider the following variant on the constant conjunction
theory of causation. The theory I'm imagining says that *c* causes *e*
iff whenever an event of the same type as *c* occurs within a 50 mile
radius of where *c* occurred, it was followed by an event of type *e*.
Call this the 50 mile constant conjunction theory of causation.[^3] On
the 50 mile constant conjunction theory of causation, it won't be
intrinsic to Ford's Theatre that it contained a causal event involving
Booth shooting Lincoln, but it will be intrinsic to any sphere of radius
50 miles or more centred on the theatre that it contains such a causal
event. So on this theory causal properties can be intrinsic to a region,
though they are still extrinsic properties of such a region.

That's a very implausible Humean theory, but when we look at the details
of David Lewis's Humean picture, we can see the outlines of a more
plausible theory with the same consequences. Lewis of course doesn't
offer a simple regularity theory of causation. Rather, he first argues
that laws are the extremely simple, extremely informative true
propositions [@Lewis1973a 73]. That is, he offers a sophisticated
regularity theory of laws. Then he analyses counterfactual dependence in
terms of lawhood [@Lewis1973a; @Lewis1979c]. Finally he analyses
causation in terms of counterfactual dependence [@Lewis2004a]. The
philosophical theory meets the Humean mosaic most closely on the issue
of what a law is. If we can offer a theory of laws that allows extra
sensitivity to local facts, while remaining Humean, we can plug this
back into Lewis's theories concerning counterfactual dependence and
hence causation without upsetting its Humean credentials.

Now there is a good reason to think that a Humean theory of laws should
be locally sensitive. (I'm indebted here to long ago conversations with
James Chase.) Humeans typically believe in fairly unrestricted
principles of recombination. And they believe that laws are not
necessarily true. So there could be worlds with very different laws. So
there is a world which 'patches' together part of the world with laws
*L*~1~ with a world with laws *L*~2~. If the parts are large and
isolated enough, it would be foolish to say that within those parts
nothing is law-governed, or that within those regions there is no
counterfactual dependence, or no causation. Much better to say that
regularities obtaining within such a region are sufficiently simple and
informative to count as laws. In our patchwork world, the laws might
simply say *In r*~1~, *L*~1~ *and in r*~2~, *L*~2~. Provided the terms
denoting the regions are not too gruesome, these will plausibly be
Humean, even Lewisian, laws.

Let's bring all this back to Hawthorne's example. Hawthorne argues that
certain causal facts are intrinsic to the region containing his body.
The challenge for the Humean is to say how this could be so when
Hawthorne could be embedded in a world where very different regularities
obtain. The simple answer is to say that in such worlds, laws like *In
r, L*, where *r* picks out the region Hawthorne's body occupies, and *L*
picks out a real-world law, will be true, simple and informative. It is
informative because any duplicate of Hawthorne's body is a very
complicated entity, containing billions of billions of particles
interacting in systematic ways, ways that are nicely summarised by
real-world laws. Simplicity is a little harder to make out, but note
that there is a reasonably sharp boundary between Hawthorne's body and
the rest of the world (Lewis 1993), so there should be a natural enough
way to pick it out. In other words, even if we embed a Hawthorne
duplicate in a world with very different regularities, Humeans will
still have good reason to say that the laws, and hence the facts about
counterfactual dependence and causation, inside that duplicate are not
changed. So not only is it logically possible that Hawthorne's premises
are true and his conclusion false, we can motivate a Humean position
that endorses the truth of Hawthorne's premises and the falsity of the
conclusion.

Since Hawthorne's argument is invalid then, we can accept the premises
without giving up Humeanism. But I think it is worthwhile to note that
his (1) also can be questioned. Hawthorne notes that it is rejected by
those such as Dretske and Lewis who say that phenomenal character is
determined in part by kind membership. (See @Lycan2001 for a longer
defence of this kind of rejection of (1).) Hawthorne thinks that the
intuitive plausibility of (1) constitutes a serious objection to those
views. But by reflecting a little on the phenomenology of what I'll call
*totality qualia*, we can undermine the intuitive case for (1).

Tweedledee is facing a perfectly symmetrical scene. His visual field is
symmetric, with two gentle mountains rising to his left and his right
and a symmetric plain in between them. All he can hear are two birds
singing in perfect harmony, one behind his left ear and one behind his
right ear. The smells of the field seem to envelope him rather than
coming from any particular direction. There is a cool breeze blowing
directly on his face. It's a rather pleasant scene, and the overwhelming
feeling is one of *symmetry*.

Tweedledum is very much like Tweedledee. Indeed, Tweedledum contains a
duplicate of Tweedledee as a proper part. But Tweedledum also has some
sensors in his skin, and brain cells in what corresponds to a
suspiciously empty part of Tweedledee's brain, that allow him to detect,
and *feel*, where the magnetic fields are in the vicinity. And sadly,
though Tweedledum is facing a duplicate of the scene facing Tweedledee,
there is a major disturbance in the magnetic field just to Tweedledum's
left. This produces a jarring sensation in Tweedledum's left side. As a
consequence, Tweedledum does not share Tweedledee's feeling of symmetry.

Whether a picture is symmetric is a property of its internal features,
but it is also a feature that can be destroyed without changing the
internal features by just adding more material to one side. It is a
*totality* property of pictures, a property the picture has because it
stops just where it does.[^4] Similarly, totality qualia are qualia that
we have in part because we don't have any more feelings than we actually
do. Feelings of symmetry are totality qualia in this sense, as are many
of the feelings of calm and peacefulness associated with Tweedledee's
state. It is *not* intuitive that totality qualia should be intrinsic to
a region. Indeed, it seems intuitive that a duplicate of me that was
extended to produce *more* sensory features would lack these feelings.
Hence a duplicate of me would not share my conscious life in *all*
respects, so Hawthorne's premise (1) is also false. To be sure, these
totality qualia are a somewhat speculative suggestion, but the Humean
does not *need* them since Hawthorne's anti-Humean argument is invalid.

[^1]: This move requires the not wholly uncontroversial assumption that
    regions are the kinds of things that can have properties. But I'll
    happily make that assumption here. Note that the formulation here
    allows that the property denoted might be intrinsic for some *c* and
    *e* and extrinsic for others. I'll say causation is extrinsic if the
    property denoted is extrinsic for some choice of *c* and *e*, even
    if it is intrinsic for others, as it might be if, for example, no
    region could possess the property because *c* is a part of *e*.

[^2]: There is a potential complication here in that arguably in some
    such worlds, e.g. worlds where there is another planet on the
    opposite side of the sun to duplicate-earth where people are
    immediately 'resurrected' when the 'die' on duplicate-earth. In such
    a world you might say that duplicate-Lincoln doesn't really die on
    duplicate-Earth, but merely has the duplicate-earth part of his life
    ended. We'll understand 'dying' in such a way that this counts as
    dying.

[^3]: I assume here that events can be properly said to have locations.
    Spelling out this assumption in detail will require some serious
    metaphysics, particularly when it comes to omissions. Where exactly
    does my omission to stop the Iraq War take place? Here at my kitchen
    table where I am? In Iraq, where the war is? In Washington, if
    that's where I'd be were I doing something to stop the war? These
    questions are hard, though not so hard that we should give up on the
    very natural idea that events have locations.

[^4]: Ted @Sider2001 [@Sider2003] stresses the importance to a theory of
    intrinsicness of properties that are instantiated in virtue of the
    object *not* bearing relations to other objects. My example here is
    closely modeled on examples from his papers.
