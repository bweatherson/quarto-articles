*Relativism and Monadic Truth* is a sustained attack on 'analytical
relativism', as it has developed in recent years. The attack focusses on
two kinds of arguments. One is the argument from the behaviour of
operators, as developed by David @Lewis1980b and David @Kaplan1977-KAPD.
The other kind of argument takes off from phenomena concerning speech
reports and disagreements. Such arguments play central roles in
arguments by, among others, Andy @Egan2007-EGAEMR, Max
@Kolbel2009-KLBTEF, Peter @Lasersohn2005, John MacFarlane [-@MacFarlane2003-MACFCA;
-@MacFarlane2007-MACRAD], Mark @Richard2004-RICCAR and Tamina
@Stephenson2007-STEJDE. These arguments also play a role in a paper that
I co-authored with Andy Egan and John Hawthorne [@Egan2005-EGAEMI].

</aside>

As the reader of *Relativism and Monadic Truth* can tell, John Hawthorne
no longer much likes the arguments of that paper, nor its conclusions.
And I think he's right to be sceptical of some of the arguments we
advanced. The objections that he and Herman Cappelen raise to arguments
for relativism from speech reports and from disagreement are, I think,
telling. But I don't think those are the best arguments for relativism.
(For what it's worth, I don't think they're even the best arguments in
the paper we co-authored.) The primary purpose of this note will be say
a little about what some of these better arguments are. The core idea
will be that although there is some data that is *consistent* with
non-relativist theories, the best explanation of this data is that a
kind of relativism is true. In short, we should be looking for
inductive, not deductive, arguments for relativism. I'm going to fill in
some details of this argument, and say a little about how it seemed to
slip out of the main storyline of *Relativism and Monadic Truth*.

In Chapter 2 of *Relativism and Monadic Truth*, Cappelen and Hawthorne
attempt to develop diagnostics for when an utterance type $S$ has
invariant content. They note that some relativist arguments presuppose a
diagnostic based on speech reports. The idea behind the presupposed
diagnostic is that if we can invariably report an utterance of $S$ by
$A$ by saying *A said that S*, then $S$ is semantically invariant. And
they note that this diagnostic isn't particularly reliable.

What they aim to replace it with is a diagnostic based on agreement
reports. Cappelen and Hawthorne are more careful on the details than
I'll be, but the rough idea is easy enough to understand. The diagnostic
says that if whenever $A$ and $B$ utter $S$, we can report that by
saying *A and B agree that S*, and the basis for our saying this is that
they made those utterances, then $S$'s content is invariant. The idea
behind the test is that if there isn't a single proposition that $A$ and
$B$ endorse, then it would be odd to say that they agree.

I don't think the diagnostic is particularly plausible. The next couple
of paragraphs won't come as much of a surprise to the authors of
*Relativism and Monadic Truth*, since the ideas come from a talk Herman
Cappelen did at the Arch√© Summer School in July 2009. But they are
central enough to the story I'm telling that they are worth including
here. The core problem for this agreement based diagnostic is that
sometimes we can report parties as agreeing even though they don't agree
on the truth value of any proposition. So while (1) has a disambiguation
where it is true only if something like (2) is true, it also has a
disambiguation where it is true as long as something like (3) is true.

Given that sentences like (1) could mean something like (3), there is
little reason to think that agreement diagnostics will provide us clear
evidence of sameness of content. Indeed, Cappelen and Hawthorne should
hope that this diagnostic doesn't always work, because the diagnostic
seems to entail relativism about epistemic modals. Imagine that a
detective and a psychic are both investigating a murder. They both
conclude that their evidence entails that Tatort did it, and that their
evidence is consistent with Tatort being dead. They are, however,
ignorant of each other's evidence, and indeed of the fact that the other
is working on the investigation. Still, if each utters (4), it seems we
are in a position to endorse (5).

This will be very hard to explain on a contextualist theory of epistemic
modals, if we accept the agreement diagnostic. That's because there's no
proposition (other than the proposition that Tatort is guilty) that they
agree about. I think this is *some* evidence in favour of relativism,
but if the contextualist wanted to argue that we should understand (4)
the same way we understand (1) (on its 'distributive' disambiguation),
it would be hard to conclusively show they were wrong.

In any case, it is hard to see why we should expect there to be a
diagnostic of the kind Cappelen and Hawthorne are aiming for. Such
diagnostics are the exception, not the rule, in social sciences. There's
no simple diagnostic for whether a particular state is democratic or
not. (Is modern-day Afghanistan a democracy? What about modern-day
Alabama?) Nor is there a simple diagnostic for whether a particular rule
is a law. (Are internal revenue regulations laws?) But political science
and jurisprudence don't collapse in the absence of such diagnostics. Nor
should philosophical semantics collapse in the absence of a simple test
for context-sensitivity.

Indeed, the situation is political science and in jurisprudence is in
one sense worse than it is in semantics. We can state, admittedly in
theory-laden terms, what it is for the content of a sentence type to be
context-invariant or context-sensitive. It is much harder to state, even
in theory-laden terms, what it is for a state to be democratic, or for a
rule to be a law. The problem with thinking about the questions I asked
in the previous paragraph isn't that there's some hidden piece of
evidence we haven't yet uncovered. It's that the concepts do not have
clear application conditions, and the hard cases fall between the clear
instances and non-instances of the relevant property. In semantics we
have, to a first approximation, a mere epistemic challenge.

Even if the hunt for a diagnostic for context-sensitivity is bound to be
futile, as I think it is, that doesn't mean it is harmless. I think the
structure of Cappelen and Hawthorne's inquiry, which starts by looking
for a test and then goes on to apply it, pushes us towards the wrong
kind of argument. The effect of this structure is that we end up looking
for *deductive* arguments for or against relativism, and the absence of
deductive arguments for relativism is taken to be a big problem for the
relativist. But we should have been looking for *inductive* arguments.
The best case for relativism, I think, will be a kind of inference to
the best explanation. For instance, a relativist might try to clean up
this argument.

1.  Our best theory of mental content is that the contents of beliefs
    and desires do not satisfy Simplicity.[^1]

2.  The role of language is to express thoughts, so if the contents of
    belief and desire do not satisfy Simplicity, the contents of
    sentences and utterances probably don't either.

3.  Simplicity is false as a theory of linguistic content.

This argument clearly isn't valid. That's by design; it's meant to be an
abductive argument against Simplicity about linguistic content. And of
course both premises are controversial. There's one argument for premise
1 in @Lewis1979b, and another in @Perry1979-PERTPO. Both arguments are
controversial. Indeed Cappelen and Hawthore spend some time (pages 50 to
54) responding to the Lewisian arguments, though they spend less time on
Perry's arguments.

I'm not going to try to advance the debate here over whether premise 1
is true or not. I suspect the solution will turn on much bigger issues
than can be covered in a note of this length. And that's because I think
the judgment about whether premise 1 is true will turn on quite global
features of our best theory of mental content. For instance, Daniel
@Nolan2006-NOLSD argues that there are certain desires that we cannot
understand on the modal Lewis offers. That doesn't *entail* that Lewis
is wrong about the nature of belief, but it does make Lewis's theory of
belief look less attractive. From the other direction, many authors
working on the Sleeping Beauty problem, dating back to the problem's
introduction to the philosophical community in @Elga2000-ELGSBA, have
felt that the problem was best approached in Lewis's
Simplicity-unfriendly framework. That doesn't entail Simplicity is
wrong, but it is I think evidence against it. On the other hand, Robert
@Stalnaker2008-STAOKO has recently argued that this is not the best
framework for thinking about the Sleeping Beauty problem, and I've
argued [@Weatherson-SoSB] that Stalnaker's approach lets us see things
about the Sleeping Beauty puzzle that are hidden on the standard,
Lewisian, approach. So if we're going to evaluate this kind of argument
for relativism, the issues are going to get far removed from familiar
disputes about distributions of words and phrases. That's not too
surprising. In general, the hard thing about abductive reasoning in
philosophy is that we have to start looking at all sorts of different
kinds of evidence. But that's no reason to think that the most telling
arguments won't, at the end of the day, be abductive arguments.

A quite different kind of argument comes from thinking about property
ascription and ignorance. It's a somewhat frequent occurrence that
modern science discovers that some of our thoughts seem to depend for
their truth on more variables than we realised. So it isn't true that
two accelerating objects simply have the same mass or different masses;
rather, their relative mass might be different relative to different
inertial frames. Or two colour patches might not be simply the same
colour or simply different colours. If the colours are metamers
(relative to human vision) then they will be in a good sense the same
colour relative to human vision, and different colours relative to more
discriminating detectors. Such cases raise challenges for the project of
interpreting a language.

Assume that the community uses terms like 'mass'. Indeed, assume they
are sophisticated enough to distinguish mass from weight, for they know
that weight is relative to a gravitational field, and gravitational
fields vary in strength. But they are not sophisticated enough to know
that masses are relative to inertial frames. The members of this
community frequently go around saying things like "Those two objects
have the same mass," referring to $a$ and $b$. Call that sentence $M$.
We assume that the members are in a particular inertial frame, call it
$F$. Let's assume (just for a few paragraphs) that the propositions that
satisfy Simplicity are structured, and assume that we can represent the
relation *has the same mass as* by a somewhat unstructured relation
$SameMass$. (In other words, ignore whatever internal structure
$SameMass$ has, since it won't be relevant to this example.) Then it
seems to me that there are three live options around.

1.  By $M$, the speakers express the pseudo-proposition
    $SameMass(a, b)$, and this pseudo-proposition is not capable of
    being true or false, since $SameMass$ is a three-place relation
    (between two objects and an inertial frame) and only two places are
    specified.

2.  By $M$, the speakers express the proposition $SameMass(a, b, F)$,
    and this proposition is (capable of being) true.

3.  By $M$, the speakers express the proposition $SameMass(a, b)$, and
    this is (capable of being) true relative to $F$, although it might
    be false relative to some other inertial frame $F^{\prime}$.

If option 3 is correct, then it seems Simplicity fails.[^2] So if there
are compelling arguments against options 1 and 2, and those are all the
options, then Simplicity is in trouble. And it seems the relativist
might make progress by pushing back against both of those options.

The simplest argument against option 1 is that it violates even a very
weak form of the Principle of Charity. Obviously there are very many
different kinds of charity principles. For instance, there are three
different versions endorsed in @Davidson1970-DAVME, @Lewis1974c and
[@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 Ch. 8]. But any kind of Charity will imply
that options 2 or 3 are preferable to option 1, since option 1 will
imply that the subjects don't even have beliefs about the relative
masses of objects, whereas the other options will imply that their
beliefs may well be true, and rational, and even in some cases amount to
knowledge. An alternative argument against option 1 is that the members
of that community would have been right to take it as a Moorean fact
that some things have the same mass.[^3] So option 1 doesn't look overly
plausible.

One argument against premise 2 is that it is impossible for the members
of the community, given their powers of individuation, to make singular
reference to such a thing as an inertial frame. If they don't know what
an inertial frame is, then we might be sceptical of claims that they can
refer to it. (Note that the thought here isn't merely that some
individuals don't know what inertial frames are; the imagined case is
that even experts don't know about the kind of things that we would need
to put into the propositions to give them simple truth values.) Another
argument is that competent speakers of the language should be able to
identify the number of argument places in the properties they use.

Neither of the arguments just offered is completely compelling, though I
think both are at least promising avenues for research. But both
arguments do look notably weaker if we drop the assumption that the
relevant propositions are structured. In an unstructured propositions
framework, we perhaps don't need to worry about the members making
singular reference to things like inertial frames. We just need to have
the speakers pick out (in a perhaps imperfect way) the worlds in which
their beliefs are true. And in an unstructured propositions framework it
isn't clear that being unable to identify the number of arguments places
in the properties they use is any more of a sign of linguistic
incompetence than not knowing the individuals to which they refer. But
it is a commonplace of semantic externalism that speakers can refer
without knowing who it is they are referring to.

The arguments in the previous two paragraphs have been sketchy, to say
the least. But if they can be developed into compelling arguments, then
it might turn out that the case against option 2 succeeds iff
propositions are structured. In that case the argument for Simplicity
will turn on a very large question about the nature of propositions,
namely whether they are structured or not. Again, the take home lesson
is that debates in this area are not susceptible to easy resolution.

I'll end with a more narrowly linguistic abductive argument for
relativism and against Simplicity. I think you can find the core
ingredients of this argument in @Egan2005-EGAEMI, though it isn't as
well individuated as it might have been. The argument takes off from
what looks like a somewhat misleading claim in Cappelen and Hawthorne's
book. The context is a discussion of autocentric and exocentric uses of
predicates.[^4] The distinction between autocentric and exocentric uses
is important for thinking about the way various predicates are used,
though it isn't easy to give a theory-neutral characterisation of it.
Assuming contextualism, Cappelen and Hawthorne note that it is easy to
explain the distinction: "a use of a taste predicate is autocentric iff
its truth conditions are given by a completion that indexes the
predicate to the subject" and exocentric iff "its truth conditions are
given by a completion that indexes it to a person or group other than
the speaker, which may, however, include the speaker." (104) The core
idea here is clear enough, I hope, though as they say it requires a
slightly different gloss if we assume relativism.[^5]

The problem is what they go on to say about epistemic modals. In a
footnote they say,

> [I]t is worth noting that there is a similar contrast between
> autocentric and exocentric uses of epistemic modals. If I see Sally
> hiding on a bus then I might in a suitable context say 'She is hiding
> because I might be on the bus' even though I know perfectly well that

> we shall not undertake to explain this here.) (104n7)

The parenthetical remark seems mistaken, or at least misleading, and for
an important reason. It is true that it is very hard to use 'must'
exocentrically in a sentence of the form *a must be F*. But that doesn't
mean that it is hard to use 'must' exocentically. In fact it's very
easy. Almost any sentence of the form *S believes that a must be F* will
have an exocentric use of 'must'. That's because almost any use of an
epistemic modal in the scope of a propositional attitude report will be
'bound' to the subject of that report. (I put 'bound' in scare quotes
because although contextualists will think of this as literally a case
of binding, non-contextualists may think something else is going on.)
This suggests an argument for relativism about epistemic modals, one
that seems to me to be quite a bit stronger than the arguments for
relativism discussed in *Relativism and Monadic Truth*.

1.  Unembedded uses of epistemic modals are generally autocentric
    (except in the context of explanations, like 'because I might be on
    the bus').

2.  Epistemic modals embedded in propositional attitude reports are
    generally exocentric.

3.  There is a good, simple relativist explanation of these two facts.

4.  There is no good, simple explanation of these facts consistent with
    Simplicity.

5.  So, relativism is true, and Simplicity is false.

Note that I'm not for a minute suggesting that there is no
Simplicity-friendly explanation of the facts to be had; just that it
won't be a very good explanation. Nor am I suggesting that the phenomena
obtain universally, rather than just in most cases. But they obtain
often enough to need explanation, and the best explanation will be
relativist. And that, I think, is a reason to like relativism.

The simplest relativist explanation of premises 1 and 2 uses the idea,
derived from @Lewis1979b, that contents are $\lambda$-abstracts. So the
content of *a must be F* is roughly $\lambda x.(x$'s evidence entails
that $a$ is $F).$ A content $\lambda x. \phi(x)$ is true relative to a
person iff they are $\phi$, and believed by a person iff they consider
themselves to be $\phi$, under a distinctively first-personal mode of
presentation. Then a typical utterance of *a must be F* will be
autocentric because if the asserter thinks it is true, they must take
themselves to satisfy $\lambda x.(x$'s evidence entails that $a$ is
$F).$ So assuming they are speaking truly, the hearer can infer that the
speaker's evidence does indeed entail that $a$ is $F$. But a typical
utterance of *S believes that a must be F* will be true just in case $S$
takes themselves to satisfy $\lambda x.(x$'s evidence entails that $a$
is $F)$, and hence will be true as long as $S$'s evidence, or at least
what $S$ takes to be their evidence, entails that $a$ is $F$. There's no
reference there to the speaker's evidence, so the use of 'must' is
exocentric. There are, to be sure, many details of this explanation that
could use filling in, but what is clear is that there is a natural path
from the view that contents are $\lambda$-abstracts to the data to be
explained. And that explanation is inconsistent with Simplicity.

Is there a good, simple Simplicity-friendly explanation of the data
around? I suspect there is not. There are two obvious places to look for
a Simplicity-friendly explanation. We could look for an explanation that
turns on the meaning of 'must', or we could look for an explanation in
terms of salience. On closer inspection, neither avenue is particularly
promising.

It does seem likely that there is an available explanation of premise 1
in terms of the meaning of 'must'. The contextualist about pronouns has
an easy explanation of why 'we' almost always picks out a group that
includes the speaker. The explanation is just that it is part of the
meaning of 'we' that it is a *first-personal* plural pronoun, so it is
part of the meaning of 'we' that the group it picks out includes the
speaker. We could argue that something similar goes on for 'must'. So *a
must be F* means, roughly, that $x$'s evidence entails that $a$ is $F$,
and it is part of the meaning of 'must' that $x$ either is the speaker,
or is a group that includes the speaker. The problem with this
explanation is that it won't extend to premise 2. And that's because
meanings (in the relevant sense) don't change when we move into embedded
contexts. For example if Jones says "Smith thinks that we will all get
worse grades than she will get", Jones isn't accusing Smith of having
the inconsistent belief that she will get lower grades than what she
gets. Rather, the reference of 'we' is still a group that includes the
*speaker*, not the subject of the propositional attitude report. On this
model, you'd expect the truth condition of *S believes that a must be F*
to be that $S$ believes that $x$'s evidence entails that $a$ is $F$,
where $x$ is the speaker, or a group containing the speaker. But that's
typically not at all what it means. So this kind of explanation fails.

The problem for salience based explanations of premises 1 and 2 is that
salience is too fragile an explanatory base to explain the data. Let's
say that in general we think *a must be F* means, roughly, that $x$'s
evidence entails that $a$ is $F$, and $x$ is generally the most salient
knower in the context. Then we'd expect that it would be not too hard to
read (6) in such a way that its truth condition is (6a) rather than
(6b), and (7) in such a way that its truth condition is (7a) rather than
(7b).

After all, (6) and (7) make Jones's evidence *really salient*. That
evidence settles who the killer is! But, it seems, that isn't salient
enough to make (6a) or (7a) the preferred interpretation. That seems to
be bad news for a salience-based explanation of the way we interpret
epistemic modals.

Like all abductive arguments, this argument is far from conclusive. One
way for a proponent of Simplicity to respond to it would be to come up
with a neater explanation of premises 1 and 2 in our abductive argument,
without giving up Simplicity. Another way would be to argue that
although there is no nice Simplicity-friendly explanation of the data,
the costs of relativism are so high that we should shun the relativist
explanation on independent grounds. I don't pretend to have ready
responses to either of these moves. All I want to stress is that these
abductive arguments are generally stronger arguments for relativism than
the arguments that are, correctly, dismissed in *Relativism and Monadic
Truth*. Those arguments try to take a quick path to relativism, claiming
that some data about reports, or disagreement, or syntax, entails
relativism. I doubt any such argument works, in part because of the
objections that Cappelen and Hawthorne raise. There is, as my title
says, no royal road to relativism. But I doubt there's a quick road away
from relativism either. If the relativist can explain with ease patterns
that perplex the contextualist, we have good reason to believe that
relativism is in fact true.

[^1]: *Simplicity* is Cappelen and Hawthorne's name for the conjunction
    of theses they want to defend against the relativist. For our
    purposes, Simplicity about mental content is the view that the
    contents of beliefs and desires are propositions, and these
    propositions are simply true or simply false, not merely true or
    false relative to some or other parameter. Simplicity about
    linguistic content is the view that these same propositions, the
    ones that are simply true or false, are the contents of declarative
    utterances.

[^2]: I say 'seems' since I'm not sure exactly what it takes for there
    to be a notion of truth *simpliciter*. The argument on page 96
    against the conjunction of Simplicity, Eternalism and Temporalism
    suggests that Cappelen and Hawthorne believe the following
    principle: If $p$ is true in $C_1$, and false in $C_2$, and $C_1$
    and $C_2$ both exist, then $p$ is not either simply true or simply
    false. It's not obvious to me why $p$ couldn't, in $C_1$, be simply
    true, but I take it Cappelen and Hawthorne are using 'simply' in
    such a way as to exclude that. So option 3 is inconsistent with
    Simplicity.

[^3]: Compare the discussion of Moorean facts in [@Lewis1994a 489].

[^4]: The terminology is from @Lasersohn2005.

[^5]: As they also go on to note, things get very complicated in cases
    where the truth conditions turn on the nature of an idealised
    version of the speaker. An example of such a theory is the theory of
    value in @Lewis1989b. One of the key points that Cappelen and
    Hawthorne make, and I think it is a very good point against a lot of
    claims for relativist theories concerning predicates of personal
    taste, is that this kind of case is very common when it comes to
    evaluative language.
