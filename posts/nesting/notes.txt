# Nesting and the Value of Information

Experimental setup
 - <W, E1, E2, ... En>
 - Not de se - the W are 'small worlds'
 - Start with a (countably additive) distribution over W, and update by conditionalisation on Ek(w), where k is the experiment that's run, and w is the actual world.

Short history of VoI
 - Pierce
 - Blackwell at length
 - Good as special case
 
Non-Partitional Theories
 - Williamson against transitivity, result just reflexivity
 - Stalnaker on S4.2
 - Gean(sic) and Dorst on nesting
 
Nesting isn't closed under conjunction
 - Trivial example
 - W = R*R, E1(a, b) = {x,y: x>=a}, E2(a, b) = {x,y: y>=b}

Is S4.2 closed under conjunction?
 - Have to ask computer
