John Hawthorne and Jason Stanley [-@Hawthorne2008-HAWKAA], defend what
they call the "Reason-Knowledge Principle".

There have been many attempts in the literature to show that this leads
to implausible *actions*. As Jonathan @Ichikawa2012 shows, most of these
attempts rest on further, and arguably false, assumptions about the
connection between reasons and action. Relatedly, most of those
responses concern the role of knowledge and reasons in decision-making.
I'll argue that we can formulate a sharper problem for the principle if
we focus on game-playing, and say exactly which extra assumptions we are
making.

The Reason-Knowledge Principle should have the following implications,
at least for cases where $S$'s aim is to produce the best outcome.

1.  If $S$ knows that $\varphi$ and $\psi$ will produce the same
    outcome, and $S$ must choose $\varphi$ or $\psi$, then it is
    rationally permissible for $S$ to choose $\psi$.

2.  If $S$ knows that $\varphi$ and $\psi$ will produce the same outcome
    if $p$, and $\varphi$ will produce a better outcome if $\neg p$,
    then it is rationally permissible for $S$ to choose $\psi$ iff she
    knows $p$.

The point of (1) is that $S$ can use her knowledge that $\varphi$ and
$\psi$ will produce the same outcome to justify making an arbitrary
choice between $\varphi$ and $\psi$. And the point of (2) is that the
Reason-Knowledge Principle suggests only knowledge that $p$ could
justify ignoring the fact that $\psi$ does worse than $\varphi$ if
$\neg p$.

Define a **symmetric** game as having these features:

-   The game is purely co-operative; each player gets the same payoffs;

-   Each player knows nothing about the other save that it is common
    knowledge the players are rational, and hence know what each other's
    rational requirements are;

-   Each player has the same moves available; and,

-   The payoffs are a function of just which moves are made, not of who
    makes them.

Assume $A$ and $B$ are playing a symmetric game, and it is common
knowledge which symmetric game they are playing. Then the following
premise seems hard to dispute:

3.  It is rationally required for $A$ to play $\varphi$ iff $A$ knows
    $B$ will play $\varphi$.

What makes (3) so compelling is that we can derive it from (4), (5) and
(6).

4.  $A$ knows that $B$ will play $\varphi$ iff $A$ knows that any
    rational player will play $\varphi$.

5.  If $A$ knows any rational player will play $\varphi$, then $A$ is
    rationally required to play $\varphi$.

6.  If $A$ is rationally required to play $\varphi$, then $A$ knows that
    any rational player will play $\varphi$.

We get (4) from the fact that $A$ knows nothing about $B$ save that she
is rational. We get (5) by the factivity of knowledge. And we get (6) by
the requirement that the players are rational, and hence know what
rationality requires of each player. And these three together entail
(3). So (3) is true, and (1) and (2) are entailed by the
Reason-Knowledge Principle. Unfortunately, (1), (2) and (3) are
inconsistent, as we'll now show.

Informally, in this game $A$ and $B$ must each play either a green or
red card. I will capitalise $A$'s moves, i.e., $A$ can play GREEN or
RED, and italicise $B$'s moves, i.e., $B$ can play *green* or *red*. If
two green cards, or one green card and one red card are played, each
player gets \$1. If two red cards are played, each gets nothing. Each
cares just about their own wealth, so getting \$1 is worth 1 util. All
of this is common knowledge. More formally, here is the game table, with
$A$ on the row and $B$ on the column.

::: {.center}
  ------- --------- -------
           *green*   *red*
    GREEN   1, 1     1, 1
      RED   1, 1     0, 0
  ------- --------- -------
:::

Assume $A$ knows $B$ will play *green*. By (3), it is rationally
required that $A$ plays GREEN. But $A$ can use this knowledge of $B$ to
deduce that GREEN and RED have the same payoff. So by (1), it is
rationally permissible to play RED. Contradiction.

Now assume $A$ does not know $B$ will play *green*. By (3), it is not a
rational requirement that $A$ plays GREEN. But $A$ knows that GREEN does
better than RED unless $B$ plays *green*. And since she doesn't know $B$
plays *green*, by (2), she's required to play GREEN. Contradiction.

So either assuming that $A$ does or does not know that it is rationally
required for $B$ to play *green* leads to a contradiction given (1), (2)
and (3). So these three premises are inconsistent. Since (3) is true,
that means (1) or (2) is false. And since the Reason-Knowledge principle
entails those two premises, one of which is false, the Reason-Knowledge
Principle is false.

I'm not entirely sure which of (1) and (2) is false; both of them do
feel plausible. I suspect the problem is (1). Assume $A$ deduces from
premises she believes that rational players will play a green card.
Perhaps she agrees with Robert @Stalnaker1998 that rationality requires
avoiding weakly dominated options. Then she knows it doesn't matter to
her outcome whether she plays GREEN or RED; she will get \$1 either way.
But if she plays RED, she is incoherent; she is doing something she
thinks no rational player does. And perhaps this incoherence is a bad
thing in itself. Niko @Kolodny2005 argues that incoherence is not bad in
itself; Jacob @Ross2012 argues that it is. The suggestion that (1) is
the false premise favours Ross's view over Kolodny's. But this
conclusion is very speculative; the main thing I wanted to note was the
problem this game raises for the Reason-Knowledge Principle.
