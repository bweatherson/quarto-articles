title: "The Bayesian and the Dogmatist"
description: |
 It has been argued recently that dogmatism in epistemology is incompatible with Bayesianism. That is, it has been argued that dogmatism cannot be modelled using traditional techniques for Bayesian modelling. I argue that our response to this should not be to throw out dogmatism, but to develop better modelling techniques. I sketch a model for formal learning in which an agent can discover a posteriori fundamental epistemic connections. In this model, there is no formal objection to dogmatism.

There is a lot of philosophically interesting work being done in the
borderlands between traditional and formal epistemology. It is easy to
think that this would all be one-way traffic. When we try to formalise a
traditional theory, we see that its hidden assumptions are inconsistent
or otherwise untenable. Or we see that the proponents of the theory had
been conflating two concepts that careful formal work lets us
distinguish. Either way, the formalist teaches the traditionalist a
lesson about what the live epistemological options are. I want to argue,
more or less by example, that the traffic here should be two-way. By
thinking carefully about considerations that move traditional
epistemologists, we can find grounds for questioning some
presuppositions that many formal epistemologists make.

</aside>

To make this more concrete, I'm going to be looking at a Bayesian
objection to a certain kind of dogmatism about justification. Several
writers have urged that the incompatibility of dogmatism with a kind of
Bayesianism is a reason to reject dogmatism. I rather think that it is
reason to question the Bayesianism. To put the point slightly more
carefully, there is a simple proof that dogmatism (of the kind I
envisage) can't be modelled using standard Bayesian modelling tools.
Rather than conclude that dogmatism is therefore flawed, I conclude that
we need better modelling tools. I'll spend a fair bit of this paper on
outlining a kind of model that (a) allows us to model dogmatic
reasoning, (b) is motivated by the epistemological considerations that
motivate dogmatism, and (c) helps with a familiar problem besetting the
Bayesian.

I'm going to work up to that problem somewhat indirectly. I'll start
with looking at the kind of sceptical argument that motivates dogmatism.
I'll then briefly rehearse the argument that shows dogmatism and
Bayesianism are incompatible. Then in the bulk of the paper I'll suggest
a way of making Bayesian models more flexible so they are no longer
incompatible with dogmatism. I'll call these new models *dynamic
Keynesian* models of uncertainty. I'll end with a brief guide to the
virtues of my new kind of model.

## Sceptical Arguments

Let *H* be some relatively speculative piece of knowledge that we have,
say that G. E. Moore had hands, or that it will snow in Alaska sometime
next year. And let *E* be all of our evidence about the external world.
I'm not going to make many assumptions about what *E* contains, but for
now *E* will stay fairly schematic. Now a fairly standard sceptical
argument goes something like this. Consider a situation *S* in which our
evidence is unchanged, but in which *H* is false, such as a brain-in-vat
scenario, or a zombie scenario, or a scenario where the future does not
resemble the past. Now a fairly standard sceptical argument goes
something like this.

1.  To know *H* we have to be in a position to know we aren't in *S*

2.  We aren't in a position to know that we aren't in *S*

3.  So, we don't know *H*

There are a few immediate responses one could make, but which I'm going
to dismiss without argument *here*. These include claiming the setup is
incoherent (as in, e.g., @Williamson2000-WILKAI), rejecting the closure
principle behind premise 1 (as in, e.g., @Dretske1971, accepting the
conclusion (the sceptical response), or saying that in different
sceptical arguments, one or other of these positions is correct. Instead
I want to look at responses that question premise 2. In particular, I
want to look at responses that offer us reasons to accept premise 2,
since it seems here that the sceptic is at her strongest. (If the
sceptic merely insists that premise 2 is reasonable, we can reply either
that it isn't, as I'm inclined to think, or that here is a case where
intuition should be revised.)

Many epistemologists will write papers responding to 'the sceptic'. I
think this is a mistake, since there are so many different possible
sceptics, each with different arguments for premise 2. (And, of course,
some sceptics do not argue from sceptical scenarios like this one.) Here
are, for instance, three arguments that sceptics might give for premise
2.

1.  Someone in *S* can't discriminate her situation from yours.

2.  Indiscriminability is symmetric.

3.  If you can't discriminate our situation from *S*, you can't know
    you're not in *S*.

4.  So you can't know you're not in *S*.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Someone in *S* has the same evidence as you do.

2.  What you can know supervenes on what your evidence is.

3.  So, you can't know you are not in *S*.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  There is no non-circular argument to the conclusion that you aren't
    in *S*.

2.  If you were able to know you're not in *S*, you would be able to
    produce a non-circular argument that concluded that you aren't in
    *S*.

3.  So you can't know that you aren't in *S*.

I won't say much about these arguments, save that I think in each case
the second premise is very implausible. I suspect that most
non-philosophers who are moved by sceptical arguments are tacitly
relying on one or other of these arguments, but confirming that would
require a more careful psychological study than I could do. But set
those aside, because there's a fourth argument that is more troubling.
This argument takes its inspiration from what we might call Hume's
exhaustive argument for inductive scepticism. Hume said that we can't
justify induction inductively, and we can't justify it deductively, and
that *exhausts* the justifications, so we can't justify induction. A
similar kind of argument helps out the general sceptic.

1.  If you know you aren't in *S*, you know this a priori, or a
    posteriori

2.  You can't know you aren't in *S* a posteriori

3.  You can't know you aren't in *S* a priori

4.  So, you can't know you aren't in *S*

This seems to be a really interesting argument to me. To make things
simpler, I'll stipulate that by a posteriori knowledge, I just mean
knowledge that isn't a priori. That makes the first premise pretty
secure, as long as we're assuming classical logic.[^1] Lots of
philosophers take its third premise for granted. They assume that since
it is metaphysically possible that you could be in *S*, this can't be
something you can rule out a priori. That strikes me as a rather odd
capitulation to infallibilism. But I won't push that here. Instead I'll
look at denials of the second premise.

## Dogmatism and a Bayesian Objection

Someone who denies the second premise says that your empirical evidence
can provide the basis for knowing that you aren't in *S*, even though
you didn't know this a priori. I'm going to call such a person a
*dogmatist*, for reasons that will become clear shortly. The dogmatist
is not a sceptic, so the dogmatist believes that you can know *H*. The
dogmatist also believes a closure principle, so the dogmatist also
believes you can know *E* ${\supset}$ *H*. If the dogmatist thought you
could know *E* ${\supset}$ *H* a priori, they'd think that you could
know a priori that you weren't in *S*. (This follows by another
application of closure.) But they think that isn't possible, so knowing
*E* ${\supset}$ *H* a priori isn't possible. Hence you know
*E* ${\supset}$ *H* a posteriori.

If we reflect on the fact that *E* is your total evidence, then we can
draw two conclusions. The first is that the dogmatist thinks that you
can come to know *H* on the basis of *E* even though you didn't know in
advance that if *E* is true, then *H* is true. You don't, that is, need
*antecedent* knowledge of the conditional in order to be able to learn
*H* from *E*. That's why I'm calling them a dogmatist. The second point
is that the dogmatist is now running head on into a piece of Bayesian
orthodoxy.

To see the problem, note that we can easily prove (A), for arbitrary
*E*, *H* and *K*.[^2]

\(A\)

It is clear enough from the proof that line 6 is an equality iff line 3
is an equality, so we have proven (A). Now some authors have inferred
from this something like (B) from (A).[^3]

\(B\)

:   It is impossible to go from not being in a position to know
    *E* ${\supset}$ *H* to being in a position to know it just by
    receiving evidence *E*.

The transition here should raise an eyebrow or two. (A) is a principle
of probability statics. (B) is a principle of epistemological
kinematics. To get from (A) to (B) we need a principle linking
probability and epistemology, and a principle linking statics and
kinematics. Fortunately, orthodox Bayesian confirmation theory offers us
suggestions for both principles. We'll write *Cr*(*A*) for the agent's
credence in *A*, and *Cr~E~*(*A*) for the agent's credence in *A* when
updated by receiving evidence *E*.

[Learning]{.smallcaps}:

:   If *Cr~E~*(*A*) ${\leq}$ *Cr*(*A*), then it is impossible to go from
    not being in a position to know *A* to being in a position to know
    it just by receiving evidence *E*.

[Bayes]{.smallcaps}:

:   *Cr~E~*(*A*) = *Cr*(*A*  *E*). That is, learning goes by
    conditionalisation.

A quick browse at any of the literature on Bayesian confirmation theory
will show that these principles are both widely accepted by Bayesians.
Philosophers, even Bayesians, make false assumptions, so neither of
these principles is obviously true. Nevertheless, I'm going to accept
[Learning]{.smallcaps} at least for the sake of argument. I'm going to
argue instead that the inference from (A) to (B) fails because
[Bayes]{.smallcaps} fails. That is, I'm going to accept that if we could
prove a principle I'll call [Lower]{.smallcaps} is true, then dogmatism
in the sense I'm defending it fails.

[Lower]{.smallcaps}.

:   *Cr~E~*(*E* ${\supset}$ *H*) is less than or equal to
    *Cr*(*E* ${\supset}$ *H*).

Now there is a bad argument around here that the dogmatist might make.
It might be argued that since the Bayesian approach (including
[Bayes]{.smallcaps}) involves so much idealisation it could not be
applicable to real agents. That's a bad argument because the Bayesian
approach might provide us with a good model for real agents, and models
can be useful without being scale models. As long as the Bayesian model
is the most appropriate model in the circumstances, then we can draw
conclusions for the real world from facts about the model. The problem
arises if there are alternative models which seem to fit just as well,
but in which principles like [Lower]{.smallcaps} are not true. If there
are alternative models that seem better suited (or at least just as well
suited) to modelling the situation of initial evidence acquisition, and
those models do not make [Lower]{.smallcaps} true, then we might think
the derivation of [Lower]{.smallcaps} in the Bayesian model is a mere
consequence of the arbitrary choice of model. In the next section I will
develop just such a model. I won't argue that it is the best model, let
alone the only alternative to the Bayesian model. But I will argue that
it is as good for these purposes as the Bayesian model, and it does not
imply [Lower]{.smallcaps}.

## Bayes and Keynes

The traditional Bayesian model of a rational agent starts with the
following two principles.

-   At any moment, the agent's credal states are represented by a
    probability function.

-   From moment to moment, the agent's credal states are updated by
    conditionalisation on the evidence received.

Over recent decades many philosophers have been interested in models
that relax those assumptions. One particular model that has got a lot of
attention (from e.g. Isaac @Levi1974 [@Levi1980], Richard @Jeffrey1983,
Bas @vanFraassen1990, Alan @Hajek2000 [@Hajek2003] and many others) is
what I'll call the *static Keynesian model*. This model has the
following features.

-   At any moment, the agent's credal states are represented by a set of
    probability functions, called their representor.

-   The agent holds that *p* is more probable than *q* iff the
    probability of *p* is greater than the probability of *q* according
    to all probability functions in their representor. The agent holds
    that *p* and *q* are equally probable iff the probability of *p* is
    equal to the probability of *q* according to all probability
    functions in their representor.

-   From moment to moment, the agent's credal states are updated by
    conditionalising each of the functions in the representor on the
    evidence received.

The second point is the big attraction. It allows that the agent need
not hold that *p* is more probable than *q*, or *q* more probable than
*p*, or that *p* and *q* are equally probable, for arbitrary *p* and
*q*. And that's good because it isn't a rationality requirement that
agents make pairwise probability judgments about all pairs of
propositions. Largely because of this feature, I argued in an earlier
paper that this model could be use to formalise the key philosophical
ideas in Keynes's *Treatise on Probability*. That's the reason I call
this a 'Keynesian' model.

The modifier 'static' might seem a little strange, because the agent's
representor does change when she receives new evidence. But the change
is always of a certain kind. Her 'hypothetical priors' do not change. If
at *t*~1~ her evidence is *E*~1~ and her representor *R*~1~, and at
*t*~2~ her evidence is *E*~2~ and her representor *R*~2~, then there is
a 'prior' representor *R*~0~ such that the following two claims are true
for all probability functions *Pr*.

-   *Pr* ${\in}$ *R*~1~ ${\leftrightarrow}$ [${\exists}$Pr~0~ ${\in}$
    *R*~0~: ${\forall}$*p* (*Pr*(*p*) = Pr~0~(*p* *E*~1~)]

-   *Pr* ${\in}$ *R*~2~ ${\leftrightarrow}$ [${\exists}$Pr~0~ ${\in}$
    *R*~0~: ${\forall}$*p* (*Pr*(*p*) = Pr~0~(*p* *E*~2~)]

That is, there is a set of probability functions such that the agent's
representor at any time is the result of conditionalising each of those
functions on her evidence. I'll call any model with this property a
static model, so the model described above is the static Keynesian
model.

Now there is a lot to like about the static Keynesian model, and I have
made extensive use of it previous work. It is a particularly useful
model to use when we need to distinguish between risk and uncertainty in
the sense that these terms are used in Keynes's 1937 article "The
General Theory of Employment".[^4] The traditional Bayesian model
assumes that all propositions are risky, but in real life some
propositions are uncertain as well, and in positions of radical doubt,
where we have little or no empirical evidence, presumably most
propositions are extremely uncertain. And using the static Keynesian
model does not mean we have to abandon the great work done in Bayesian
epistemology and philosophy of science. Since a Bayesian model is a
(degenerate) static Keynesian model, we can say that in many
circumstances (namely circumstances where *uncertainty* can be properly
ignored) the Bayesian model will be appropriate. Indeed, these days it
is something like a consensus among probabilists or Bayesians that the
static Keynesian model is a useful generalisation of the Bayesian model.
For example in @Christensen2005 it is noted, almost as an afterthought,
that the static Keynesian model will be more realistic, and hence
potentially more useful, than the traditional Bayesian model.
Christensen doesn't appear to take this as any kind of *objection* to
Bayesianism, and I think this is just the right attitude.

But just as the static Keynesian is more general than the Bayesian
model, there are bound to be interesting models that are more general
than the static Keynesian model. One such model is what I call the
*dynamic* Keynesian model. This model has been used by Seth Yalcin to
explicate some interesting semantic theories, but to the best of my
knowledge it has not been used for epistemological purposes before. That
should change. The model is like the static Keynesian model in its use
of representors, but it changes the way updating is modelled. When an
agent with representor *R* receives evidence *E*, she should update her
representor by a two step process.

-   Replace *R* with U(*R*, *E*)

-   Conditionalise U(*R*, *E*), i.e. replace it with {*Pr*( *E*): *Pr*
    is in U(*R*, *E*)}

In this story, U is a function that takes two inputs: a representor and
a piece of evidence, and returns a representor that is a subset of the
original representor. Intuitively, this models the effect of learning,
via getting evidence *E*, what evidential relationships obtain. In the
static Keynesian model, it is assumed that before the agent receives
evidence *E*, she could already say which propositions would receive
probabilistic support from *E*. All of the relations of evidential
support were encoded in her conditional probabilities. There is no place
in the model for learning about fundamental evidential relationships. In
the dynamic Keynesian model, this is possible. When the agent receives
evidence *E*, she might learn that certain functions that were
previously in her representor misrepresented the relationship between
evidence and hypotheses, particularly between evidence *E* and other
hypotheses. In those cases, U(*R*, *E*) will be her old representor *R*,
minus the functions that *E* teaches her misrepresent these evidential
relationships.

The dynamic Keynesian model seems well suited to the dogmatist, indeed
to any epistemological theory that allows for fundamental evidential
relationships to be only knowable a posteriori. As we'll see below, this
is a reason to stop here in the presentation of the model and not try
and say something systematic about the behaviour of U. Instead of
developing the model by saying more about *U*, we should assess it,
which is what I'll do next.

## In Defence of Dynamism

In this section I want go over three benefits of the dynamic Keynesian
model, and then say a little about how it relates to the discussion of
scepticism with which we opened. I'm not going to say much about
possible objections to the use of the model. That's partially for space
reasons, partially because what I have to say about the objections I
know of is fairly predictable, and partially because the model is new
enough that I don't really know what the strongest objections might be.
So here we'll stick to arguments for the view.

### The Dogmatist and the Keynesian

The first advantage of the dynamic Keynesian model is that because it
does not verify [Lower]{.smallcaps}, it is consistent with dogmatism.
Now if you think that dogmatism is obviously false, you won't think this
is much of an advantage. But I tend to think that dogmatism is one of
the small number of not absurd solutions to a very hard epistemological
problem with no obvious solution, so we should not rule it out
pre-emptively. Hence I think our formal models should be consistent with
it. What is tricky is proving that the dynamic Keynesian model is indeed
consistent with it.

To see whether this is true on the dynamic Keynesian model, we need to
say what it is to *lower* the credence of some proposition. Since
representors map propositions onto intervals rather than numbers, we
can't simply talk about one 'probability' being a smaller number than
another.[^5] On the static Keynesian model, the most natural move is to
say that conditionalisation on *E* *lowers* the credence of *p* iff for
all *Pr* in the representor, *Pr*(*p*) \> *Pr*(*p*  *E*). This implies
that if every function in the representor says that *E* is negatively
relevant to *p*, then conditionalising on *E* makes *p* less probable.
Importantly, it allows this even if the values that *Pr*(*p*) takes
across the representor before and after conditionalisation overlap. So
what should we say on the dynamic Keynesian model? The weakest approach
that seems viable, and not coincidentally the most plausible approach,
is to say that updating on *E* lowers the credence of *p* iff the
following conditions are met:

-   For all *Pr* in U(*R*, *E*), *Pr*(*p* *E*) \< *Pr*(*p*)

-   For all *Pr* in *R* but not in U(*R*, *E*), there is a *Pr*$^\prime$
    in U(*R*, *E*) such that *Pr*$^\prime$(*p*  *E*) \< *Pr*(*p*)

It isn't too hard to show that for some models, updating on *E* does not
lower the credence of *E* ${\supset}$ *H*, if lowering is understood
this way. The following is an extreme example, but it suffices to make
the logical point. Let *R* be the minimal representor, the set of all
probability functions that assign probability 1 to a priori certainties.
And let U(*R*, *E*) be the singleton of the following probability
function, defined only over Boolean combinations of *E* and *H*:
*Pr*(*E* ${\wedge}$ *H*) = *Pr*(*E* ${\wedge}$ ${\lnot}$*H*) =
*Pr*(${\lnot}$*E* ${\wedge}$ *H*) =
*Pr*(${\lnot}$*E* ${\wedge}$ ${\lnot}$*H*) = $\frac{1}{4}$. Then the
probability of *E* ${\supset}$ *H* after updating is $\frac{3}{4}$.
(More precisely, according to all *Pr* in U(*R*, *E*),
*Pr*(*E* ${\supset}$ *H*) = $\frac{3}{4}$.) Since before updating there
were *Pr* in *R* such that *Pr*(*E* ${\supset}$ *H*) \< $\frac{3}{4}$,
in fact there were *Pr* in *R* such that *Pr*(*E* ${\supset}$ *H*) = 0,
updating on *E* did not *lower* the credence of *E* ${\supset}$ *H*. So
the dynamic Keynesian model does not, in general, have as a consequence
that updating on *E* lowers the credence of *E* ${\supset}$ *H*. This
suggests that [Lower]{.smallcaps} in general is not true.

It might be objected that if evidence *E* supports our knowledge that
*E* ${\supset}$ *H*, then updating on *E* should *raise* the credence of
*E* ${\supset}$ *H*. And if we define credence raising the same way we
just defined credence lowering, updating on *E* *never* raises the
credence of *E* ${\supset}$ *H*. From a Keynesian perspective, we should
simply deny that evidence has to raise the credence of the propositions
known on the basis of that evidence. It might be sufficient that getting
this evidence removes the uncertainty associated with those
propositions. Even on the static Keynesian model, it is possible for
evidence to remove uncertainty related to propositions without raising
the probability of that proposition. A little informally, we might note
that whether an agent with representor *R* is sufficiently confident in
*p* to know that *p* depends on the lowest value that *Pr*(*p*) takes
for *Pr* ${\in}$ *R*, and updating can raise the value of this 'lower
bound' without raising the value of *Pr*(*p*) according to all functions
in *R*, and hence without strictly speaking *raising* the credence of
*p*.

The above illustration is obviously unrealistic, in part because U could
not behave that way. It's tempting at this stage to ask just how U does
behave so we can work out if there are more realistic examples. Indeed,
it's tempting to try to attempt to provide a formal description of U.
This temptation should be resisted. The whole point of the model is that
we can only learn which hypotheses are supported by certain evidence by
actually getting that evidence. If we could say just what U is, we would
be able to know what was supported by any kind of evidence without
getting that evidence. The best we can do with respect to U is to
discover some of its contours with respect to evidence much like our
own. And the way to make those discoveries will be to do scientific and
epistemological research. It isn't obvious that, say, looking for nice
formal properties of U will help at all.

### The Problem of the Priors

One really nice consequence of the dynamic Keynesian approach is that it
lets us say what the representor of an agent with no empirical
information should be. Say a proposition is *a priori certain* iff it is
a priori that all rational agents assign credence 1 to that proposition.
Then the representor of the agent with no empirical evidence is {*Pr*:
${\forall}$*p*: If *p* is a priori certain, then *Pr*(*p*) = 1}. This is
the minimal representor I mentioned above. Apart from assigning
probability 1 to the a priori certainties, the representor is silent.
Hence it treats all propositions that are not a priori certain in
exactly the same way. This kind of symmetric treatment of propositions
is not possible on the traditional Bayesian conception for logical
reasons. (The reasons are set out in the various discussions of the
paradoxes of indifference, going back to @Bertrand1888.) Such a prior
representor is consistent with the static Keynesian approach, but it
yields implausible results, since conditionalising on *E* has no effect
on the distribution of values of Pr(*p*) among functions in the
representor for any *p* not made a priori certain by *E*. (We'll say *p*
is made a priori certain by *E* iff *E* ${\supset}$ *p* is a priori
certain.) So if this is our starting representor, we can't even get
probabilistic evidence for things that are not made certain by our
evidence.[^6] So on the static Keynesian model, this attractively
symmetric prior representor is not available.

I think one of the motivations of anti-dogmatist thinking is the thought
that we *should* be able to tell a priori what is evidence for what. If
it looking like there is a cow in front of us is a reason to think there
is a cow in front of us, that should be knowable a priori. I think the
motivation for this kind of position shrinks a little when we realise
that an a priori prior that represented all the connections between
evidence and hypotheses would have to give us a lot of guidance as to
what to do (epistemically speaking) in worlds quite unlike our own.
Moreover, there is no reason we should have lots that information. So
consider, for a minute, a soul in a world with no spatial dimensions and
three temporal dimensions, where the primary source of evidence for
souls is empathic connection with other souls from which they get a
(fallible) guide to those souls' mental states. When such a soul
conditionalises on the evidence "A soul seems to love me" (that's the
kind of evidence they get) what should their posterior probability be
that there is indeed a soul that loves them? What if the souls have a
very alien mental life, so they instantiate mental concepts very unlike
our own, and souls get fallible evidence of these alien concepts being
instantiated through empathy? I think it's pretty clear we *don't* know
the answers to these questions. (Note that to answer this question we'd
have to know which of these concepts were grue-like, and which were
projectable, and there is no reason to believe we are in a position to
know that.) Now those souls are presumably just as ignorant about the
epistemologically appropriate reaction to the kinds of evidence we get,
like seeing a cow or hearing a doorbell, as we are about their evidence.
The dynamic Keynesian model can allow for this, especially if we use the
very weak prior representor described above. When we get the kind of
evidence we actually get, the effect of U is to shrink our representors
to sets of probability functions which are broadly speaking
epistemically appropriate for the kind of world we are in. Before we got
that evidence, we didn't know how we should respond to it, just like the
spaceless empathic souls don't know how to respond to it, just like we
don't know how to respond to their evidence.

It is a commonplace observation that (a) prior probabilities are really
crucial in Bayesian epistemology, but (b) we have next to no idea what
they look like. I call this the problem of the priors, and note with
some satisfaction that the dynamic Keynesian model avoids it. Now a
cynic might note that all I've done is replace a hand-wavy story about
priors with a hand-wavy story about updating. That's true, but
nevertheless I think this is progress. The things I'm being deliberately
unclear about, such as what U should look like for *E* such as "Some
other non-spatial tri-temporal soul seems to love me" are things that
(a) my theory says are not a priori knowable, and (b) I don't have any
evidence concerning. So it isn't surprising that I don't have much to
say about them. It isn't clear that the traditional Bayesian can offer
any story, even by their own lights, as to why they are less clear about
the structure of the prior probability conditional on such an *E*.

### The Problem of Old Evidence

When we get evidence *E*, the dynamic Keynesian model says that we
should do two things. First, we should throw out some probability
functions in our representor. Second, we should conditionalise those
that remain. But this is a normative condition, not a description of
what actually happens. Sometimes, when we get evidence *E*, we may not
realise that it is evidence that supports some theory *T*. That is, we
won't sufficiently cull the representor of those probability functions
where the probability of *T* given *E* is not high. Housecleaning like
this is hard, and sometimes we only do it when it becomes essential. In
this case, that means we only do it when we start paying serious
attention to *T*. In that case we may find that evidence *E*, evidence
we've already incorporated, in the sense of having used in
conditionalisation, gives us reason to be more confident than we were in
*T*. In such a case we'll simply cull those functions where probability
of *T* given *E* is not high, and we will be more confident in *T*.
That's how old evidence can be relevant on the dynamic Keynesian model.
Since we have a story about how old evidence can be relevant, there is
no problem of old evidence for the dynamic Keynesian.

Famously, there *is* a problem of old evidence for traditional
Bayesians. Now I'm not going to rehearse all the arguments concerning
this problem to convince you that this problem hasn't been solved.
That's in part because it would take too long and in part because I'm
not sure myself that it hasn't been solved. But I will note that if you
think the problem of old evidence *is* a live problem for traditional
Bayesians, then you have a strong reason for taking the dynamic
Keynesian model seriously.

### Why Should We Care?

The sceptic's opening move was to appeal to our intuition that
propositions like *E* ${\supset}$ *H* are unknowable. We then asked what
reasons we could be given for accepting this claim, because the sceptic
seems to want to derive quite a lot from a raw intuition. The sceptic
can respond with a wide range of arguments, four of which are mentioned
above. Here we focussed on the sceptic's argument from exhaustion.
*E* ${\supset}$ *H* isn't knowable a priori, because it could be false,
and it isn't knowable a posteriori, because, on standard models of
learning, our evidence *lowers* its credibility. My response is to say
that this is an artefact of the model the sceptic (along with everyone
else) is using. There's nothing wrong with using simplified models, in
fact it is usually the only way to make progress, but we must be always
wary that our conclusions transfer from the model to the real world. One
way to argue that a conclusion is a mere artefact of the model is to
come up with a model that is sensitive to more features of reality in
which the conclusion does not hold. That's what I've done here. The
dynamic Keynesian model is sensitive to the facts that (a) there is a
distinction between risk and uncertainty and (b) we can learn about
fundamental evidential connections. In the dynamic Keynesian model, it
isn't true that our evidence lowers the probability of
*E* ${\supset}$ *H*. So the anti-sceptic who says that
*E* ${\supset}$ *H* is knowable a posteriori, the person I've called the
dogmatist, has a defence against this Bayesian argument. If the response
is successful, then there may well be other applications of the dynamic
Keynesian model, but for now I'm content to show how the model can be
used to defend the dogmatic response to scepticism.

[^1]: Perhaps not a wise assumption around here, but one that I'll make
    throughout in what follows.

[^2]: Again, the proof uses distinctively classical principles, in
    particular the equivalence of A with (A ${\wedge}$ B) ${\vee}$ (A
    ${\wedge}$ ${\lnot}$B.) But I will take classical logic for granted
    throughout. David Jehle pointed out to me that the proof fails
    without this classical assumption.

[^3]: Roger @White2006 and Stewart @Cohen2005 endorse probabilistic
    arguments against people who are, in my sense, dogmatists. John
    @Hawthorne2002 also makes a similar argument when arguing that
    certain conditionals, much like E ${\supset}$ H, are a priori.

[^4]: The clearest statement of the distinction that I know is from that
    paper.

[^5]: Strictly speaking, the story I've told so far does not guarantee
    that for any proposition *p*, the values that Pr(*p*) takes (for Pr
    in the representor) form an interval. But it is usual in more
    detailed presentations of the model to put constraints on the
    representor to guarantee that happens, and I'll assume we've done
    that.

[^6]: The argument in the text goes by a little quickly, because I've
    defined representors in terms on unconditional probabilities and
    this leads to complications to do with conditionalising on
    propositions of zero probability. A better thing to do, as suggested
    by @Hajek2003, is to take conditional probability as primitive. If
    we do this we'll define representors as sets of conditional
    probability functions, and the a priori representor will be {Pr: If
    *p* ${\supset}$ *q* is a priori certain, then Pr(*q* *p*) = 1}. Then
    the claim in the text will follow.
