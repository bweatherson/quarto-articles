title: "Questioning Contextualism"
description: |
  This chapter argues against the pragmatism that shows that there is a striking disanalogy between the behavior of “knows” in questions and the behavior of “knows” in terms. The chapter discusses that different people may have different standards for knowledge, so perhaps they may mean different things by a statement, because they communicate to meet their preferred standards for knowledge. Standards for knowledge are not the kind of thing that people can differ on without making a mistake, in the way one would say that different people can have different immediate goals (about what to have for dinner) without making a mistake. This explains that one does not just adopt questioners' standards for knowledge while answering their knowledge questions. So, it is argued that questions involving “knows” should have the three properties—speaker, clarification, and different answers. However, the counter argument is that the proposition can be true relative to some contexts and false relative to other contexts, just as temporality about propositions that a proposition can be true at some times and false at other times, and the utterance is true if the proposition is true only in the context of the utterance.

There are currently a dizzying variety of theories on the market holding
that whether an utterance of the form *A knows that p* is true depends
on pragmatic or contextual factors. Even if we allow that pragmatics
matters, there are three questions to be answered. First, *whose*
interests matter? Here there are three options: the interests of *A*
matter, the interests of the person making the knowledge ascription
matter, or the interests of the person evaluating the ascription matter.
Second, *which* kind of pragmatic factors matter? Broadly speaking, the
debate here is about whether practical interests (the stakes involved)
or intellectual interests (which propositions are being considered) are
most important. Third, *how* do pragmatic factors matter? Here there is
not even a consensus about what the options are.

</aside>

This paper is about the first question. I'm going to present some data
from the behaviour of questions about who knows what that show it is not
the interests of the person making the knowledge ascription that matter.
This means the view normally known as *contextualism* about
knowledge-ascriptions is false. Since that term is a little contested,
and for some suggests merely the view that someone's context matters,
I'll introduce three different terms for the three answers to the first
question.

Consider a token utterance by B of *A knows that p*. This utterance is
being evaluated by C. A *semantic pragmatist* about knowledge
ascriptions says that whether C can correctly evaluate that utterance as
true or false depends on some salient party's context or interests.[^1]
We can produce a quick taxonomy of semantic pragmatist positions by
looking at which of the three parties is the salient one.

Type A pragmatism

:   A's context or interests matter.

Type B pragmatism

:   B's context or interests matter.

Type C pragmatism

:   C's context or interests matter.

Type A pragmatism is defended by @Hawthorne2004 under the name
'subject-sensitive invariantism' and @Stanley2005-STAKAP under the name
'interest-relative invariantism'. The theory commonly known as
*contextualism*, defended by @Cohen1986, @DeRose1995 and @Lewis1996b, is
a form of *Type B* pragmatism. On their theory, the semantic value of
'knows' depends on the context in which it is uttered, i.e. B's context.
(And the salient feature of B's context is, broadly speaking, B's
interests.) Recently @MacFarlane2009-MACNC has outlined a very different
variant of Type B pragmatism that we will discuss below. Type C
pragmatism is the radical view that the token utterance does not have a
context-invariant truth value, so one and the same utterance can be
properly evaluated as true by one evaluator and false by another. This
position is outlined, and defended, by @MacFarlane2005-Knowledge.

The purpose of this paper is to argue *against* Type B pragmatism. I'll
show that there is a striking disanalogy between the behaviour of
'knows' in questions and the behaviour of terms for which a Type B-type
theory is true. The best explanation for this disanalogy is that Type B
theories, contextualism included, are false.[^2]

I won't be addressing the second or third questions here, but I'll
assume (basically for ease of exposition) that the right answer to the
second has more to do with *practical* than *intellectual* interests. So
a sceptical possibility becomes relevant not because anyone is actively
considering it, but because it makes a difference to someone's actions.
Everything I say here should be restatable given any answer to that
question, so little beyond exposition turns on this.

### Basic Indexicals in Questions

As well as considering these three pragmatic theories about 'know', we
can consider similar theories about other words. We'll start with words
that are universally considered to be indexicals. Consider the following
three theories about 'here'.

Type A pragmatism

:   A token of 'here' denotes the location of the subject of the
    sentence in which it appears.

Type B pragmatism

:   A token of 'here' denotes the location of the speaker.

Type C pragmatism

:   A token of 'here' denotes the location of the person evaluating the
    sentence.

So when C evaluates B's utterance *A is here*, the Type A pragmatist
says that it gets evaluated as true iff A is where A is, the Type B
pragmatist says that it gets evaluated as true iff A is where B is, and
the Type C pragmatist says that it gets evaluated as true iff A is where
C is. Obviously Type B pragmatism is true in general about 'here', as it
is for all obvious indexicals.[^3] What we're interested in for now,
however, is not its truth but the kind of evidence that can be adduced
for it. One very simple way of separating out these three theories
involves questions, as in the following example.

Watson is at a party in Liverpool, and he is worried that Moriarty is
there as well. He calls Holmes, who is tracking Moriarty's movements by
satellite, and asks (1).

This question has three properties that are distinctive of questions
involving indexicals.

SPEAKER

:   How Holmes should answer the question depends on the speaker's (i.e.
    Watson's) environment, not his own and not Moriarty's. It would be
    wrong to say "Yes" because Moriarty is where he is, or "No" because
    Moriarty is not in the lab with Holmes following the satellite
    movement.

CLARIFICATION

:   It is permissible in certain contexts to ask the speaker for more
    information about their context before answering. If Holmes's is
    unsure of Watson's location, he can reply with "Where are you?"
    rather than answering directly.[^4]

DIFFERENT ANSWERS

:   If two different people, who are in different locations, ask Holmes
    (1), he can answer differently. Assume that Moriarty is at the
    party, so Holmes says "Yes" in reply to Watson. Lestrade then calls
    from Scotland Yard, because he is worried that Moriarty has broken
    in and asks Holmes (1). Holmes says "No", and this is consistent
    with his previous answer.

Questions involving indexicals have a fourth property that we'll return
to from time to time in what follows.

NEGATIVE AGREEMENT

:   It is coherent to answer the question by saying "No", then basically
    repeating the question, inverting the verb-subject order so you have
    an indicative sentence. So Holmes could consistently (if falsely in
    this story) say, "No, Moriarty is here."

The truth of Type B Pragmatism about 'here' explains, indeed predicts,
that (1) has these properties. If a correct answer is a true answer,
then Type B Pragmatism directly entails that (1) has SPEAKER. That
assumption (that correctness is truth) plus the fact that you can speak
to someone without knowing their location implies that (1) has
CLARIFICATION, and adding the fact that different people can be in
different locations implies that (1) has DIFFERENT ANSWERS. Whether
Holmes can say *Moriarty is here* depends whether he can truthfully
answer his own question *Is Moriarty here?* so NEGATIVE AGREEMENT is
related to DIFFERENT ANSWERS. For these reasons it isn't surprising that
other terms that are agreed on all sides to be indexicals generate
questions that have all four properties. For instance, because 'me' is
an indexical, (2) has all four properties.

This suggests a hypothesis, that all terms for which Type B pragmatism
is true generate questions with those four properties. This hypothesis
seems to be false; some terms for which Type B pragmatism is true do not
generate questions that have NEGATIVE AGREEMENT. But a weaker claim,
that all terms for which Type B pragmatism is true generate questions
with the first three properties, does seem to be true.[^5] Or so I will
argue in the next section.

### Other Type B terms in Questions

Various philosophers have argued that a version of Type B pragmatism is
true for each of the following four terms: 'tall', 'empty', 'ready' and
'everyone'. Various defenders of Type B pragmatism about 'knows' have
argued that 'knows' is analogous to terms on this list. In this section
I'll argue that questions involving those four terms have the first
three properties of questions listed above, though they don't seem to
have NEGATIVE AGREEMENT. In the next section I'll argue that questions
involving 'know' do not have those three properties. These facts combine
to form an argument against the hypothesis that Type B pragmatism is
true of 'knows'. (The argument here does not turn on supposing that Type
B pragmatism is true of these four terms. All I want to argue for is the
claim that any term for which Type B pragmatism is true generates
questions with the first three properties. It is possible that other
terms also generate these kinds of questions, but this possibility
doesn't threaten the argument.) The examples involving these four terms
will be a little complicated, but the intuitions about them are clear.

Moriarty has hired a new lackey, a twelve year old jockey. She is tall
for a twelve year old girl, and tall for a jockey, but not tall for a
person. Moriarty is most interested in her abilities as a jockey, so he
worries that she's tall. Holmes is also most interested in her *qua*
jockey. Watson has noted that Moriarty never hires people who are tall
for adults (he thinks this is because Moriarty likes lording over his
lackeys) and is wondering whether the new hire fits this property. He
asks Holmes (3).

Holmes should say "No". What matters is whether she is tall *by the
standards Watson cares about*, not whether she is tall by the standards
Holmes cares about (i.e. jockeys) or the standards Moriarty cares about
(i.e. also jockeys). So (3) has SPEAKER. Lestrade wants information from
Holmes about the lackey so his men can pick her up. They have this
conversation.

> Lestrade: Is Moriarty's new lackey tall? My men are looking for her.
>
> Holmes: Where are they looking?
>
> Lestrade: At her school.
>
> Holmes: Yes, she looks like she could be fourteen or fifteen.

Holmes quite properly asks for a clarification of the question so as to
work out what standards for tallness are in play, so (3) has
CLARIFICATION. And he properly gives different answers to Watson and
Lestrade, so it has DIFFERENT ANSWERS. But note that 'tall' doesn't have
NEGATIVE AGREEMENT. Holmes can't answer (3) with "No, she's tall." I
won't repeat this observation for the other terms discussed in this
section, but the point generalises.

Next we'll consider 'empty'. Holmes and Watson are stalking Moriarty at
a party. Watson is mixing poisons, and Holmes is trying to slip the
poison into Moriarty's glass. Unfortunately Moriarty has just about
finished his drink, and might be about to abandon it. Watson is
absent-mindedly trying to concoct the next poison, but he seems to have
run out of mixing dishes.

> Watson: Is Moriarty's glass empty?
>
> Holmes: What do you want it for?
>
> Watson: I need something dry to mix this poison in.
>
> Holmes: No, it's got a small bit of ice left in it.
>
> (Lestrade arrives, and sees Holmes holding a vial.)
>
> Lestrade: Why haven't you moved in? Is Moriarty's glass empty?
>
> Holmes: Yes. He should get another soon.

Holmes behaves entirely appropriately here, and his three responses show
that the question *Is Moriarty's glass empty?* has the CLARIFICATION,
SPEAKER and DIFFERENT ANSWERS properties respectively. Note in
particular that the glass is empty by the standards that matter to
Moriarty and Holmes (i.e. it's got not much more than ice left in it)
doesn't matter to how Holmes should answer until someone with the same
interests, Lestrade, asks about the glass.

Third, we'll look at 'ready'. Moriarty is planning four things: to rob
the Bank of England, to invade Baker St and kill Holmes, to invade
Scotland Yard to free his friends, and to leave for a meeting of
criminals where they will plan for the three missions. Moriarty cares
most about the first plan, Holmes about the second, and Lestrade about
the third, but right now Watson cares most about the fourth because it's
his job to track Moriarty to the meeting. Holmes is tracking Moriarty
through an installed spycam.

> Watson: Is Moriarty ready?
>
> Holmes: Yes. You should go now.
>
> (Watson departs and Lestrade arrives)
>
> Lestrade: Is Moriarty ready?
>
> Holmes: Who's that? Oh, hello Inspector. No, he still has to plan the
> attack out.

Again, Holmes's answers show that the question *Is Moriarty ready?* has
the CLARIFICATION, SPEAKER and DIFFERENT ANSWERS properties. Note that
in this case the issue of whether Moriarty is ready for the thing he
cares most about, and the issue of whether he is ready for the thing
Holmes cares most about, are not relevant to Holmes's answers. It is the
interests of the different speakers that matter, which suggests that if
one of the three types of pragmatism is true about 'ready', it is Type B
pragmatism.

Finally we'll look at 'everyone'. @Lewis1996b suggests that 'know' is
directly analogous to 'every', so the two words should behave the same
way in questions. Moriarty's gang just robbed a department store while
the royal family, along with many police, were there. Holmes is most
interested in how this affected the royals, Watson in how the public
reacted, Lestrade in how his police reacted, and Moriarty merely in his
men and his gold. The public, and the royals, were terrified by the raid
on the store, but the police reacted bravely.

> Watson: Did Moriarty's men terrify everyone?
>
> Holmes: Her majesty and her party were quite shocked. Oh, you mean
> *everyone*. Yes, the masses there were completely stunned.
>
> (Lestrade enters.)
>
> Lestrade: I just heard about the raid. How did they get through
> security? Did Moriarty's men terrify everyone?
>
> Holmes: No, your men did their job, but they were outnumbered.

Again, Holmes's answers show that the question *Did Moriarty's men
terrify everyone?* has the CLARIFICATION, SPEAKER and DIFFERENT ANSWERS
properties. And again, what the quantifier domain would be if Holmes
were to use the word 'everyone', namely all the royal family, is
irrelevant to how he should answer a question involving 'everyone'.
That's the distinctive feature of expressions for which Type B
pragmatism is true, and it suggests that in this respect at least
'everyone' behaves as if Type B pragmatism is true of it.

### Questions about Knowledge

We have two reasons for thinking that if Type B pragmatism is true about
'knows', then questions about knowledge should have all the SPEAKER,
CLARIFICATION and DIFFERENT ANSWERS properties. First, the assumption
that correct answers are true answers plus trivial facts about the
environment (namely that environments are not always fully known and
differ between speakers) implies that the questions have these
properties. Second, many words that are either uncontroversial or
controversial instances where Type B pragmatism is true generate
questions with these properties. So if 'knows' is meant to be analogous
to these controversial examples, questions about knowledge should have
these properties. I'll argue in this section that knowledge questions do
not have these properties. Again we'll work through a long example to
show this.

Last week Watson discovered where Moriarty was storing a large amount of
gold, and retrieved it. Moriarty is now coming to Baker St to try to get
the gold back, and Holmes is planning a trap for him. Moriarty has made
educated guesses that it was Watson (rather than Holmes) who retrieved
the gold, and that Holmes is planning a trap at Baker St Station. But he
doesn't have a lot of evidence for either proposition. Holmes has been
spying on Moriarty, so he knows that Moriarty is in just this position.
Neither Moriarty nor Holmes care much about who it was who retrieved the
gold from Moriarty's vault, but this is very important to Watson, who
plans to write a book about it. On the other hand, that Holmes is
planning a trap at Baker St Station is very important to both Holmes and
Moriarty, but surprisingly unimportant to Watson. He would prefer that
he was the hero of the week for recovering the gold, not Holmes for
capturing Moriarty. They have this conversation.

> Watson: Does Moriarty know that you've got a trap set up at Baker St
> Station?
>
> Holmes: No, he's just guessing. If I set up a diversion I'm sure I can
> get him to change his mind.
>
> Watson: Does he know it was me who recovered the gold?
>
> Holmes: Yes, dear Watson, he figured that out.

These answers sound to me like the answers Holmes *should* give. Because
the trap is practically important to both him and Moriarty, it seems he
should say no to the first question unless Moriarty has very strong
evidence.[^6] But because it is unimportant to Holmes and Moriarty just
what *Watson* did, the fact that Moriarty has a true belief that's based
on the right evidence that Watson recovered the gold is sufficient for
Holmes to answer the second question "Yes". This shows that questions
involving 'knows' do not have the SPEAKER property.

Some might dispute the intuitions involved here, but note that on a
simple Type B pragmatist theory, one that sets the context just by the
*speaker's* interests (as opposed to the speaker *and* her
interlocutors) Holmes should assent to (4) and (5).

And it is *very* intuitive that if he should assent to (4) and (5), then
he should answer "No" to Watson's first question, and "Yes" to the
second.

Some adherents of a more sophisticated Type B pragmatist theory will not
say that Holmes should assent to these two, because they think he should
take Watson's interests on board in his use of 'knows'. This is the
'single scoreboard view' of Keith @DeRose2004.[^7] But we can, with a
small addition of complexity rearrange the case so as to avoid this
complication. Imagine that Watson is not talking to Holmes, but to
Lestrade, and that Lestrade (surprisingly) shares Watson's interests.
Unbeknownst to the two of them, Holmes is listening in to their
conversation via a bug. When listening in to conversations, Holmes has
the habit of answering any questions that are asked, even if they
obviously aren't addressed to him. (I do the same thing when watching
sports broadcasts, though the questions are often mind-numbingly bland.
Listening to the intuitive answers one gives is a good guide to the
content of the question.) So the conversation now goes as follows.

> Watson: Does Moriarty know that Holmes has got a trap set up at Baker
> St Station?
>
> Holmes (eavesdropping): No, he's just guessing. If I set up a
> diversion I'm sure I can get him to change his mind.
>
> Lestrade: I'm not sure. My Moriarty spies aren't doing that well.
>
> Watson: Does he know it was me who recovered the gold?
>
> Holmes (eavesdropping): Yes, dear Watson, he figured that out.

It is important here that Holmes is talking *to himself*, even though he
is using Watson's questions to guide what he says. So it will be a
*very* extended sense of context if somehow Watson's interests guide
Holmes's context. Some speakers may be moved by empathy to align their
interests with the people they are speaking about, but *Holmes* is not
such a speaker. So Type B pragmatic theories should say that Holmes
should endorse (4) and (5) in this context, and intuitively if this is
true he should speak in the above interaction just as I have recorded.
But this is just to say that questions about knowledge do not have
SPEAKER.[^8]

One might worry that we're changing the rules, since we did not use
eavesdropping situations above in arguing that if Type B pragmatism is
true of 'knows', then questions about knowledge should have SPEAKER. But
it is a simple exercise to check that even if Holmes is eavesdropping,
his answers to questions including 'tall', 'empty', 'ready' and
'everyone' should still have the three properties. So this change of
scenery does not tilt the deck against the Type B pragmatist.

Cases like this one also suggest that questions involving 'knows' also
lack the CLARIFICATION and DIFFERENT ANSWERS property. It would be odd
of Holmes to reply to one of Watson's questions with "How much does it
matter to you?", as it would be in any case where a questioner who knows
that *p* asks whether *S* also knows that *p*. Intuitions about cases
where the questioner does not know that *p* are a little trickier,
because then the respondent can only answer 'yes' if she has sufficient
evidence to assure the speaker that *p*, and it is quite plausible that
the amount of evidence needed to assure someone that *p* varies with the
interests of the person being assured.[^9] But if Type B pragmatism were
true, we'd expect to find cases of CLARIFICATION where it is common
ground that the speaker knows *p*, and yet a request for standards is in
order, and no such cases seem to exist. Similarly, it's hard to imagine
circumstances where Holmes would offer a different answer if Lestrade
rather than Watson asked the questions. And more generally, if two
questioners who each know that *p* ask whether S knows that *p*, it is
hard to see how it could be apt to answer them differently.[^10] But if
Type B pragmatism about 'knows' were true, knowledge questions would
have these three properties, so it follows that Type B pragmatism about
'knows' is false.

### Objections and Replies

*Objection*: The argument that Type B pragmatism implies that questions
involving 'knows' should have the three properties assumes that correct
answers are true answers. But there are good Gricean reasons to think
that there are other standards for correctness.

*Reply*: It is true that one of the arguments for thinking that Type B
pragmatism has this implication uses this assumption. But the other
argument, the argument from analogy with indexicals and other terms for
which Type B pragmatism is true, does not. Whatever one thinks of the
theory, there is data here showing that 'knows' does not behave in
questions like other context-sensitive terms for which Type B pragmatism
is the most plausible view.

Moreover, Type B pragmatists have to be very careful wielding this
objection. If there is a substantial gap between correct answers to
knowledge questions and true answers, then it is likely that there is a
substantial gap between correct knowledge ascriptions and true knowledge
ascriptions. As a general (though not universal) rule, truth and
correctness are more tightly connected for questions than for simple
statements. For example, some utterances do not generate all the scalar
implicatures as answers to questions that they typically generate when
asserted unprompted.[^11] But the primary 'ordinary language' argument
for Type B pragmatism about knowledge ascriptions assumes that correct
knowledge ascriptions are, by and large, true.

We can put this in more theoretical terms. If we are to use these
considerations to generate a *rebutting* defeater for Type B pragmatism,
we would need an argument that Holmes's answers are correct iff they are
true. And while that step of the argument is plausible, it is not beyond
contention. But that isn't the only use of the examples. We can also use
them to *undercut* the argument from ordinary language to Type B
pragmatism. We have a wide range of cases where ordinary usage is as if
Type B pragmatism is false. And these cases are not peripheral or
obscure features of ordinary usage. Answering questions is one of the
most common things we do with language. So ordinary usage doesn't
provide an all things considered reason to believe that Type B
pragmatism is true. If ordinary usage is (or at least was) the best
reason to believe Type B pragmatism, it follows that there is no good
reason to believe Type B pragmatism.

*Objection*: Sometimes when we ask *Does S know that p?* all we want to
know is whether *S* has the information that *p*. In this mood,
questions of justification are not relevant. But Type B pragmatism is a
theory about the interaction between the subject's *justification* and
knowledge ascriptions. So these questions are irrelevant to evaluating
indexicalism.[^12]

*Reply*: It is plausible that there is this use of knowledge questions.
It seems to me that this is a usage that needs to be explained, and
isn't easily explained on current theories of knowledge.[^13] But I'll
leave discussion of that use of knowledge questions for another day. For
now I'll just note that even if this can be an explanation of why we
sometimes *assent* to knowledge questions, it can't be an explanation of
why Holmes *denies* that Moriarty knows about the planned trap at Baker
St Station. Holmes agrees that Moriarty *believes* there is a trap
planned, but insists that because Moriarty is 'just guessing' that this
belief does not amount to knowledge. What really needs explaining is the
difference between Holmes's two answers, and this other use of knowledge
questions doesn't seem sufficient to generate that explanation.

*Objection*: There is no explanation offered here for the data, and we
shouldn't give up an explanatory theory without an explanation of why it
fails.

*Reply*: The best way to explain the data is to look at some differences
in our attitudes towards questions containing 'knows' and questions
containing other terms for which Type B pragmatism is plausibly true.
I'll just go over the difference between 'knows' and 'ready', the point
I'm making easily generalises to the other cases.

Different people may be concerned with different bits of preparation, so
they may (speaker) mean different things by *X is ready*. But neither
will regard the other as making a *mistake* when they focus on a
particular bit of preparing to talk about by saying *X is ready*. And
this is true even if they think that the person *should* be thinking
about something else that X is preparing.

Knowledge cases are not like that. Different people may have different
standards for knowledge, so perhaps they may (speaker) mean different
things by *A knows that p*, because they will communicate that *A* has
met their preferred standards for knowledge. But in these cases, each
will regard the other as making a *mistake*. Standards for knowledge
aren't the kind of thing we say people can differ on without making a
mistake, in the way we do (within reason) say that different people can
have different immediate goals (e.g. about what to have for dinner)
without making a mistake. That explains why we don't just adopt our
questioners standards for knowledge when answering their knowledge
questions.

*Objection*: In section 2 it was argued that questions involving 'knows'
should have the three properties because questions involving other terms
for which Type B pragmatism is true have the properties. But this
argument by analogy may be flawed. All those terms are 'indexical' in
John MacFarlane's sense [@MacFarlane2009-MACNC]. That is, the *content*
of any utterance of them varies with the context. But not all Type B
pragmatist theories are indexical, and this argument does not tell
against a non-indexical Type B pragmatism.

*Reply*: The view under consideration says that all utterances of '*S*
knows that *p*' express the same proposition, namely that *S* knows that
*p*. But the view is Type B because it says that proposition can be true
relative to some contexts and false relative to other contexts, just as
temporalists about propositions say that a proposition can be true at
some times and false at other times, and the utterance is true iff the
proposition is true in the context of the utterance. This *is* a Type B
view, and I agree that the argument by analogy in section 2 is powerless
against it.

But that argument was not the only argument that Type B views are
committed to questions involving 'knows' having the three properties.
There was also an argument, at the end of section 1, from purely
theoretical considerations. It turns out this argument is also
complicated to apply here, but it does tell against this type of Type B
pragmatist as well.

Here are two hypotheses about how one should answer a question *Does NP
VP?* where NP is a noun phrase and VP a verb phrase. Consider the
proposition expressed by the sentence *NP VP* in the speaker's context.
First hypothesis: the correct answer is 'Yes' iff that proposition is
true in the speaker's context. Second hypothesis: the correct answer is
'Yes' iff that proposition is true in the respondent's context. If
propositions do not change their truth value between contexts, these two
hypotheses are equivalent, but on this version of Type B pragmatism that
is not so, so we have to decide between them. The best way to do this is
by thinking about cases where it is common ground that propositions
change their truth value between contexts, namely cases where the
contexts are possible worlds. Let's consider the scenario I briefly
discussed above of the television watcher answering whatever question
gets asked. Above I put the questioners in the same possible world as
me, but we can imagine they are fictional characters in a different
possible world. Imagine a show where it has just been revealed to the
audience, but not all the characters, that the Prime Minister is a space
alien. The following happens.

> Character (on screen): Is the Prime Minister a space alien?
>
> Me (in real world): Yes!

Since the proposition that the Prime Minister is a space alien is true
in their world, but not in our world, the propriety of this response
tells in favour of the first hypothesis above. Now this is not a
conclusive argument, because it might be that there is some distinctive
feature of fiction that is causing this answer, even though the second
hypothesis is in general correct. But it seems we have reason to think
that *if* this kind of Type B pragmatism were true, respondents would
use the speaker's context to work out what kind of answer to give. And
as we saw above, this is not what respondents *actually* do, they either
use their own context or (more likely) the subject's.

*Objection*: At most this shows that Type B pragmatism about 'knows' is
not actually true of English. But there might still be good
epistemological reasons to adopt it as a philosophically motivated
revision, even if the data from questions shows it isn't true. So even
if hermeneutic Type B pragmatism is false, revolutionary Type B
pragmatism might be well motivated.

*Reply*: It's true that the philosophically most interesting concepts
may not map exactly on to the meanings of words in natural language.
(Though I think we should be careful before abandoning the concepts that
have proven useful enough to get simple representation in the language.)
And it's true that there are reasons for having epistemological concepts
that are sensitive to pragmatic factors. But what is hard to see is what
interest we could have in having epistemological terms whose application
is sensitive to the interests of the person using them. @Hawthorne2004
provides many reasons for thinking that terms whose applications are
sensitive to the interests of the person to whom they are being applied
are philosophically and epistemologically valuable. Such terms provide
ways of expressing unified judgements about the person's intellectual
and practical reasoning. On the other hand, there is little to be gained
by *adopting* Type B pragmatism. If there needs to be a revision around
here, and my guess is that there does not, it should be towards Type A,
not Type B, pragmatism.

[^1]: Note that the focus here is on the truth or falsity of the
    utterance, and not on the truth or falsity of the proposition the
    utterance expresses. I'm indebted to John MacFarlane for stressing
    to me the importance of this distinction.

[^2]: My own view is that if any pragmatic theory is true, it is Type A
    pragmatism. In @Weatherson2005-WEACWD I defend the view that whether
    an agent is sufficiently confident in *p* to count as believing that
    *p* depends on features of her context. In contexts where it is very
    important for practical deliberation whether *p* is true, a degree
    of confidence that might ordinarily count as belief that *p* might
    no longer so count. This is an odd kind of doxastic externalism,
    namely the view that whether a state amounts to a *belief* is
    environment-dependent. Now to know that *p* also requires having a
    certain level of confidence that *p* is true, and it is arguable
    (though I haven't argued it) that this level is also dependent on
    the would be knowers environment. It is also arguable that the best
    theory of epistemic *defeaters* will contain pragmatic features.

    Though I describe Type C pragmatism as radical, I've been convinced
    by John MacFarlane's work that it is a perfectly coherent doctrine.
    In @Egan2005-EGAEMI we defend a version of Type C pragmatism for
    sentences of the form *A might be F*, where *might* is understood
    epistemically.

[^3]: Whether the 'in general' is strictly necessary turns on tricky
    considerations about non-standard usages, such as answering
    machines. I'm generally favourable to the view that if any
    qualification is needed it is a very small one. See
    @Weatherson2002-WEAMI for more discussion of this point.

[^4]: It is important here that we restrict attention to clarificatory
    questions about the context, and in particular to features of the
    context that (allegedly) affect the truth value of utterances
    involving the indexical. Speakers can always ask for clarification
    of all sorts of features of a question, but a question only has
    CLARIFICATION if it is appropriate to ask for clarifying information
    about the nature of the questioner's context.

[^5]: The failure of NEGATIVE AGREEMENT for questions involving
    quantifiers, comparative adjectives and similar terms is interesting
    is interesting, and is something that a full semantic theory should
    account for. My feeling is that the best explanation will draw on
    the resources of a theory like that defended by @Stanley2000-STACAL
    [@Stanley2002-STANR] but it would take us far away from our primary
    purpose to explore this here. It is certainly an argument in favour
    of the 'semantic minimalism' defended by @Cappelen2005 that all and
    only the terms in their 'basic set' (apart from tense markers), i.e.
    the obvious indexicals, generate questions with NEGATIVE AGREEMENT.
    I think the fact that many terms generate questions with the
    SPEAKER, CLARIFICATION and DIFFERENT ANSWERS property tells more
    strongly against their view.

[^6]: The Type A pragmatist says that it is the importance of the trap
    to Moriarty that makes this a high-stakes question, and the Type C
    pragmatist (at least as I understand that view) says that it is the
    importance of the trap to Holmes that matters. Since Moriarty and
    Holmes agree about what is important here, the Type A and Type C
    pragmatists can agree with each other and disagree with the Type B
    pragmatist.

[^7]: The failure of NEGATIVE AGREEMENT for knowledge questions suggests
    that if any contextualist theory is true, it had better be a single
    scoreboard view.

[^8]: As noted above, the Type A and Type C pragmatists agree with this
    intuition, though for very different reasons.

[^9]: With the right supplementary assumptions, I believe this claim can
    be argued to be a consequence of any of our three types of
    pragmatism.

[^10]: The above remarks about cases where the speakers don't know that
    *p* also apply. I think that without a very careful story about how
    the norms governing assertion relate to the interests of the speaker
    and the audience, such cases will not tell us much about the
    semantics of 'knows'. Best then to stick with cases where it is
    common ground that everyone, except the subject, knows that *p*.

[^11]: Here are a couple of illustrations of this point. Yao Ming is
    seven feet six inches tall. It would be odd (at best) to use (6) to
    describe him, but it is clearly improper to answer (7) with 'No'.

    For a second case, consider an example of Hart's that @Grice1989
    uses to motivate his distinction between semantics and pragmatics. A
    motorist drives slowly down the street, pausing at every driveway to
    see if anyone or anything is rushing out. It seems extremely odd to
    use (8) to describe him.

    Is this oddity due to (8) being false, or it being otherwise
    infelicitous? Part of the argument that (8) is true, but
    infelicitous, is that intuitively it is correct to say 'Yes' in
    response to (9), and incorrect to say 'No'.

    The implicatures associated with (8) are largely absent from
    affirmative answers to (9), though such an answer presumably has the
    same truth-conditional content as (8).

[^12]: A similar view is defended by Alvin @Goldman2002.

[^13]: One explanation, due to Stephen @Hetherington2001, is that all
    that is ever required for a *true* ascription of knowledge that *p*
    to S is that *p* is true and S believe it. This leaves open the
    question, as discussed below, of why we sometimes deny that true
    believers are knowers, but we can bring out familiar Gricean
    explanations about why we might usefully deny something that is
    strictly speaking true, or we could follow Hetherington and offer an
    explanation in terms of the gradability of knowledge claims. Another
    possible explanation is that 'know' univocally means something like
    what most epistemologists say that it means, but there is a good
    pragmatic story about why speakers sometimes attribute knowledge to
    those with merely true belief. (I don't know how such an explanation
    would go, especially if Type B pragmatism is not true.) Finally, we
    might follow Goldman and say the English word 'know' is ambiguous
    between a weak and strong reading, and the strong reading has been
    what has concerned epistemologists, and the weak reading just
    requires true belief. Such an ambiguity would be a small concession
    to Type B pragmatism (since it is the interests of the speaker that
    resolve ambiguities) but we could still sensibly ask whether Type B
    pragmatism is true of the strong reading.
