title: "Many Many Problems"
description: | 
   Recently four different papers have suggested that the supervaluational solution to the Problem of the Many is flawed. Stephen Schiffer has argued that the theory cannot account for reports of speech involving vague singular terms. Vann McGee and Brian McLaughlin say that theory cannot, yet, account for vague singular beliefs. Neil McKinnon has argued that we cannot provide a plausible theory of when precisifications are acceptable, which the supervaluational theory needs. And Roy Sorensen argues that supervaluationism is inconsistent with a directly referential theory of names. McGee and McLaughlin see the problem they raise as a cause for further research, but the other authors all take the problems they raise to provide sufficient reasons to jettison supervaluationism. I will argue that none of these problems provide such a reason, though the arguments are valuable critiques. In many cases, we must make some adjustments to the supervaluational theory to meet the posed challenges. The goal of this paper is to make those adjustments, and meet the challenges.

### Schiffer's Problem

Stephen Schiffer suggests the following argument refutes
supervaluationism. The central point is that, allegedly, the
supervaluational theory of vague singular terms says false things about
singular terms in speech reports.

Assuming Bob did point in pretty much the same direction as Alice, it
seems implausible to deny (1). The argument is valid. So the issue is
whether (2) is correct. Schiffer has a quick argument for (2), which I
will paraphrase here. On supervaluational semantics, a sentence is true
iff each of its acceptable precisifications is true. In this case, this
means that if Bob's utterance is true then it must be true however we
precisify 'there'. Each precisification of 'there' will be a (precise)
place, and since 'there' is rather vague, many of these precisifications
will be acceptable. For Bob's utterance to be true, then, Alice must
have said of every one of those places that it was the place where
Harold and her first danced the rumba. But Alice couldn't have said all
those things, so (2) is true.

Schiffer suggests that one way out of this problem would be to accept
the existence of a vague object: the place where Harold and Alice first
danced the rumba. I will note in section four several reasons for
thinking the cost of this move is excessive. Fortunately, there is a
cheaper way home.

Schiffer underestimates the scope of supervaluationism. On Schiffer's
vision of the theory, a precisification assigns a precise content to a
word, and hence to a sentence, then the world determines whether that
content is satisfied, and hence whether the sentence is true on that
precisification. This is hardly an unorthodox view of how
supervaluationism works, it seems for instance to be exactly the view
defended in @Keefe2000, but it is neither the only way, nor the best
way, forward. We could say, rather, that a precisification assigns
content to *every linguistic token in the world*, and the truth
conditions of every one of these tokens is then determined relative to
that global assignment of content. So if a precisification *P* assigns a
place *x* to Bob's word 'there', Bob's utterance is true according to
that precisification iff *P* also assigns *x* to Alice's utterance of
'there'. That is, Bob's utterance is true according to *P* iff the
precisification of his words by *P* just is what Alice said *according
to P*.[^1]

It is a dramatic widening of the scope of precisifications to claim that
they assign content to every linguistic token in the world, rather than
just words in the sentence under consideration, but it can be
justified.[^2] Consider how we would react if later in the day, pointing
in the crucial direction, Alice said, 'Harold and I never danced the
rumba there.' We would think that Alice had contradicted herself -- that
between her two statements she must have said something false. A
standard supervaluationist account, where sentences are precisified one
at a time, cannot deliver this result. On such a view, it might be that
each of Alice's utterances are true on some precisifications, so they
are both neither true nor false. On my theory, each precisification
applies to both of Alice's utterances (as well as every other utterance
ever made) and since on each precisification one or other of the
utterances is false, it turns out supertrue that Alice said something
false, as desired. The current view allows for penumbral connections
between sentences, as well as penumbral connections within sentences.
Just as someone who says, "That is red and orange" says something false,
my theory decrees that someone who says, "That is red. That is orange,"
while pointing at the same thing says something false, even if the
object is in the vague area 'between' red and orange.

It is crucial for this response to work that on every precisification,
Alice and Bob's demonstratives are co--referential. It does not seem
like a particular expansion of supervaluational theory to posit this as
a penumbral connection between the two words. At least, it seems
plausible enough to do this if Alice and Bob really are pointing in a
similar direction. If their demonstrations are only *roughly*
co-directional, then on some precisifications they may well pick out
different objects. This will definitely happen if some admissible
precisification of Alice's 'there' is not an admissible precisification
of Bob's 'there'. In such a case, the theory here predicts that Bob's
utterance will be indeterminate in truth value. But if Alice and Bob
only vaguely pointed in the same direction this is the correct
prediction.

### Natural Properties

Schiffer's problem seems to have been solved with a minimum of fuss, but
there is still a little work to do. Above I posited a penumbral
connection between Alice's and Bob's words without *explaining* how such
a connection could arise. This connection can be explained by some
general considerations about content, considerations closely tied to the
view of vagueness as semantic indecision that provides the best
motivation for supervaluationism. As a few writers have pointed out
[@Quine1960; @Putnam1980; @Kripke1982], there is not enough in our
dispositions to use words to fix a precise content all terms in our
lexicon. This does not immediately imply a thorough-going content
scepticism because, as a few writers have also pointed out
[@Putnam1973; @Kripke1980; @Lewis1983e; @Lewis1984a], meanings ain't
(entirely) in the head. Sometimes our words refer to a particular
property or object rather than another not because our dispositions make
this so, but because of some particular feature of that property or
object. David Lewis calls this extra feature 'naturalness': some
properties and objects are more natural than others, and when our verbal
dispositions do not discriminate between different possible contents,
naturalness steps in to finish the job and the more natural property or
object gets to be the content.

Well, that's what happens when things go well. Vagueness happens when
things don't go well. Sometimes our verbal dispositions are
indiscriminate between several different contents, and no one of these
is more natural than all the rest. In these cases there will be many
unnatural contents not eliminated by our dispositions that naturalness
does manage to eliminate, but there will be still be many contents left
uneliminated. Consider, for example, all the possible properties we
*might* denote by 'tall woman'. As far as our usage dispositions go, it
might denote any one of the following properties: woman taller than
1680mm, woman taller than 1681mm, woman taller than 1680.719mm, *etc*.
And it does not seem that any of these properties are more natural than
any other. Hence there is no precise fact about what the phrase denotes.
Hence it is vague. In sum, our dispositions are never enough to settle
the content of a term. In some cases, such as 'water', 'rabbit', 'plus',
'brain' and 'vat', nature is kind enough to, more or less, finish the
job. In others it is not, and vagueness is the result.

(The above reasoning has a surprising consequence. Perhaps our verbal
dispositions are consistent with the predicate *Tall X* denoting the
property of being in the top quartile of *X*s by height. Unlike each of
the properties mentioned in the text, this is a more natural property
than many of its competitors. So if this kind of approach to vagueness
is right, there *might* not be quite as much vagueness as we expected.)

If this is how vagueness is created, then there is a natural way to
understand how precisifications remove vagueness. Vagueness arises
because *more natural than* is a partial order on putative contents, and
hence there might be no most natural content consistent with our verbal
dispositions. If this relation only defined a strict ordering, so
whatever the candidate meanings were, one of them would be most natural,
vagueness might be defeated. Well, that isn't true in reality, but it is
true on each precisification. Every precisification is a completion of
the 'naturalness' partial order. That is, each precisification *P*
defines a strict order, *more natural-P than*, on possible contents of
terms such that *o*~1~ is more natural-*P* than *o*~2~ if (but not only
if) *o*~1~ is more natural than *o*~2~. The particular contents of terms
according to *P* is then defined by using the more natural-*P* than
relation where the more natural than relation is used in the real theory
of content.

This conjecture meshes nicely with my theory of the role of
precisifications. First, it explains why precisifications apply to the
whole of language. Since a precisification does not just remedy a defect
in a particular word, but a defect in the content generation mechanism,
precisifications are most naturally applied not just to a single word,
but to every contentful entity. Secondly, it explains why we have the
particular penumbral connections we actually have. Recall that it was
left a little unexplained above why Alice's and Bob's use of 'there'
denoted the same precise place. On the current conjecture, Alice's term
refers to a particular place *x* according to *P* because *x* is more
natural--*P* than all the other places to which Alice might have
referred. If this is so, then *x* will be more natural--*P* than all the
other places to which Bob might have referred, so it will also be the
referent according to *P* of Bob's there. Hence according to every
precisification, Bob's utterance will be true, as Schiffer required.

We can also explain some other unexplained penumbral connections by
appeal to naturalness. Consider the sentence *David Chalmers is
conscious*. Unless this is supertrue, supervaluationism is in trouble.
It is vague just which object is denoted by *David Chalmers*. On every
precisification, there are other objects that massively overlap David
Chalmers. Indeed, these very objects are denoted by 'David Chalmers' on
other precisifications. These objects are not conscious, since if one
did there would be two conscious objects where, intuitively, there is
just one. But each of these rogue objects must be in the extension of
'conscious' on the precisifications where it is the denotation of 'David
Chalmers'. So 'conscious' must be vague in slightly unexpected ways, and
there must be a penumbral connection between it and 'David Chalmers': on
every precisification, whatever object is denoted by that name is in the
extension of 'conscious', while no other potential denotata of 'David
Chalmers' is in the extension. How is this penumbral connection to be
explained? Not by appeal to the meanings of the terms! Even if 'David
Chalmers' has descriptive content, it is highly implausible that this
includes *being conscious*. (After all, unless medicine improves a bit
in a thousand years Chalmers will not be conscious.) Rather, this
penumbral connection is explained by the fact that the very same thing,
naturalness, is used in resolving the vagueness in the terms 'conscious'
and 'David Chalmers'. If the precisification makes one particular
possible precisification of 'David Chalmers', say *d*~1~, more natural
than another, *d*~2~, then it will make properties satisfied by *d*~1­~
more natural than those satisfied by *d*~2~, so every precisification
will make the denotation of 'David Chalmers' fall into the extension of
'conscious'.

We can say the same thing about Alice's original statement: *That is
where Harold and I first danced the rumba.* Since one can't *first*
dance the rumba with Harold in two different places, it seems Alice's
statement can't be true relative to more than one precisification of
'That'. But really the phrase after 'is' is also vague, and there is a
penumbral connection (via naturalness) between it and the demonstrative.
Hence we can say Alice's statement is supertrue without appealing to any
*mysterious* penumbral connections.

### McGee and McLaughlin's Challenge

Vann McGee and Brian McLaughlin [-@McGee2000] raise a challenge for
supervlauational approaches to the Problem of the Many that uses belief
reports in much the way that Schiffer's problem uses speech reports.
They fear that without further development, the supervaluational theory
cannot distinguish between the *de re* and *de dicto* readings of (4).

1.  Ralph believes that there is a snow-capped mountain within sight of
    the equator.

They claim, correctly, that (4) should have both a *de dicto* reading
and a *de re* reading, where in the latter case it is a belief about
Kilimanjaro. The problem with the latter case is unclear how Ralph's
belief can be about Kilimanjaro itself. To press the point, they
consider an atom at or around the base of Kilimanjaro, called Sparky,
and define "Kilimanjaro(+) to be the body of land constituted ... by the
atoms that make up Kilimanjaro together with Sparky [and]
Kilimanjaro(-) [to] be the body of land constituted ... by the atoms
that make up Kilimanjaro other than Sparky." (129) The problem with
taking (4) to be true on a *de re* reading is that "there isn't
anything, either in his mental state or in his neural state or in his
causal relations with his environment that would make one of
Kilimanjaro(+) and Kilimanjaro(-), rather than the other, the thing that
Ralph's belief is about." (146) So if the truth of (4) on a *de re*
reading requires that Ralph believes a singular, or object-dependent,
proposition, about one of Kilimanjaro(+) and Kilimanjaro(-), then (4)
cannot be true. Even worse, if the truth of (4) requires that Ralph both
that Ralph believes a singular proposition about Kilimanjaro(+), that it
is a snow-capped mountain within sight of the equator, and the same
proposition about Kilimanjaro(-), then given some knowledge about
mountains on Ralph's part, (4) cannot be true, because that would
require Ralph to mistakenly believe there are two mountains located
roughly where Kilimanjaro is located.

We should not be so easily dissuaded. It is hard to identify exactly
which features of Ralph's "mental state or neural state or causal
relations with his environment" that make it the case that he believes
that two plus two equals four, but does not believe that two quus two
equals four. (I assume Ralph is no philosopher, so lacks the concept
QUUS.) I doubt, for example, that the concept PLUS has some causal
influence over Ralph that the concept QUUS lacks. But Ralph does have
the belief involving PLUS, and not the belief involving QUUS. He has
this belief not merely in virtue of his mental or neural states, or his
causal interactions with his environment, but in virtue of the fact that
PLUS is a more natural concept than QUUS, and hence is more eligible to
be a constituent of his belief.

So if Kilimanjaro(+) is more natural than Kilimanjaro(-), it will be a
constituent of Ralph's belief, despite the fact that there is no other
reason to say his belief is about one rather than the other. Now, in
reality Kilimanjaro(+) is no more natural than Kilimanjaro(-). But
according to any precisification, one of them will be more natural than
the other, for precisifications determine content by determining
relative naturalness. Hence if Ralph has a belief with the right
structure, in particular a belief with a place for an object (roughly,
Kilimanjaro) and the property *being within sight of the equator*, then
on every precisification he has a singular belief that a
Kilimanjaro-like mountain is within sight of the equator. And notice
that since naturalness determines both mental content and verbal
content, on every precisification the constituent of that belief will be
the referent of 'Kilimanjaro'. So even on a *de re* reading, (4) will be
true.

Schiffer's problem showed that we should not take precisifications to be
defined merely over single sentences. McGee and McLaughlin's problem
shows that we should take precisifications to set the content not just
of sentences, but of mental states as well. Precisifications do not just
assign precise content to every contentful linguistic token, but to
every contentful entity in the world, including beliefs. This makes the
issue of penumbral connections that we discussed in section two rather
pressing. We already noted the need to establish penumbral connections
between separate uses of demonstratives. Now we must establish penumbral
connections between words and beliefs. The idea that precisifications
determine content by determining relative naturalness establishes these
connections.

To sum up, McGee and McLaughlin raise three related problems concerning
*de re* belief. Two of these concern belief reports. First, how can we
distinguish between *de re* and *de dicto* reports? If I am right, we
can distinguish between these just the way Russell suggested, by
specifying the scope of the quantifiers. McGee and McLaughlin suspect
this will not work because in general we cannot argue from (5) to (6),
given the vagueness of 'Kilimanjaro'.

1.  Kilimanjaro is such that Ralph believes it to be within sight of the
    equator.

2.  There is a mountain such that Ralph believes it to be within sight
    of the equator.

Whether or not we want to accept a semantics in which we must restrict
existential generalisation in this way as a general rule, we can give an
independent argument that (6) is true whenever (4) is true on a *de re*
reading (i.e. whenever (5) is true). The argument is just that on every
precisification, the subject of Ralph's salient singular belief is a
mountain, so (6) is true on every precisification. This argument assumes
that there is a penumbral connection between the subject of this belief,
as we might say the referent of 'Kilimanjaro' in his language of
thought[^3], and the word 'mountain'. But since we have already
established that there is such a connection between 'Kilimanjaro' in his
language of thought and 'Kilimanjaro' in public language, and there is
obviously a connection between 'Kilimanjaro' in public language and the
word 'mountain', as 'Kilimanjaro is a mountain' is supertrue, this
assumption is safe. So the second puzzle McGee and McLaughlin raise, how
it can be that the relevant *de re* reports can be *true*, has also been
addressed.

There is a third puzzle McGee and McLaughlin raise that the reader might
think I have not addressed. How can it be that Ralph can actually have a
*de re* belief concerning Kilimanjaro? I have so far concentrated on
belief reports, not merely on beliefs, and my theory has relied
crucially on correlations between the vagueness in these reports and the
vagueness in the underlying belief. It might be thought that I have
excluded the most interesting case, the one where Ralph has a particular
belief with Kilimanjaro itself as a constituent. While I will end up
denying Ralph can have such a belief, I doubt this a problematic feature
of my view. The theory outlined here denies that Ralph has
object--dependent beliefs, but not that he has *de re* beliefs. I deny
that Ralph has a belief that has Kilimanjaro(+) as a constituent, but it
is hard to see how Ralph *could* have such a belief, since it very hard
to see how he could have had a belief that has Kilimanjaro(+) rather
than Kilimanjaro(-) as its subject. (This was McGee and McLaughlin's
fundamental point.) If we think that having a *de re* belief implies
having a belief whose content is an object--dependent proposition, then
we must deny that there are *de re* beliefs about Kilimanjaro. Since
there is no object that is determinately a constituent of the
proposition Ralph believes, it is a little hard to maintain that he
believes an object--dependent proposition.[^4] But this is not the only
way to make sense of *de re* beliefs.

Robin Jeshion has argued that whether a belief is *de re* depends
essentially on its role in cognition. "What distinguishes *de re*
thought is its structural or organisational role in thought"
[@Jeshion2002 67][^5] I won't rehearse Jeshion's arguments here, just
their more interesting conclusions. We can have *de re* beliefs about an
object iff we have a certain kind of mental file folder for the object.
This folder need not be generated by acquaintance with the object, so
acquiantanceless *de re* belief is possible. Indeed, the folder could
have been created defectively, so there is no object that the
information in the folder is about.[^6] In this case, the contents of
the folder are subjectless *de re* beliefs. Jeshion doesn't discuss
this, but presumably the folder must not have been created purely to be
the repository for information about the bearer of a certain property,
whoever or whatever that is. We have to rule out this option if we
follow @Szabo2000 in thinking the folder metaphor plays a crucial role
in explaining our talk and thought involving descriptions. Provided the
folder was created with the intent that it record information about some
object, rather than merely information about whatever object has a
particular property, its contents are *de re* beliefs. (To allow for
distinct folders 'about' non-existent objects, we must allow that it is
possible that such folders *do* have their reference fixed by their
contents, but as long as this was not the intent in creation these
folders can suffice for *de re* belief. This point lets us distinguish
between my folder for *Vulcan* and my folder for *The planet causing the
perturbations of Mercury*. Both are individuated by the fact that they
contain the proposition *This* *causes the perturbations of Mercury*. It
is this feature of the folder that fixes their reference, or in this
case their non-reference. Only in the latter case, however, was this the
intent in creating the folder, so its contents are *de dicto* beliefs,
while the contents of the former are *de re* beliefs.)

Now we have the resources to show how Ralph can have *de re* beliefs
concerning Kilimanjaro. When Ralph hears about it, or sees it, he opens
a file folder for Kilimanjaro. This is not intended to merely be a
folder for the mountain he just heard about, or saw. It is intended to
be a folder for *that*. (Imagine here that I am demonstrating the
mountain in question.) The Kripkenstein point about referential
indeterminacy applies to folders as much as to words. This point is
closely related to Kripke's insistence that his indeterminacy argument
does not rely on behaviourism. So if Ralph's folder is to have a
reference, it must be fixed in part by the naturalness of various
putative referents. But that is consistent with Ralph's folder
containing *de re* beliefs, since unless Ralph is a certain odd kind of
philosopher, he will not have in his folder that Kilimanjaro is
peculiarly eligible to be a referent. So the referent of the folder is
not fixed by its contents (as the referent for a folder about *The
mountain over there, whatever it is*, would be, or how the referent for
a folder about *The natural object over there, whatever it is*, would
be), and the contents of this folder are still *de re* beliefs Ralph has
about Kilimanjaro. This was a bit roundabout, but we have seen that the
Problem of the Many threatens neither the possibility that Ralph is the
subject of true *de re* belief ascriptions, nor that he actually has *de
re* beliefs.

### Vague Objects

> "I think the principle that to be is to be determinate is *a priori*,
> and hence that it is *a priori* that there is no *de re* vagueness".
> [@Jackson2001 657-658]

So do I. I also think there are a few arguments for this claim, though
some of them may seem question-begging to the determined defender of
indeterminate objects. Most of these arguments I will just mention,
since I assume the reader has little desire to see them detailed
*again*. One argument is just that it is obvious that there is no *de
re* vagueness. Such 'arguments' are not worthless. The best argument
that there are no true contradictions is of just this form, as
@Priest1998 shows. And it's a good argument! Secondly, Russell's point
that *most* arguments for *de re* vagueness involve confusing what is
represented with its representation still seems fair [@Russell1923].
Thirdly, even though the literature on this is a rather large, it still
looks like the Evans-Salmon argument against vague identities works, at
least under the interpretation David Lewis gives it, and this makes it
hard to see how there could be vague objects
[@Evans1978; @Salmon1981; @Lewis1988g]. Fourthly, Mark @Heller1996
argues that we have to allow that referential terms are semantically
vague. He says we have to do so to explain context dependence but there
are a few other explanatory projects that would do just as well. Since
semantic conceptions of vagueness can explain all the data that are
commonly taken to support ontological vagueness, it seems theoretically
unparsimonious to postulate ontological vagueness too. That's probably
enough, but let me add one more argument to the mix. Accepting that
Kilimanjaro is be a vague material object distinct from both
Kilimanjaro(+) and Kilimanjaro(-) has either metaphysical or logical
costs. To prove this, I derive some rather unpleasant metaphysical
conclusions from the assumption that Kilimanjaro is vague. The proofs
will use some contentious principles of classical logic, but rejecting
those, and hence rejecting classical logic, would be a substantial
logical cost. The most contentious such principle used will be an
instance of excluded middle: Sparky is or is not a part of Kilimanjaro.
I also assume that if for all *x* other than Sparky that *x* is a part
of *y* iff it is a part of *z*, then if Sparky is part of both *y* and
*z*, or part of neither *y* nor *z*, then *y* and *z* coincide. If
someone can contrive a mereological theory that rejects this principle,
it will be immune to these arguments.

It is very plausible that material objects are individuated by the
materials from which they are composed, so any coincident material
objects are identical. Properly understood, that is a good account of
what it is to be material. The problem is getting a proper
understanding. @Sider1996-SIDATW interprets it as saying that no two
non-identical material objects coincide *right now*. His project ends up
running aground over concerns about sentences involving counting, but
his project, of finding a strong interpretation of the principle is
intuitively compelling. David [@Lewis1986a Ch. 4] defends a slight
weaker version: no two non-identical material objects coincide *at all
times*. Call this the *strong composition principle* (scp). The scp is
(classically) inconsistent with the hypothesis that Kilimanjaro is
vague. If Sparky is part of Kilimanjaro, then Kilimanjaro and
Kilimanjaro(+) always coincide. If Sparky is not part of Kilimanjaro
then Kilimanjaro and Kilimanjaro(-) always coincide. Either way, two
non-identical objects always coincide, which the scp does not allow.

Some think the scp is refuted by Gibbard's example of Lumpl and Goliath
[@Gibbard1975]. The most natural response to Gibbard's example is to
weaken our individuation principle again, this time to: no two
non-identical material objects coincide *in all worlds* *at all times*.
Call this the *weak compositional principle* (wcp). Since there are
worlds in which Goliath is composed of bronze, but Lumpl is still a lump
of clay in those worlds, Lumpl and Goliath do not refute the wcp. Some
may think that even the wcp is too strong[^7], but most would agree that
if vague objects violated the wcp, that would be a reason to believe
they don't exist.

Given a plausible metaphysical principle, which I call Crossover, vague
objects will violate the wcp. As shown above, Kilimanjaro actually
(always) coincides with Kilimanjaro(+) or Kilimanjaro(-), but is not
identical with either. Crossover is the following principle:

Crossover

:   For any actual material objects *x* and *y* there is an object *z*
    that coincides with *x* in the actual world and *y* in all other
    worlds.

Given that arbitrary fusions exist, Crossover is entailed by, but does
not entail, the doctrine of arbitrary modal parts: that for any object
*o* and world *w*, if *o* exists in *w* then *o* has a part that only
exists in *w*. But Crossover does not have the most surprising
consequence of the doctrine of arbitrary modal parts: that for any
object *o* there is an object that has essentially all the properties
*o* actually has.

Let K1 be the object that coincides with Kilimanjaro in this world and
Kilimanjaro(+) in all other worlds. Let K2 be the object that coincides
with Kilimanjaro in this world and Kilimanjaro(-) in all other worlds.
If Sparky is part of Kilimanjaro then K1 and Kilimanjaro(+) coincide in
all worlds, but they are not identical, since it is determinate that
Sparky is actually part of Kilimanjaro(+) and not determinate that it is
part of K1. If Sparky is not part of Kilimanjaro then K2 and
Kilimanjaro(-) coincide in all worlds, but they are not identical, since
it is determinate that Sparky is not actually part of Kilimanjaro(-) and
not determinate that it is not part of K2. Either way, we have a
violation of the wcp. So the following three claims are (classically)
inconsistent.

1.  Crossover.

2.  The wcp.

3.  Kilimanjaro is a vague object that indeterminately has Sparky as a
    part.

I think the first two are highly plausible, so accepting (c) is costly.
I already noted the plausibility of the wcp, so the focus should be on
Crossover. On Lewis's account of modality, it is clearly true, as is the
stronger doctrine of arbitrary modal parts. On a fictionalist theory of
modality based on Lewis's account, it is still true, or at least true in
the fiction that we must adopt to make sense of modal talk. So the
principle is not without merits. And dialectically, opposing Crossover
will be problematic for the believer in vague objects. Either an
object's modal profile is determined by its categorical properties or it
isn't. If it is, then the wcp will entail the scp, so by the above
reasoning vague objects will be inconsistent with the wcp. If it is not,
then it is hard to see why an object could not have a completely
arbitrary modal profile, say the profile of some other ordinary material
object. But that means Crossover is true, and again we cannot have both
the wcp and vague objects. Probably the best way out for the believer in
vague objects will be to short-circuit this reasoning by abandoning
classical logic, presumably by declining to endorse the version of
excluded middle with which I started. But that is undoubtedly a costly
move, particularly for a supervaluationist.

### McKinnon on Coins and Precisifications

Most of our discussions of the Problem of the Many relate to the
vagueness in a single singular term, and a single ordinary object. As
McKinnon reminds us, however, there is not just one mountain in the
world, there are many of them, and supervaluationists are obliged to say
plausible things about statements that are about many mountains. Or, to
focus on McKinnon's example, we must not only have a plausible theory of
coins, but of coin exhibitions. These do raise distinctive problems.
Imagine we have an exhibition with, as we would ordinarily say, 2547
coins, each numbered in the catalogue. So to each number *n* there
correspond millions of coin-like entities, coin\*s in Sider's helpful
phrase [@Sider2001], and each precisification assigns a coin\* to a
number. In general, Sider holds that something is an *F*\* iff it has
all the properties necessary and sufficient for being an *F* except the
property of not massively overlapping another *F*. There are some
interesting questions about how independent these assignments can be. If
one precisification assigns coin\* *c*~1~ to *n*~1~, and another assigns
coin\* *c*~2~ to *n*~2~ (distinct from *n*~1~) then is there a
guaranteed to be a precisification that assigns both *c*~1~ to *n*~1~
and *c*~2~ to *n*~2~? In other words, may the precisifications of each
numeral (construed as a coin denotation) be *independent* of each other?
The following example suggests not. Say *C~j~* is the set of coin\*s
that are possible precisifications of *j*. This set may be vague because
of higher--order vagueness, but set those difficulties aside. If every
member of *C*~1728~ has a duplicate in *C*~1729~, then presumably only
precisifications that assigned duplicates to '1728' and '1729' would be
admissible. If the exhibition has two Edward I pennies on display to
show the obverse and reverse, and miraculously these coins are
duplicates, such a situation will arise.

This case is fanciful, so we don't know whether in reality the
precisifications of the numerals are independent. We probably can't
answer this question, but this is no major concern. McKinnon has found a
question which the supervaluationist should feel a need to answer, but
to which neither answer seems appropriate. Say that a precisification is
*principled* iff there is some not-too-disjunctive property *F* such
that for each numeral *n*, the precisification assigns to *n* the
*F*-est coin\* in *C~n~*. If *F* does not come in degrees, then the
precisification assigns to *n* the *F* in *C~n~*. McKinnon's question to
the supervaluationist is: Are all precisifications principled? He aims
to show either answering 'yes' or 'no' gets the supervaluationist in
trouble. 'Yes' leads to there being too few precisifications; 'No' leads
to there being too many. Let us look at these in order.

I have little to say for now on the first horn of this dilemma.
McKinnon's survey of principled precisifications only considers cases
where *F* is intrinsic, and I postpone for now investigation of
extrinsic principles. Nevertheless, he does show that if *F* must be
intrinsic, then there are not enough principled precisifications to
generate all the indeterminacy our coin exhibit intuitively displays.
The other horn is trickier.

A precisification must not only assign a plausible coin\* to each
numeral, it must do so in such a way that respects penumbral
connections. McKinnon thinks that unprincipled, or *arbitrary*
precisifications, will violate (NAD) and (NAS).

Non-Arbitrary Differences (NAD)

:   For any coin and non-coin, there is a principled difference between
    them which forms the basis for one being a coin and the other being
    a non-coin.

Non-Arbitrary Similarities (NAS)

:   For any pair of coins, there is a principled similarity between them
    which forms the basis for their both being coins.

McKinnon holds these are true, so they should be true on all
precisifications, but they are not true on unprincipled
precisifications, so unprincipled precisifications are unacceptable. The
motivation for (NAD) and (NAS) is clear. When we list the fundamental
properties of the universe, we will not include *being a coin*. Coinness
doesn't go that deep. So if some things are coins, they must be so in
virtue of their other properties. From this (NAD) and (NAS) follow.

The last step looks dubious. Consider any coin, for definiteness say the
referent of '1728', and a coin\* that massively overlaps it. The coin\*
is not a coin, so (a) one of these is a coin and the other is not, and
(b) the minute differences between them cannot form the basis for a
distinction between coins and non-coins. Hence (NAD) and (NAS) fail. At
best, it seems, we can justify the following claims. If something is a
coin\* and something else is not, *then* there is a principled
difference between them that makes one of them a coin\* and the other
not. Something is a coin iff it is a coin\* that does not excessively
overlap a coin. If this is the best we can do at defining 'coin', then
the prospects for a *reductive* physicalism about coins might look a
little dim, though this is no threat to a physicalism about coins that
stays neutral on the question of reduction. (I trust no reader is an
anti-physicalist about coins, but it is worth noting how vexing
questions of reduction can get even when questions of physicalism are
settled.)

So I think this example refutes (NAD) and (NAS). Do I beg some questions
here? Well, my counterexample turns crucially on the existence of kinds
of objects, massively overlapping coin\*s, that some people reject, and
indeed that some find the most objectionable aspect of the
supervaluationist solution. But this gets the burden of proof the wrong
way around. I was not trying to refute (NAD) and (NAS). I just aimed to
parry an argument based on those principles. I am allowed to appeal to
aspects of my theory in doing so without begging questions. I do not
want to rest too much weight on this point, however, for issues to do
with who bears the burden of proof are rarely easily resolved, so let us
move on.

My main response to McKinnon's dilemma is another dilemma. If the
principled similarities and differences in (NAD) and (NAS) must be
intrinsic properties, then those principles are false, because there is
no principled intrinsic difference between a coin and a token, or a coin
and a medal. If the principled similarities and differences in (NAD) and
(NAS) may be extrinsic properties, then those principles may be true,
but then the argument that there are not enough principled
precisifications fail, since now we must consider precisifications based
on extrinsic principles. Let's look at the two halves of that dilemma in
detail, in order.

A subway token is not a coin. Nor is a medal.[^8] But in their intrinsic
respects, subway tokens often resemble certain coins more than some
coins resemble other coins. Imagine we had a Boston subway token (which
looks a bit like an American penny, but larger), an American penny, a
British 20p piece (which is roughly heptagonal) and an early Australian
holey dollar (which has a hole in it). There is no non-disjunctive
classification of these by intrinsic properties that includes the penny,
the 20p piece and the holey dollar in one group, and the subway token in
the other. Any group that includes the penny and the other coins will
include the token as well. So if we restrict attention to intrinsic
similarities and differences, (NAD) and (NAS) are false.

There is a difference between these coins and the subway token. The
coins were produced with the intent of being legal tender, the token was
not. Perhaps we can find a difference between coins and non-coins based
on the intent of their creator.[^9] This might make (NAD) and (NAS)
true. But note that given the theory of precisifications developed in
section 3, on every precisification, one and only one of the
precisifications of '1728' will be the subject of an intention on the
part of its manufacturer. Just which of the objects is the subject of
this intent will vary from precisification to precisification, but there
is only one on every precisification. So we can say that on every
precisification, *the* coin is the one where the intent of its creator
was that it be used in a certain way. Indeed, on any precisification we
may have antecedently thought to have existed, we can show that
precisification to be principled by taking *F* to be the property *being
created with intent of being used in a coin-like way*.[^10] So now we
can say that restricting attention to the principled precisifications
does not unduly delimit the class of precisifications.

Let's sum up. To argue against the possibility of unprincipled
precisifications, McKinnon needed to justify (NAD) and (NAS). But these
are only true when we allow 'principled differences' to include
differences in creatorial intent. And if we do that we can see that
every *prima facie* admissible precisification is principled, so we can
give an affirmative answer to McKinnon's question.

It might be objected that this move relies heavily on the fact that for
many artefacts creative intent is constitutive of being the kind of
thing that it is. But a Problem of the Many does not arise only for
artefacts, so my solution does not generalise. This is little reason for
concern since McKinnon's problem does not generalise either. (NAD) and
(NAS) are clearly false when we substitute 'mountain' for 'coin'.
Consider a fairly typical case where it is indeterminate whether we have
one mountain or two.[^11] In this case it might be not clear whether,
for example, we have one mountain with a southern and a northern peak,
or two mountains, one of them a little north of the other. Whether there
is one mountain here or two, clearly the two peaks exist, and their
fusion exists too. The real question is which of these three things is a
mountain. However this question is resolved, a substitution instance of
(NAD) with the two objects being the southern peak and the fusion of the
two peaks will be false. So in this case a relatively unprincipled
precisification will be acceptable. The point here is that mountain\*s
that are not mountains exist (either the peaks or their fusion will do
as examples), and that suffices to refute McKinnon's alleged penumbral
connections and allow, in this case, a negative answer to his question.

### Sorensen on Direct Reference

According to orthodoxy, we can use descriptions to determine the
reference of names without those descriptions becoming part of the
meaning of the name. This, apparently, is what happened when Leverrier
introduced 'Neptune' to *name*, not merely describe, the planet causing
certain perturbations, and when someone introduced 'Jack the Ripper' to
*name*, not merely describe, the person performing certain murders. So
let us introduce 'Acme' as the name for the first tributary of the river
Enigma. As Sorensen suggests, this can create certain problems.

> When [explorers] first travel up the river Enigma they finally reach
> the first pair of river branches. They name one branch 'Sumo' and the
> other 'Wilt'. Sumo is shorter but more voluminous than Wilt. This
> makes Sumo and Wilt borderline cases of 'tributary' ... 'Acme'
> definitely refers to something, even though it is vague whether it
> refers to Sumo and vague whether it refers to Wilt. [@Sorensen2000
> 180]

If 'Acme', 'Sumo' and 'Wilt' are all vague names related in this way,
Sorensen thinks the supervaluationist has a problem. The sentences 'Acme
is Sumo' and 'Acme is Wilt' both express propositions of the form
$\langle x = y \rangle$. For exactly one of them, *x* is *y*. Since the
proposition contains just the objects *x* and *y* (and the identity
relation) but not their route into the proposition, there is no
vagueness in the proposition. Hence there is no way to precisify either
proposition. So a supervaluationist cannot explain how these
propositions are vague.

This is no problem for supervaluationism, since supervaluationism says
that *sentences*, not *propositions*, are vague. Indeed, most
supervaluationists would say that no proposition is ever vague. Thinking
they are vague is just another instance of the fallacy Russell
identified: attributing properties of the representation to the entity,
in this case a proposition, represented.

But maybe there is a problem in the area. One natural way of spelling
out the idea that names directly refer to objects is to say that the
*meaning* of a name is its referent. And one quite plausible principle
about precisifications is that precisifications must not *change* the
meaning of a term, they may merely provide a meaning where none exists.
Now the supervaluationist has a problem. For it is true that one of
Sorensen's identity sentences is true in virtue of its meaning, since
its meaning determines that it expresses a proposition of the form
$\langle x = x \rangle$. But each sentence is false on some
precisifications, so some precisifications change the meaning of the
terms involved.

The best way to respond to this objection is simply to bite the bullet.
We can accept that some precisifications alter meanings provided we can
provide some other criteria for acceptability of precisifications. I
offered one such proposal in section 2. An acceptable precisification
takes the partial order *more natural than*, turns it into a complete
order without changing any of the relations that already exist, and uses
this new relation to generate meanings. If we proceed in this way it is
possible, for all we have hitherto said, that on every precisification
the proposition expressed by 'Acme is Sumo' will be of the form
$\langle x = y \rangle$, so just the named object, rather than the
method of naming, gets into the proposition. The central point is that
since precisifications apply to the processes that turn semantic
intentions into meanings, rather than to sentences with meanings, there
is no guarantee they will preserve meanings. But if we like directly
referential theories of names we should think this perfectly natural. If
names are directly referential then Sorensen's argument that there are
vague sentences that are true in virtue of their meaning works. But this
is consistent with supervaluationism.

One challenge remains. If precisifications change meanings, why should
we care about them, or about what is true on all of them? This is not a
new challenge; it is a central plank in Jerry Fodor and Ernest Lepore's
[-@Fodor1996] attack on supervaluationism. A simple response is just to
say that we should care about precisifications because this method
delivers the right results in all core cases, and an intuitively
plausible set of results in contentious cases. This kind of
instrumentalism about the foundations of a theory is not always
satisfying.[^12] But if that's the biggest problem supervaluationists
have, they should be able to sleep a lot easier than the rest of us.

### Conclusions and Confessions

I have spent a fair bit of time arguing that supervaluationism is not
vulnerable to a few challenges based on the Problem of the Many. Despite
doing all this, I don't believe supervaluationism to be quite true. So
why spend this time? Because the true theory of vagueness will be a
*classical semantic* theory, and everything I say about
supervaluationism above applies *mutatis mutandis* to all classical
semantic theories. I focussed on supervaluationism because it is more
familiar and more popular, but I need not have.

What is a classical semantic theory? That's easy - it's a theory that is
both classical and semantic. What is a classical theory? It is one that
incorporates vagueness while preserving classical logic. How much of
classical logic must we preserve? That's a hard question, though it is
relevant to determining whether supervaluationism is (as it is often
advertised) a classical theory. @Williamson1994-WILV notes that
supervaluationism does not preserve classical inference rules, and
@Hyde1997 notes that it does not preserve some classically valid
multiple--conclusion sequents. @Keefe2000 argues that neither of these
constitutes an important deviation from classical logic. I'm inclined to
disagree with Keefe on both points. Following Read (2000), I take it
that the best response to the anti-classical arguments in
@Dummett1991 takes the essential features of classical logic to be its
inferential rules as formulated in a multiple--conclusion logic. But we
need not adjudicate this dispute here. Why should we want a classical
theory? The usual arguments for it are based on epistemic conservatism,
and I think these arguments are fairly compelling. I also think that no
non--classical theory will be able to provide a plausible account of
quantification.[^13]

What is a semantic theory? It is one that makes vagueness a semantic
phenomenon. It is not necessarily one that makes vagueness a
*linguistic* phenomenon. That would be absurd in any case, since clearly
some non--linguistic entities, maps, beliefs and pictures for example,
are vague. But the more general idea that vagueness is a property only
of representations is quite attractive. It links up well with the theory
of content Lewis outlines in "Languages and Language" - all Languages
(in his technical sense) are precise, vagueness in natural language is a
result of indecision about which Language we are speaking.

Trenton @Merricks2001 argues against this picture, claiming that all
semantic vagueness (he says 'linguistic', but ignore that) must arise
because of metaphysical or epistemic vagueness. He claims that if (17)
is vague, then so is (18), and (18)'s vagueness must be either
metaphysical or semantic.

1.  Harry is bald.

2.  'Bald' describes Harry.

One might question the inference from (17)'s vagueness to (18) - on some
supervaluational theories if (17) is vague then (18) is false. But I
will let that pass, for there is a simpler problem in the argument.
Merricks claims that if (18) is vague, then it is vague whether 'Bald'
has the property *describing Harry*, and this is a kind of metaphysical
vagueness. It is hard to see how this follows. If there is metaphysical
vagueness, there is presumably some object *o* and some property *F*
such that it is vague whether the object has the property. Presumably
the object here is the word 'bald' and the property is *describing
Harry*. But words alone do not have properties like *describing Harry*.
At best, words in languages do so. So maybe the object can be the
ordered pair $\langle \text{`Bald'}, l \rangle$, where *l* is a
language. But which one? Not one of Lewis's Languages, for then it is
determinate whether \<'Bald', *l*\> has the property *describing Harry*.
So maybe a natural language, perhaps English! But it is doubly unclear
that English is an object. First, it is unclear whether we should reify
natural languages to such a degree that we accept that 'English' refers
to anything at all. Secondly, if we say 'English' does refer, why not
say that it refers to one of Lewis's Languages, thought it is vague
which one? That way we can say that the sentence *'Bald' in English
describes Harry* is vague without there being any object that vaguely
instantiates a property. Now on a supervaluational theory this approach
may have the unwanted consequence that "English is a precise language"
is true, since it is true on all precisifications. It does not seem that
*this* problem for the supervaluationist generalises to be a problem for
all semantic theories of vagueness, so Merricks has raised no general
problem for semantic theories of vagueness. (The problem for the
supervaluationist here is not new. For some discussion see Lewis's
response, in "Many, but Almost One" to the objection, there attributed
to Kripke, that the supervaluationist account makes it true that all
words are precise.)

If we have a classical semantic theory that provides a concept of
determinateness, then we can define acceptable precisifications as
maximal consistent extensions of the set of determinate truths. Given
that, it follows pretty quickly that determinate truth implies truth on
all precisifications. And this is sufficient for the major objections
canvassed above to get a foothold, and hence be worthy of response,
though as we have seen none of them will ultimately succeed. Still, our
theory may differ from supervaluationism in many ways. For one thing, it
might *explain* determinateness in ways quite different from those in
supervaluationism. For example, the theory in @Field2000 is a classical
semantic theory[^14], but it clearly goes beyond supervaluational theory
because it has an interesting, if ultimately flawed, explanation of
determinateness in terms of Shafer functions. Other classical semantic
theories may differ from supervaluationism by providing distinctive
theories of higher order vagueness.

The most promising research programs in vagueness are within the
classical semantic framework. Like all research programs, these programs
need a defensive component, to fend off potential refutations and
crisis. This avoids unwanted crises in the program, and as we have seen
here we can learn a bit from seeing how to defend against certain
attacks. There will undoubtedly be more challenges in the time ahead,
but for now the moves in this paper brings the defensive side of the
program up to date.

[^1]: Following Schiffer, we ignore the vagueness in 'is where Harold
    and I first danced the rumba.' This phrase is vague, but its
    vagueness raises no extra issues of philosophical importance.

[^2]: Thanks to John Hawthorne for the following argument.

[^3]: I do not mean here to commit myself to anything like the language
    of thought hypothesis. This is just being used as a convenient
    shorthand.

[^4]: This is hard, but not perhaps impossible. One might say that on
    every precisification, Ralph believes a proposition that has a
    mountain as a constituent, and hence as an essential part.

[^5]: I don't know if Jeshion would accept the corollary that if belief
    is too unstructured to allow for the possibility of such
    organisational roles, then there is no *de re* belief, but I do.

[^6]: Which is not just to say that there is no object that has all the
    properties in the folder. This is neither necessary nor sufficient
    for the folder to be about the object, as Kripke's discussion of
    'famous deeds' descriptivism should make clear.

[^7]: Kit @Fine1994 does exactly this.

[^8]: Some people I have asked think tokens are coins, but no one thinks
    medals are coins, so if you (mistakenly) think tokens are coins,
    imagine all my subsequent arguments are phrased using medals rather
    than tokens.

[^9]: Note that I say little here about what the intent of the creator
    must be. I don't think that the intent must always be to create
    legal tender. A ceremonial coin that is created, for example, to be
    tossed before the start of a sporting match is still a coin,
    although it is not intended to be tender. But intent still matters.
    If someone had made a duplicate of that ceremonial coin with the
    intent of awarding it as a medal to the victorious captain, it would
    be a medal and not a coin.

[^10]: Because of the problems raised in the previous footnote, I will
    not try and say just what this intention amounts to. There are
    complications when (a) the creator is a corporate entity rather than
    an individual and (b) the coins are mass--produced rather than
    produced individually. But since the story is essentially the same,
    I leave the gruesome details out here.

[^11]: This case is rather important in the history of the problem,
    because its discussion in @Quine1960 is one of the earliest
    presentations in print of anything like the problem of the many.

[^12]: The largest debate in the history of philosophy of economics
    concerned whether we could, or should, be instrumentalists about the
    ideally rational agents at the core of mainstream microeconomic
    theory. See @Friedman1953 for the classic statement of the
    instrumentalist position, and @Hausman1992 for the most amusing and
    enlightening of the countably many responses.

[^13]: See the last section of @Weatherson2005-WEATTT for a detailed
    defence of this claim.

[^14]: At least, it strikes me as a classical semantic theory. Ryan
    Wasserman has tried to convince me that properly understood, it is
    really an epistemic theory. Space prevents a thorough account of why
    I think Field's theory is flawed. Briefly, I think the point in
    @Leeds2000 that Field's concept of a numerical degree of belief
    needs *substantially* more explanation than Field gives it can be
    developed into a conclusive refutation.
