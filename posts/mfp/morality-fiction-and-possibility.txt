title: "Morality, Fiction and Possibility"
description: |
  Authors have a lot of leeway with regard to what they can make true in their story. In general, if the author says that p is true in the fiction we're reading, we believe that p is true in that fiction. And if we're playing along with the fictional game, we imagine that, along with everything else in the story, p is true. But there are exceptions to these general principles. Many authors, most notably Kendall Walton and Tamar Szabó Gendler, have discussed apparent counterexamples when p is "morally deviant". Many other statements that are conceptually impossible also seem to be counterexamples. In this paper I do four things. I survey the range of counterexamples, or at least putative counterexamples, to the principles. Then I look to explanations of the counterexamples. I argue, following Gendler, that the explanation cannot simply be that morally deviant claims are impossible. I argue that the distinctive attitudes we have towards moral propositions cannot explain the counterexamples, since some of the examples don't involve moral concepts. And I put forward a proposed explanation that turns on the role of 'higher-level concepts', concepts that if they are satisfied are satisfied in virtue of more fundamental facts about the world, in fiction, and in imagination.

# Four Puzzles

Several things go wrong in the following story.

</aside>

The last sentence raises a few related puzzles. Intuitively, it is not
true, even in the story, that Craig's murder was morally justified. What
the narrator tells us here is just false. That should be a little
surprising. We're being told a story, after all, so the storyteller
should be an authority on what's true in it. Here we hearers get to rule
on which moral claims are true and false, not the author. But usually
the author gets to say what's what. The action takes place in
Providence, on Highway 95, just because the author says so. And we don't
reject those claims in the story just because no such murder has ever
taken place on Highway 95. False claims can generally be true in
stories. Normally, the author's say so is enough to make it so, at least
in the story, even if what is said is really false. The first puzzle,
the **alethic** puzzle, is why authorial authority breaks down in cases
like *Death on the Freeway*. Why can't the author just make sentences
like the last sentence in *Death* true in the story by saying they are
true? At this stage I won't try and give a more precise characterisation
of which features of *Death* lead to the break down of authorial
authority, for that will be at issue below.

<aside>
I've spoken to
    practically everyone I know about the issues here, and a full list
    of thanks for useful advice, suggestions, recommendations,
    criticisms, counterexamples and encouragement would double the size
    of the paper. If I thank philosophy departments rather than all the
    individuals in them it might cut the size a little, so thanks to the
    departments at Brown, UC Davis, Melbourne, MIT and Monash. Thanks
    also to Kendall Walton, Tamar Gendler and two referees for
    *Philosophers' Imprint*. The most useful assistance came from
    Wolfgang Schwarz and especially Tyler Doggett, without whose advice
    this could never have been written, and to George Wilson, who
    prevented me from (keeping on) making a serious error of
    over-generalisation.
</aside>

The second puzzle concerns the relation between fiction and imagination.
Following Kendall @Walton1990, it is common to construe fictional works
as invitations to imagine. The author requests, or suggests, that we
imagine a certain world. In *Death* we can follow along with the author
for most of the story. We can imagine an argument taking place in peak
hour on Highway 95. We can imagine this frustrating the other drivers.
And we can imagine one of those drivers retaliating with a loaded gun.
What we cannot, or at least do not, imagine is that this retaliation is
morally justified. There is a limit to our imaginative ability here. We
refuse, fairly systematically, to play along with the author here. Call
this the **imaginative** puzzle. Why don't we play along in cases like
*Death*? Again, I won't say *for now* which cases are like *Death*.

The third puzzle concerns the phenomenology of *Death* and stories like
it. The final sentence is striking, jarring in a way that the earlier
sentences are not. Presumably this is closely related to the earlier
puzzles, though I'll argue below that the cases that generate this
peculiar reaction are not identical with cases that generate alethic or
imaginative puzzles. So call this the **phenomenological** puzzle.

Finally, there is a puzzle that David @Hume1757 first noticed. Hume
suggested that artistic works that include morally deviant claims, moral
claims that wouldn't be true were the descriptive aspects of the story
true, are thereby aesthetically compromised. Why is this so? Call that
the **aesthetic** puzzle. I will have nothing to say about that puzzle
here, though hopefully what I have to say about the other puzzles will
assist in solving it.

I'm going to call sentences that raise the first three puzzles
**puzzling** sentences. Eventually I'll look at the small differences
between those three puzzles, but for now we'll focus on what they have
in common. The puzzles, especially the imaginative puzzle, have become
quite a focus of debate in recent years. The aesthetic puzzle is raised
by David @Hume1757, and is discussed by Kendall @Walton1994 and Richard
@Moran1995. Walton and Moran also discuss the imaginative and alethic
puzzles, and they are the focus of attention in recent work by Tamar
Szabó @Gendler2000, Gregory @Currie2002 and Stephen @Yablo2002. My
solution to the puzzles is best thought of as a development of some of
Walton's 'sketchy story' (to use his description). Gendler suggests one
way to develop Walton's views, and shows it leads to an unacceptable
solution, because it leads to mistaken predictions. I will argue that
there are more modest developments of Walton's views that don't lead to
so many predictions, and in particular don't lead to *mistaken*
predictions, but which still say enough to solve the puzzles.

# The Range of the Puzzles

As Walton and Yablo note, the puzzle does not only arise in connection
with thin moral concepts. But it has not been appreciated how widespread
the puzzle is, and getting a sense of this helps us narrow the range of
possible solutions.

Sentences in stories attributing **thick moral concepts** can be
puzzling. If my prose retelling of *Macbeth* included the line "Then the
cowardly Macduff called on the brave Macbeth to fight him face to face,"
the reader would not accept that in the story Macduff was a coward. If
my retelling of *Hamlet* frequently described the young prince as
decisive, the reader would struggle to go along with me imaginatively.
Try imagining Hamlet doing exactly what he does, and saying exactly what
he says, and thinking what he thinks, but always decisively. For an
actual example, it's easy to find the first line in Bob Dylan's *Ballad
of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest*, that the titular characters 'were the
best of friends' puzzling in the context of how Frankie Lee treats Judas
Priest later in the song. It isn't too surprising that the puzzle
extends to the thick moral concepts, and Walton at least doesn't even
regard these as a separate category.

More interestingly, any kind of **evaluative** sentence can be puzzling.
Walton and Yablo both discuss sentences attributing aesthetic
properties. [@Yablo2002 485] suggests that a story in which the author
talks about the sublime beauty of a monster truck rally, while
complaining about the lack of aesthetic value in sunsets, is in most
respects like our morally deviant story. The salient aesthetic claims
will be puzzling. Note that we *are* able to imagine a community that
prefers the sight of a 'blood bath death match of doom' (to use Yablo's
evocative description) to sunsets over Sydney Harbour and it could
certainly be true in a fiction that such attitudes were commonplace. But
that does not imply that those people could be *right* in thinking the
trucks are more beautiful. [@Walton1994 43-44] notes that sentences
describing jokes that are actually unfunny as being funny will be
puzzling. We get to decide what is funny, not the author.

Walton and Yablo's point here can be extended to **epistemic
evaluations**. Again it isn't too hard to find puzzling examples when we
look at attributions of rationality or irrationality.

> *Alien Robbery*\
> Sam saw his friend Lee Remnick rushing out of a bank carrying in one
> hand a large bag with money falling out of the top and in the other
> hand a sawn-off shotgun. Lee Remnick recognised Sam across the street
> and waved with her gun hand, which frightened Sam a little. Sam was a
> little shocked to see Lee do this, because despite a few childish
> pranks involving stolen cars, she'd been fairly law abiding. So Sam
> decided that it wasn't Lee, but really a shape-shifting alien that
> looked like Lee, that robbed the bank. Although shape-shifting aliens
> didn't exist, and until that moment Sam had no evidence that they did,
> this was a rational belief. False, but rational.

The last two sentences of *Alien Robbery* are fairly clearly puzzling.

So far all of our examples have involved normative concepts, so one
might think the solution to the puzzle will have something to do with
the distinctive nature of normative concepts, or with their distinctive
role in fiction. Indeed, Gendler's and Currie's solutions have just this
feature. But sentences that seem somewhat removed from the realm of the
normative can still be puzzling. (It is of course contentious just where
the normative/non-normative barrier lies. Most of the following cases
will be regarded as involving normative concepts by at least some
philosophers. But I think few people will hold that *all* of the
following cases involve normative concepts.)

Attributions of **mental states** can, in principle, be puzzling. If I
retell *Romeo and Juliet*, and in this say 'Although he believed he
loved Juliet, and acted as if he did, Romeo did not really love Juliet,
and actually wanted to humiliate her by getting her to betray her
family', that would I think be puzzling. This example is odd, because it
is not obviously *impossible* that Romeo could fail to love Juliet even
though he thought he loved her (people are mistaken about this kind of
thing all the time) and acted as if he did (especially if he was trying
to trick her). But given the full detail of the story, it is impossible
to imagine that Romeo thought he had the attitudes towards Juliet he is
traditionally thought to have, and he is mistaken about this.

Attributions of **content**, either mental content or linguistic
content, can be just as puzzling. The second and third sentences in this
story are impossible to imagine, and false even in the story.

> *Cats and Dogs*\
> Rhodisland is much like a part of the actual world, but with a
> surprising difference. Although they use the word 'cat' in all the
> circumstances when we would (i.e. when they want to say something
> about cats), and the word 'dog' in all the circumstances we would, in
> their language 'cat' means dog and 'dog' means cat. None of the
> Rhodislanders are aware of this, so they frequently say false things
> when asked about cats and dogs. Indeed, no one has ever known that
> their words had this meaning, and they would probably investigate just
> how this came to be in some detail, if they knew it were true.

A similar story can be told to demonstrate how claims about mental
content can be puzzling. Perhaps these cases still involve the
normative. Loving might be thought to entail special obligations and
@Kripke1982 has argued that content is normative. But we are clearly
moving away from the moral, narrowly construed.

Stephen Yablo recently suggested that certain **shape** predicates
generate imaginative resistance. These predicates are meant to be
special categories of a broader category that we'll discuss further
below. Here's Yablo's example.

> *Game Over*\
> They flopped down beneath the giant maple. One more item to find, and
> yet the game seemed lost. Hang on, Sally said. It's staring us in the
> face. This is a *maple* tree we're under. She grabbed a five-fingered
> leaf. Here was the oval they needed! They ran off to claim their
> prize. [@Yablo2002 485, title added]

There's a potential complication in this story in that one might think
that it's metaphysically impossible that *maple* trees have ovular
leaves. That's not what is meant to be resisted, and I don't think is
resisted. What is resisted is that maple leaves have their distinctive
five-fingered look, that the shape of the leaf Sally collects is like
*that* (imagine I demonstrate a maple leaf here) and that its shape be
an *oval*.

Fewer people may care about the next class of cases, or have clear
intuitions about them, but if one has firm **ontological** beliefs, then
deviant ontological claims can be puzzling. I'm a universalist about
mereology, at least with respect to ordinary concrete things, so I find
many of the claims in this story puzzling.

> *Wiggins' World*\
> The Hogwarts Express was a very special train. It had no parts at all.
> Although you'd be tempted to say that it had carriages, an engine,
> seats, wheels, windows and so on, it really was a mereological atom.
> And it certainly had no temporal parts - it wholly was wherever and
> whenever it was. Even more surprisingly, it did not enter into
> fusions, so when the Hogwarts Local was linked to it for the first few
> miles out of Kings Cross, there was no one object that carried all the
> students through north London.

I think that even in fictions any two concrete objects have a fusion. So
the Hogwarts Express and the Hogwarts Local have a fusion, and when it
is a connected object it is commonly called a train. I know how to
describe a situation where they have no fusion (I did so just above) but
I have no idea how to *imagine* it, or make it true in a story.

More generally, there are all sorts of puzzling sentences involving
claims about **constitution**. These I think are the best guide to a
solution to the puzzle.

> *A Quixotic Victory*\
> --What think you of my redecorating Sancho?\
> --It's rather sparse, said Sancho.\
> --Sparse. Indeed it is sparse. Just a television and an armchair.\
> --Where are they, Señor Quixote? asked Sancho. All I see are a knife
> and fork on the floor, about six feet from each other. A sparse
> apartment for a sparse mind. He said the last sentence under his
> breath so Quixote would not hear him.\
> --They might look like a knife and fork, but they are a television and
> an armchair, replied Quixote.\
> --They look just like the knife and fork I have in my pocket, said
> Sancho, and he moved as to put his knife and fork besides the objects
> on Quixote's floor.\
> --Please don't do that, said Quixote, for I may be unable to tell your
> knife and fork from my television and armchair.\
> --But if you can't tell them apart from a knife and fork, how could
> they be a television and an armchair?\
> --Do you really think *being a television* is an observational
> property? asked Quixote with a grin.\
> --Maybe not. OK then, how do you change the channels? asked Sancho.\
> --There's a remote.\
> --Where? Is it that floorboard?\
> --No, it's at the repair shop, admitted Quixote.\
> --I give up, said Sancho.\
>
> Sancho was right to give up. Despite their odd appearance, Quixote's
> items of furniture really were a television and an armchair. This was
> the first time in months Quixote had won an argument with Sancho.

Quixote is quite right that whether something is a television is not
determined entirely by how it looks. A television could be
indistinguishable from a non-television. Nonetheless, something
indistinguishable from a knife is not a television. Not in this world,
and not in the world of *Victory* either, whatever the author says. For
whether something is a television is determined at least *in part* by
how it looks, and while it is impossible to provide a non-circular
constraint on how a television may look, it may not look like a common
knife.

In general, if whether or not something is an *F* is determined in part
by 'lower-level' features, such as the shape and organisation of its
parts, and the story specifies that the lower-level features are
incompatible with the object being an *F*, it is not an *F* in the
fiction. Suitably generalised and qualified, I think this is the
explanation of all of the above categories. To understand better what
the generalisations and qualifications must be, we need to look at some
cases that aren't like *Death*, and some alternative explanations of
what is going on in *Death*.

Sentences that are **intentional errors** on the part of storytellers
are not puzzling in our sense. We will use real examples for the next
few pages, starting with the opening line of Joyce's most famous short
story.

> *The Dead*\
> Lily, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet.\
> [@Joyce1914 138]

It isn't true that Lily is *literally* run off her feet. She is run off
her feet by the incoming guests, and if you asked her she may well say
she was literally run off her feet, but this would reveal as much about
her lack of linguistic care as about her demanding routine. Is this a
case where the author loses authority over what's true in the story? No,
we are not meant to read the sentence as being true in the story, but
being a faithful report of what Lily (in the story) might say to
herself. In practice it's incredibly difficult to tell just when the
author intends a sentence to be true in the story, as opposed to being a
report of some character's view of what is true. (See @Holton1997 for an
illustration of the complications this can cause.) But since we are
operating in theory here, we will assume *that* problem solved. The
alethic puzzle only arises when it is clear that the author intends that
*p* is true in her story, but we think *p* is not true. The imaginative
puzzle only arises when the author invites us to imagine *p*, but we can
not, or at least do not. Since Joyce does not intend this sentence to be
true in *The Dead*, nor invites us to imagine it being true, neither
puzzle arises. What happens to the phenomenological puzzle in cases like
these is a little more interesting, and I'll return to that in .

Just as intentional errors are not puzzling, **careless errors** are not
puzzling. Writing a full length novel is a perilous business. Things can
go wrong. Words can be miswritten, mistyped or misprinted at several
different stages. Sometimes the errors are easily detectable, sometimes
they are not, especially when they concern names. In one of the drafts
of *Ulysses*, Joyce managed to write "Connolly Norman" in place of
"Conolly Norman". Had that draft being used for the canonical printing
of the work, it would be tempting to say that we had another alethic
puzzle. For the character named here is clearly the Superintendent of
the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum, and his name had no double-'n', so
in the story there is no double-'n' either.[^2]

Here we do have an instance where what is true in the story differs from
the what is written in the text. But this is not a particularly
*interesting* deviation. To avoid arcane discussions of typographical
errors, we will that in every case we possess an ideal version of the
text, and are comparing it with the author's intentions. Slip-ups that
would be detected by a careful proof-reader, whether they reveal an
unintended divergence between word and world, as here, or between
various parts of the text, as would happen if Dr Norman were not named
after a real person but had his name spelled differently in parts of the
text, will be ignored.[^3]

Note two ways in which the puzzles as I have stated them are narrower
than they first appear. First, I am only considering puzzles that arise
from a particular sentence in the story, intentionally presented in the
voice of an authoritative narrator. We could try and generalise, asking
why it is that we sometimes (but not always) question the moral claims
that are intended to be tacit in a work of fiction. For instance, we
might hold that for some Shakespearean plays there are moral
propositions that Shakespeare intended to be true in the play, but which
are not in fact true. Such cases are interesting, but to keep the
problem of manageable proportions I won't explicitly discuss them here.
(I believe the solution I offer here generalises to those cases, but I
won't defend that claim here.) Second, all the stories I have discussed
are either paragraph-long examples, or relatively detachable parts of
longer stories. For all I've said so far, the puzzle *may* be restricted
to such cases. In particular, it might be the case that a suitably
talented author could make it true in a story that killing people for
holding up traffic is morally praiseworthy, or that a television is
phenomenally and functionally indistinguishable from a knife. What we've
seen so far is just that an author cannot make these things true in a
story simply by saying they are true.[^4] I leave open the question of
whether a more subtle approach could make those things true in a
fiction. Similarly, I leave it open whether a more detailed invitation
to imagine that these things are true would be accepted. All we have
seen so far is that simple direct invitations to imagine these things
are rejected, and it feels like we could not accept them.

# An Impossible Solution

Here's a natural solution to the puzzles, one that you may have been
waiting for me to discuss. The alethic puzzle arises because only
propositions that are possibly true can be true in a story, or can be
imagined. The latter claim rests on the hypothesis that we can imagine
only what is possible, and that we resist imagining what is impossible.

This solution assumes that it is *impossible* that killing people for
holding up freeway traffic is the right thing to do. Given enough
background assumptions, that *is* plausible. It is plausible, that is,
that the moral facts supervene on the non-moral facts. And the
supervenience principle here is quite a strong one - in *every* possible
world where the descriptive facts are thus and so, the moral facts are
the same way.[^5] If we assume the relevant concept of impossibility is
truth in no possible worlds, we get the nice result that the moral
claims at the core of the problem could not possibly be true.

Several authors have discussed solutions around this area. Kendall
@Walton1994 can easily be read as endorsing this solution, though
Walton's discussion is rather tentative. Tamar Szabó Gendler rejects the
theory, but thinks it is the most natural idea, and spends much of her
paper arguing against this solution. As those authors, and Gregory
@Currie2002, note, the solution needs to be tidied up a little before it
will work for the phenomenological and imaginative puzzles. (It is less
clear whether the tidying matters to the alethic puzzle.) For one thing,
there is no felt asymmetry between a story containing, "Alex proved the
twin primes theorem," and one containing, "Alex found the largest pair
of twin primes," even though *one of them* is impossible. Since we don't
know which it is, the impossibility of the false one cannot help us
here. So the theory must be that it is believed impossibilities that
matter, for determining what we can imagine, not just any old
impossibilities. Presumably impossibilities that are not salient will
also not prevent imagination.

Even thus qualified, the solution still overgenerates, as Gendler noted.
There are stories that are not puzzling in any way that contain known
salient impossibilities. Gendler suggests three kinds of cases of this
kind, of which I think only the third *clearly* works. The first kind of
case is where we have direct contradictions true in the story. Gendler
suggests that her *Tower of Goldbach* story, where seven plus five both
does and does not equal twelve, is not puzzling. Graham @Priest1999
makes a similar point with a story, *Sylvan's Box*, involving an empty
box with a small statue in one corner. These are clear cases of known,
salient impossibility, but arguably are not puzzling in any respect.
(There is a distinction between the puzzles though. It is very plausible
to say that it's true in Priest's story that there's an empty box with a
small statue in one corner. It is less plausible to say we really can
imagine such a situation.) Opinion about such cases tends to be fairly
sharply divided, and it is not good I suspect to rest too much weight on
them one way or the other.

The second kind of case Gendler suggests is where we have a
distinctively metaphysical impossibility, such as a singing snowman or a
talking playing card. Similar cases as discussed by Alex @Byrne1993 who
takes them to raise problems for David Lewis's [-@Lewis1978b]
subjunctive conditionals account of truth in fiction. If we believe a
strong enough kind of essentialism, then these will be impossible, but
they clearly do not generate puzzling stories. For a quick proof of
this, note that *Alice in Wonderland* is not puzzling, but several
essentialist theses are violated there. It is true in *Alice in
Wonderland*, for example, that playing cards plant rose trees.

But these examples don't strike me as particularly convincing either.
For one thing, the essentialism assumed here may be wrong. For another,
the essentialism might not be both salient and believed to be right,
which is what is needed. And most importantly, we can easily reinterpret
what the authors are saying in order to be make the story possibly true.
We can assume, for example, that the rosebush planting playing cards are
not *playing cards* as we know them, but roughly human-shaped beings
with playing cards for torsos. Gendler and Byrne each say that this is
to misinterpret the author, but I'm not sure this is true. As some
evidence, note that the authorised illustrations in *Alice* tend to
support the reinterpretations.[^6]

Gendler's third case is better. There are science fiction stories,
especially time travel stories, that are clearly impossible but which do
not generate resistance. Here's two such stories, the first lightly
modified from a surprisingly popular movie, and the second lifted
straight from a very popular source.

Neither of these are puzzling. Perhaps it's hard to imagine the last
couple of sentences of the McFly story, but everything the respective
authors say is true in their stories. So the impossibility theory cannot
be right, because it overgenerates, just as Gendler said.

Recently Kathleen @Stock2003 has argued that one of the assumptions that
Gendler makes, specifically that it isn't true that "a judgement of
conceptual impossibility renders a scenario unimaginable" [@Gendler2000
66] is false. Even if Stock is right, this doesn't threaten the kind of
response that I have (following Gendler) offered to the puzzles. But
actually there are a few reasons to doubt Stock's reply. I'll discuss
these points in order.

It isn't entirely clear from Stock's discussion what she is taking a
conceptual impossibility to be. I *think* it is a proposition of the
form *Some F is a G* (or *That F is a G*, or something of this sort)
where it is constitutive of being an *F* that the *F* is not a *G*.
There is no positive characterisation of conceptual impossibility in
Stock's paper, but it is clearly meant to be something stronger than
mere impossibility, or a priori falsehood. In any case, most of the core
arguments turn on worries about allegedly deploying a concept while
refusing to draw inferences that are constitutive of that concept, so
the kind of definition I've offered above seems to be on the right
track.

Now if this is the case then Stock has no objection to the imaginability
of the two stories I offered that involve known and salient
impossibilities. For neither of these stories includes a conceptual
impossibility in this sense. So even if conceptual impossibilities
cannot be imagined, some impossibilities can be imagined. (And at this
point what holds for imagination also holds for truth in fiction.)

While this suffices as a response to the particular claims Stock makes,
it might be thought it undercuts the objection I have made to the
impossible solution. For it might be thought that what is wrong with the
puzzling sentences just is that they represent *conceptual*
impossibilities in this sense, and we have no argument that these can be
imagined, or true in fiction. This is not too far removed from the
actual solution I will offer, so it is a serious worry. The problem with
this line is that not all of our puzzles are conceptual impossibilities.
It isn't constitutive of being a television that a thing is phenomenally
or functionally distinguishable from a knife, but the claim in *Victory*
that some television is not phenomenally or functionally distinguishable
from a knife is puzzling. Even in our core cases, of morally deviant
claims in fiction, there need not be any conceptual impossibilities. As
R. M. @Hare1951 pointed out long ago, people with very different moral
beliefs could have in common the concept GOOD. Arguably, someone who
thinks that what Craig does in *Death* is good is morally confused, not
conceptually confused. So whether Gendler or Stock is right about the
imaginability of conceptual impossibility is neither here nor there with
respect to these puzzles.

Having said that, there are some reasons to doubt Stock's argument. One
of her moves is to argue that we couldn't imagine conceptual
impossibilities because we can't believe conceptual impossibilities. But
as @Sorensen2001 persuasively argues, we *can* believe conceptual
impossibilities. One of Sorensen's arguments, lightly modified, helps us
respond to another of Stock's arguments. Stock notes, rightly, that we
shouldn't take the fact that it *seems* we can imagine impossibilities
to be conclusive evidence we can do so. After all, we are wrong about
whether things are as they seem all the time. But this might be a
special case. I think that if it seems to be the case that *p* then we
can imagine that *p*. And Stock agrees it *seems* to be the case that we
can imagine conceptual impossibilities. So we can imagine that we can
imagine conceptual impossibilities. Hence it can't be a conceptual
impossibility that we can imagine at least one conceptual impossibility.
This doesn't tell against the claim that it is some other kind of
impossibility, though as we'll see Stock's main argument rests on
considerations about the conceptual structure of imagination, so it
isn't clear how she could argue for this.

The main argument Stock offers is that no account of how concepts work
are compatible with our imagining conceptual impossibilities. Her
argument that atomist theories of concepts (as in @Fodor1998) are
incompatible with imagining conceptual impossibilities isn't that
persuasive. She writes that "clearly it is not the case that imagining
"the cow jumped over the moon" stands in a lawful relation to the
property of being a cow (let alone the property of \[being\] a cow
jumping over the moon. Imagining by its very nature is resistant to any
attempt to incorporate it into an externalist theory of content"
[-@Stock2003 114]. But this isn't clear at all. When I imagine going out
drinking with Bill Clinton there is, indeed there must be, some kind of
causal chain running back from my imagining to Bill Clinton himself. If
there was not, I'd at most be imagining going out drinking with a guy
who looks a lot like Bill Clinton. Perhaps it isn't as clear, but when I
imagine that a cow (and not just a zebra disguised to look like a cow)
is jumping over the moon it's nomologically necessary that there's a
causal chain of the right kind stretching back to actual cows. And it's
arguable that the concept I deploy in imagining that a cow (a real
*cow*) is jumping over the moon just is the concept whose content is
fixed by the lawful connections between various cows and my (initial)
deployment of it. So I don't see why a conceptual atomist should find
this kind of argument convincing.

Stock's response to Gendler was presented at a conference on Imagination
and the Arts at Leeds in 2001, and at the same conference Derek
@Matravers2003 offered an alternative solution to the alethic puzzle.
Although it does not rest on claims about impossibility, it also suffers
from an overgeneration problem. Matravers suggests that in at least some
fictions, we treat the text as a report by a (fictional) narrator
concerning what is going on in a faraway land. Now in reality when we
hear reports from generally trustworthy foreign correspondents, we are
likely to believe their descriptive claims about the facts on the
ground. Since they have travelled to the lands in question, and we have
not, the correspondent is epistemologically privileged with respect to
those facts on the ground. But when the correspondent makes moral
evaluations of those facts, she is not in a privileged position, so we
don't just take her claims as the final word. Matravers suggests there
are analogous limits to how far we trust a fictional narrator.

The problem with this approach is that there are several salient
disanalogies between the position of the correspondent and the fictional
narrator. The following case, which I heard about from Mark Liberman,
illustrates this nicely. On March 5, 2004, the BBC reported that
children in a nursery in England had found a frog with three heads and
six legs. Many people, including Professor Liberman, were sceptical,
notwithstanding the fact that the BBC was actually in England and
Professor Liberman was not. The epistemological privilege generated by
proximity doesn't extend to implausible claims about three-headed frogs.
The obvious disanalogy is that if a fictional narrator said that there
was a three-headed six-legged frog in the children's nursery then other
things being equal we would infer it is true in the fiction that there
was indeed a three-headed six-legged frog in the children's nursery.[^7]
So there isn't an easy analogy between when we trust foreign
correspondents and fictional narrators. Now we need an explanation of
why the analogy does hold when either party makes morally deviant
claims, even though it doesn't when they both make biologically deviant
claims. But it doesn't seem any easier to say why the analogy holds then
than it is to solve the original puzzle.

Two other quick points about Matravers's solution. It's going to be a
little delicate to extend this solution to all the cases I have
discussed above, for normally we do think fictional narrators are
privileged with respect to where the televisions and windows are. What
matters here is that how far narratorial privilege extends depends on
what other claims the narrator makes. Perhaps the same is true of
foreign correspondents, though we'd need to see an argument for that.
Second, it isn't clear how this solution could possibly generalise to
cover cases, such as frequently occurs in plays, where the deviant moral
claim is clearly intended by the author to be true in the fiction but
the reader (or watcher) does not agree even though the author's
intention is recognised. As I mentioned at the start, these cases aren't
our concern here, though it would be nice to see how a generalisation to
these cases is possible. But the primary problem with Matravers's
solution is that as it stands it (improperly) rules out three-headed
frogs in fiction, and it is hard to see how to remedy this problem
without solving the original puzzle.

# Some Ethical Solutions

If one focuses on cases like *Death*, it is natural to think the puzzle
probably has something to do with the special nature of ethical
predicates, or perhaps of ethical concepts, or perhaps of the role of
either of these in fiction. I don't think any such solution can work
because it can't explain what goes wrong in *Victory*, and this will
recur as an objection in what follows.

The most detailed solution to the puzzles has been put forward by Tamar
Szabó Gendler. She focuses on the imaginative puzzle, but she also makes
valuable points about the other puzzles. My solution to the
phenomenological puzzle is basically hers plus a little epicycle.

She says that we do not imagine morally deviant fictional worlds because
of our "general desire to not be manipulated into taking on points of
view that we would not reflectively endorse as our own." How could we
take on a point of view by accepting something in a fiction? Because of
the phenomena noted above that some things become true in a story
*because* they are true in the world. If this is right, its converse
must be true as well. If what is true in the story must match what is
true in the world, then to accept that something is true in the story
just is to accept that it is true in the world. Arguably, the same kind
of 'import/export' principles hold for imagination as for truth in
fiction. Some propositions become part of the content of an imagining
because they are true. So, in the right circumstances, they will only be
part of an imagining if they are true. Hence to imagine them (in the
right circumstances) is to commit oneself to their truth. Gendler holds
that we are sensitive to this phenomena, and that we refuse to accept
stories that are morally deviant because that would involve accepting
that morally deviant claims are true in the world.

That's a relatively rough description of Gendler's theory, but it says
enough to illustrate what she has in mind, and to show where two
objections may slip in. First, it is not clear that it generalises to
all the cases. Gendler is aware of some of these cases and just bites
the relevant bullets. She holds, for instance, that we can imagine that
actually lame jokes are funny, and it could be true in a story that such
a joke is funny. It would be a serious cost to her theory if she had to
say the same thing about *all* the examples discussed above.

The second problem is more serious. The solution is only as good as the
claim that moral claims are more easily exported than descriptive
claims, and more generally that the types of claims we won't imagine are
more easily exported than those we don't resist. Gendler has two
arguments for why the first of these should be true, but neither of them
sounds persuasive. First, she says that the moral claims are true in all
possible worlds if true at all. But this won't do on its own, because
*as she proved*, we don't resist some necessarily false claims. (This
objection is also made by [@Matravers2003 94].)

Secondly, she claims that in other cases where there are necessary
falsehoods true in a story, as in *Alice in Wonderland*, or the science
fiction cases, the author makes it clear that unusual export
restrictions are being imposed. But this is wrong for two reasons.
First, I don't think that any particularly clear signal to this effect
occurs in my version of *Back to the Future*. Secondly, even if I had
explicitly signalled that I had intended to make some of the facts in
the story available for export, and you didn't believe that, that isn't
enough reason to resist imagining the story. For my intent as to what
can and cannot be exported is not part of the story.

To see this, consider one relatively famous example. At one stage B. F.
Skinner tried to promote behaviourism by weaving his theories into a
novel (of sorts): *Walden Two*. Now I'm sure @Skinner1948 intended us to
export some psychological and political claims from the story to the
real world. But it is entirely possible to read the story with full
export restrictions in force without rejecting that what Skinner says is
true in that world. (It is dreadfully boring, since there's nothing but
propagandising going on, but *possible*.) If exporting was the only
barrier here, we should be able to impose our own tariff walls and read
the story along, whatever the intent of the author, as we can with
*Walden Two*. One can accept it is true in *Walden Two* that
behaviourism is the basis of a successful social policy, even though
Skinner wants us to accept this as true in the story iff it is true in
the world, and it isn't true in the world. We cannot read *Death* or
*Victory* with the same ironic detachment, and Gendler's theory lacks
the resources to explain this.

Currie's theory attacks the problem from a quite different direction. He
relies on the motivational consequences of accepting moral claims.
Assume internalism about moral motivation, so to accept that
${\phi}$-ing is right is to be motivated to ${\phi}$, at least ceteris
paribus. So accepting that ${\phi}$-ing is right involves acquiring a
desire to ${\phi}$, as well, perhaps, as beliefs about ${\phi}$-ing.
Currie suggests that there is a mental state that stands to desire the
way that ordinary imagination stands to belief. It is, roughly, a state
of having an off-line desire, in the way that imagining that *p* is like
having an off-line belief that *p*, a state like a belief that *p* but
without the motivational consequences. Currie suggests that imagining
that ${\phi}$-ing is right involves off-line acceptance that
${\phi}$-ing is right, and that in part involves having an off-line
desire (a desire-like imagination) to ${\phi}$. Finally, Currie says, it
is harder to alter our off-line desires at will than it is to alter our
off-line beliefs, and this explains the asymmetry. The argument for this
last claim seems very hasty, but we'll let that pass. For even if it is
true, Currie's theory does little to explain the later cases of
imaginative resistance, from *Alien* *Robbery* to *Victory*. It cannot
explain, why we have resistance to claims about what is rational to
believe, or what is beautiful, or what attitudes other people have. The
idea that there is a state that stands to desire as imagination stands
to belief is I suspect a very fruitful one, but I don't think its fruits
include a solution to these puzzles.

# Grok

Stephen Yablo has suggested that the puzzles, or at least the
imaginative puzzle, is closely linked to what he calls
*response-enabled* concepts, or *grokking* concepts. (I'll also use
response-enabled (grokking) as a property of the predicates that pick
out these concepts.) These are introduced by examples, particularly by
the example 'oval'.

Here are meant to be some platitudes about OVAL. It is a shape concept -
any two objects in any two worlds, counterfactual or counteractual, that
have the same shape are alike in whether they are ovals. But which shape
concept it is is picked out by our reactions. They are the shapes that
strike us as being egg-like, or perhaps more formally, like the shape of
all ellipses whose length/width ratio is the golden ratio. In this way
the concept OVAL meant to be distinguished on the one hand from, say,
PRIME NUMBER, which is entirely independent of us, and from WATER, which
would have picked out a different chemical substance had our reactions
to various chemicals been different. Note that what 'prime number' picks
out is determined by us, like all semantic facts are. So the move space
into which OVAL is meant to fit is quite tiny. We matter to its
extension, but not the way we matter to 'prime number' (or that we don't
matter to PRIME NUMBER), and not the way we matter to 'water'. I'm not
sure there's any space here at all. To my ear, Yablo's grokking
predicates strike me as words that have associated egocentric
descriptions that fix their reference without having egocentric
reference fixing descriptions, and such words presumably don't exist.
But for present purposes I'll bracket those general concerns and see how
this idea can help solve the puzzles. For despite my disagreement about
what these puzzles show about the theory of concepts, Yablo's solution
is not too dissimilar to mine.

The important point for fiction about grokking concepts is that we
matter, in a non-constitutive way, for their extension. Not we as we
might have been, or we as we are in a story, but us. So an author can't
say that in the story squares looked egg-shaped to the people, so in the
story squares are ovals, because *we* get to say what's an oval, not
some fictional character. Here's how Yablo puts it:

> Why should resistance \[meaning, roughly, unimaginability\] and
> grokkingness be connected in this way? It's a feature of grokking
> concepts that their extension in a situation depends on how the
> situation does or would strike us. 'Does or would strike us' *as we

> nothing to do with it. Resistance is the natural consequence. If we
> insist on judging the extension ourselves, it stands to reason that
> any seeming intelligence coming from elsewhere is automatically
> suspect. This applies in particular to being 'told' about the
> extension by an as-if knowledgeable narrator. [-@Yablo2002 485]

It might look at first as if *Victory* will be a counterexample to
Yablo's solution, just as it is to the Ethical solutions. After all, the
concept that seems to generate the puzzles there is TELEVISION, and that
isn't at all like his examples of grokking concepts. (The examples,
apart from evaluative concepts, are all shape concepts.) On the other
hand, if there are any grokking concepts, perhaps it is plausible that
TELEVISION should be one of them. Indeed, the platitudes about
TELEVISION provide some support for this. (The following two paragraphs
rely heavily on @Fodor1998.)

Three platitudes about TELEVISION stand out. One is that it's very hard
to define just what a television is. A second is that there's a striking
correlation between people who have the concept TELEVISION and people
who have been acquainted with a television. Not a perfect correlation -
some infants have acquaintance with televisions but not as such, and
some people acquire TELEVISION by description - but still strikingly
high. And a third is that conversations about televisions are rarely at
cross purposes, even when they consist of people literally talking
different languages. TELEVISION is a shared concept.

Can we put these into a theory of the concept TELEVISION? Fodor suggests
we can, as long as we are not looking for an analysis of TELEVISION.
Televisions are those things that strike us, people in general, as being
sufficiently like the televisions we've seen, in a televisual kind of
way. This isn't an account of the meaning of the word 'television' -
there's no reference to us in that word's dictionary entry, and rightly
so. Nor is it an analysis of what constitutes the concept television.
There's no reference to us there either. But it does latch on to the
right concept, or at least the right extension, in perhaps the only way
we could. And this proposal certainly explains the platitudes well. The
epistemic necessity of having a paradigm television to use as a basis
for similarity judgments explains the striking correlation between
televisual acquaintance and concept possession. The fact that the only
way of picking out the extension uses something that is not constitutive
of the concept, namely our reactions to televisions, explains why we
can't reductively analyse the concept. And the use of people's reactions
in general rather than idiosyncratic reactions explains why its a common
concept. These look like good reasons to think something like Fodor's
theory of the concept TELEVISION is right, and if it is then TELEVISION
seems to be response-enabled in Yablo's sense. So unlike the Ethical
solutions, Yablo's solution might yet predict that *Victory* will be
puzzling.

Still, I have three quibbles about his solution, and that's enough to
make me think a better solution may still to be found.

First, there's a missing antecedent in a key sentence in his account,
and it's hard to see how to fill it in. What does he mean when he says
'how the situation does or would strike us'? Does or would strike us if
*what*? If we were there? But we don't know where there is. There, in
*Victory*, is allegedly a place where televisions look like knifes and
forks. What if the antecedent is *If all the non-grokking descriptions
were accurate*? The problem now is that this will be too light. If
TELEVISION is grokking, then there is a worry that many concepts,
including perhaps all artefact concepts, will be grokking. Fodor didn't
illustrate his theory with TELEVISION, he always used DOORKNOB. But the
theory was meant to be rather general. If we take out all the claims
involving grokking concepts, there may not be much left.

Second, despite the generality of Fodor's account, it isn't clear that
mental concepts, and content concepts, are grokking. We would need
another argument that LOVE is grokking, and that so is BELIEVING THAT
THERE ARE SPACE ALIENS. Perhaps such an argument can be given, but it
will not be a trivial exercise.

Finally, I think this Yablo's solution, at least as most naturally
interpreted, overgeneralises. Here's a counterexample to it. The
following story is not, I take it, puzzling.

> *Fixing a Hole*\
> DQ and his buddy SP leave DQ's apartment at midday Tuesday, leaving a
> well-arranged lounge suite and home theatre unit, featuring DQ's
> prized oval television. They travel back in time to Monday, where DQ

Now this situation would not strike us, were we to see it, as one where
there is a lounge suite and home theatre unit in DQ's apartment midday
Tuesday, for it looks as if there's an ordinary knife and fork there.
But still, the author gets to say that what's in DQ's apartment as the
story opens includes an oval television. And this despite the fact that
the two concepts, TELEVISION and OVAL, are grokking. Perhaps some
epicycles could be added to Yablo's theory to solve this problem, but
for now the solution is incomplete.

# Virtue

The content cases may remind us of one of Fodor's most famous lines
about meaning.

> I suppose that sooner or later the physicists will complete the
> catalogue they've been compiling of the ultimate and irreducible
> properties of things. When they do, the likes of *spin*, *charm*, and

If meaning doesn't go that deep, but there are meaning facts, then those
facts must hold in virtue of more fundamental facts. "Molino de viento"
means windmill in Spanish in virtue of a pattern of usage of those words
by Spanish speakers, for instance.

It seems that many of the stories above involve facts that hold, if they
hold at all, in virtue of other facts. Had Fodor other interests than
intentionality, he may have written instead that beauty doesn't go that
deep, and neither does television. If an event is to be beautiful, this
is a fact that must obtain in virtue of other facts about it, perhaps
its integrity, wholeness, symmetry and radiance as Aquinas says
[@Joyce1944 212], and that event being a monster truck death match of
doom *probably* precludes those facts from obtaining.[^8] If Quixote's
favourite item of furniture is to be a television, this must be in
virtue of it filling certain functional roles, and being
indistinguishable from a common knife probably precludes that.

What is it for a fact to obtain in virtue of other facts obtaining? A
good question, but not one we will answer here. Still, the concept seems
clear enough that we can still use it, as Fodor does. What we have in
mind by 'virtue' is understandable from the examples. One thing to note
from the top is that it is not just supervenience: whether *x* is good
supervenes on whether it is good, but it is not good *in virtue of*
being good. How much our concept differs from supervenience is a little
delicate, but it certainly differs.

Returning to our original example, moral properties are also less than
perfectly fundamental. It is not a primitive fact that the butcher or
the baker is generous, but a fact that obtains in virtue of the way they
treat their neighbours. It is not a primitive fact that what Craig does
is wrong, but a fact that obtains in virtue of the physical features of
his actions.

How are these virtuous relations relevant to the puzzles? To a first
approximation, these relations are always imported into stories and into
imagination. The puzzles arise when we try to tell stories or imagine
scenes where they are violated. The rest of the paper will be concerned
with making this claim more precise, motivating it, and arguing that it
solves the puzzles. In making the claim precise, we will largely be
qualifying it.

The first qualification follows from something we noted at the end of
section 2. We don't know whether puzzles like the ones with which we
started arise whenever there is a clash between real-world morality (or
epistemology or mereology) and the morality (or epistemology or
mereology) the author tries to put in the story. We do know they arise
for simple stories and direct invitations to imagine. So if we aren't to
make claims that go beyond our evidence, we should say there is a
default assumption that these relations are imported into stories or
imaginations, and it is not easy to overcome this assumption. (I will
say for short there is a strong default assumption, meaning just that an
author cannot cancel the assumption by saying so, and that we cannot
easily follow invitations to imagine that violate the relations.)

The second qualification is that sometimes we simply ignore, either in
fiction or imagination, what goes on at some levels of detail. This
means that sometimes, in a sense, the relations are not imported into
the story. For instance, for it to really be true that in a language
that "glory" means *a nice knockdown argument*, this must be true in
virtue of facts about how the speakers of that language use, or are
disposed to use, "glory". But we can simply say in a story that "glory"
in a character's language means *a nice knockdown argument* without
thereby making any more general facts about usage or disposition to use
true in the story.[^9] More generally, we can simply pick a level of
conceptual complexity at which to write our story or conduct our
imaginings. Even if those concepts apply, when they do, in virtue of
more basic facts, no more basic facts need be imported into the story.
For a more vivid, if more controversial, example, one might think that
cows are cows in virtue of their DNA having certain chemical
characteristics. But when we imagine a cow jumping over the moon, we
need not imagine anything about chemistry. Those facts are simply below
the radar of our imagining. What do we mean then when we say that these
relations are imported into the story? Just that if the story regards
both the higher-level facts and the lower-level facts as being within
its purview, then they must match up. This does not rule out the
possibility of simply leaving out all lower-level facts from the story.
In general the same thing is true for imagining, though we will look at
some cases below where we it seems there is a stronger constraint on
imagining.

The third qualification is needed to handle an example pressed on me by
a referee. Recall our example *Fixing a Hole*.

> *Fixing a Hole*\
> DQ and his buddy SP leave DQ's apartment at midday Tuesday, leaving a
> well-arranged lounge suite and home theatre unit, featuring DQ's
> prized oval television. They travel back in time to Monday, where DQ
> has some rather strange and unexpected adventures. He intended to

> an ordinary knife and fork.

In this story it seems that on Tuesday there is a television that looks
exactly like a knife. If we interpret the claim about the relations
between higher-level facts and the lower-level facts as a kind of
impossibility claim, e.g. as the claim that a conjunction
*p* ${\wedge}$ *q* is never true in a story if the conditional *If q,
then* *p* *is false in virtue of q being true* is true, then we have a
problem. Let *p* be the claim that there is a television, and let *q* be
the claim that the only things in the apartment looked life a knife and
fork. If that's how the more basic phenomenal and functional facts are,
then there isn't a television in virtue of those facts. (That is, this
relation between phenomenal and functional facts and facts about where
the televisions are really holds.) So this rule would say
*p* ${\wedge}$ *q* could not be true in the story. But in fact
*p* ${\wedge}$ *q* is true in the story.

The difficulty here is that *Fixing a Hole* is a contradictory story,
and contradictory stories need care. First, here's how we should
interpret the rule

> *Virtue*\
> If *p* is the kind of claim that if true must be true in virtue of
> lower-level facts, and if the story is about those lower-level facts,
> then it must be true in the story that there is some true proposition
> *r* which is about those lower-level facts such that *p* is true in
> virtue of *r*.

In *Fixing a Hole* there are some true lower-level claims that are
inconsistent with there being a television. But there is also in the
story a true proposition about how DQ's television looked before his
time-travel misadventure. And it is true (both in reality and in the
story) that something is a television in virtue of looking that way.
(Note that we don't say there must be some proposition *r* that is true
in the story in virtue of which *p* is true. For there is no fact of the
matter in *Fixing a Hole* about how DQ's television looked before he
left. So in reality we could not find such a proposition. But it is true
in the story that his television looks some way or other, so as long as
we talk about what in the story is true, and don't quantify over
propositions that are (in reality) true in the story, we avoid this
pitfall.)

So my solution to the alethic puzzle is that *Virtue* is a strong
default principle of fictional interpretation. I haven't done much yet
to motivate it, apart from noting that it seems to cover a lot of the
cases that have been raised without overgenerating in the manner of the
impossible solution. A more positive motivation must wait until I have
presented my solutions to the phenomenological and imaginative puzzles.
I'll do that in the next section, then in tell a story about why we
should believe *Virtue*.

# More Solutions

### The Phenomenological Puzzle

My solution here is essentially the same as Gendler's. She think that
when we strike a sentence that generated imaginative resistance we
respond with something like, "That's what you think!" What makes this
notable is that it's constitutive of playing the fiction game that we
not normally respond that we way, that we give the author some
flexibility in setting up a world. I think that's basically right, but a
little more is needed to put the puzzle to bed.

Sometimes the "That's what you think!" response does not constitute
abandoning the fiction game. At times it is the only correct way to play
the game. It's the right thing to say *to Lily* when reading the first
line of *The Dead*. (Maybe it would be rude to say it *aloud* to poor
Lily, the poor girl is run off her feet after all, but it's appropriate
to think it.) This pattern recurs throughout *Dubliners*. When in
*Eveline* the narrator says that Frank has sailed around the world, the
right reaction is to say to Eveline (or whoever is narrating then),
"That's what you think!" There's a cost to playing the game this way. We
end up knowing next to nothing about Frank. But it is not as if making
the move stops us playing, or even stops us playing correctly. It's part
of the point of *Eveline* that we know next to nothing about Frank.

What makes cases like *Death* and *Victory* odd is that our reaction is
directed at someone who isn't in the story. One of Alex Byrne's
[-@Byrne1993] criticisms of Lewis was that on Lewis's theory it is true
in every story that the story is being told. Byrne argued that in many
fictions it is not true that in the fictional world there is someone
sufficiently knowledgeable to tell the story. In these fictions, we have
a story without a storyteller. If there are such stories, then
presumably *Death* and *Victory* are amongst them. It is not a character
in the story who ends by saying that Craig's action was right or that
Quixote's apartment contains a television. The *author* says that, and
hence deserves our reproach, but the author isn't in the story. Saying
"That's what you think!" directly to him or her breaks the fictional
spell for suddenly we have to recognise a character not in the fictional
world.

This proposal for the phenomenological puzzle yields a number of
predictions which seem to be true and interesting. First, a story that
has a narrator should not generate a phenomenological puzzle, even when
outlandish moral claims are made. The more prominent the narrator, the
less striking the moral claim. Imagine, for example, a version of
*Death* where the text purports to be Craig's diary, and it includes
naturally enough his own positive evaluation of what he did. We wouldn't
believe him, of course, but we wouldn't be struck by the claim the same
way we are in the actual version of *Death*.

One might have thought that what is shocking is what we discover about
the author. But this isn't right, as can be seen if we reflect on
stories that contain Craig's diary. It is possible, difficult but
possible, to embed the diary entry corresponding to *Death* in a longer
story where it is clear that the author endorses Craig's opinions.
(Naturally I won't do this. Examples have to come to an end somewhere.)
Such a story would, in a way, be incredibly shocking. But it wouldn't
make the final line shocking in just the way that the final line of
*Death* is shocking. Our reactions to these cases suggest that the
strikingness of the last line of *Death* is not a function of what it
reveals about the author, but of how it reveals it.

The final prediction my theory makes is somewhat more contentious. Some
novels announce themselves as works of fiction. They go out of their way
to prevent you ignoring the novel's role as mediation to a fictional
world. (For an early example of this, consider the sudden appearance of
newspaper headlines in the 'Aeolus' episode of *Ulysses*.) In such
novels we already have to recognise the author as a player in the
fictional game, if not a character in the story. I predict that
sentences where we do not take what is written to really be true in the
story, even though this is what the author intended, should be less
striking in these cases because we are already used to reacting to the
author *as such* rather than just to the characters. Such books go out
of their way to break the fictional spell, so spell breaking should
matter less in these cases. I think this prediction is correct, although
the works in question tend to be so complicated that it is hard to
generate clear intuitions about them.

### The Imaginative Puzzle

Imagine, if you will, a chair. Have you done so? Good. Let me make some
guesses about what you imagined. First, it was a specific kind of chair.
There is a fact of the matter about whether the chair you imagined is,
for example, an armchair or a dining chair or a classroom chair or an
airport lounge chair or an outdoor chair or an electric chair or a
throne. We can verbally represent something as being a chair without
representing it as being a specific kind of chair, but imagination
cannot be quite so coarse.[^10]

Secondly, what you imagined was incomplete in some respects. You
possibly imagined a chair that if realised would contain some stitching
somewhere, but you did not imagine any details about the stitching.
There is no fact of the matter about how the chair you imagined holds
together, if indeed it does. If you imagined a chair by imagining
bumping into something chair-like in the dead of night, you need not
have imagined a chair of any colour, although in reality the chair would
have some colour or other.[^11]

Were my guesses correct? Good. The little I needed to know about
imagination to get those guesses right goes a long way towards solving
the puzzle.

Chairs are not very distinctive. Whenever we try to imagine that a
non-fundamental property is instantiated the content of our imagining
will be to some extent more specific than just that the object imagined
has the property, but not so much more specific as to amount to a
complete description of a possibilia. It's the latter fact that does the
work in explaining how can imagine impossible situations. If we were,
foolishly, to try to fill in all the details of the impossible science
fiction cases it would be clear they contained not just impossibilities,
but violations of *Virtue*, and then we would no longer be able to
imagine them. But we can imagine the restaurant at the end of the
universe without imagining it in all its glorious gory detail. And when
we do so our imagining appears to contain no such violations.

But why can't we imagine these violations in fictions? It is primarily
because we can only imagine the higher-level claim some way or another,
just as we only imagine a chair as some chair or other, and the
instructions that go along with the fiction forbid us from imagining
*any* relevant lower-level facts that would constitute the truth of the
higher-level claim. We have not stressed it much above, but it is
relevant that fictions understood as invitations to imagine have a
"That's all" clause.[^12] We are not imagining *Death* if we imagine
that Jack and Jill had just stopped arguing with each other and were
about to shoot everyone in sight when Craig shot them in self-defence.
The story does not explicitly say that wasn't about to happen. It
doesn't include a "That's all" clause. But such clauses have to be
understood. So not only are we instructed to imagine something that
seems incompatible with Craig's action being morally acceptable, we are
also instructed (tacitly) to *not* imagine anything that would make it
the case that his action is morally acceptable. But we can't simply
imagine moral goodness in the abstract, to imagine it we have to imagine
a particular kind of goodness.

### Two Thoughts Too Many?

I have presented three solutions to the three different puzzles with
which we started. Might it not be better to have a uniform solution? No,
because although the puzzles are related, they are not identical. Three
puzzles demand three solutions.

We saw already that the phenomenological puzzle is different to the
other two. If we rewrite *Death* as Craig's diary there would be nothing
particularly striking about the last sentence, certainly in the context
of the story as so told. But the last sentence generates alethic and
imaginative puzzles. Or at least it could generate these puzzles if the
author has made it clear elsewhere in the story that Craig's voice is
authoritative. So we shouldn't expect the same solution to that puzzle
as the other two.

The alethic puzzle is different to the other two because ultimately it
depends on what the moral and conceptual truths are not on what we take
them to be. Consider the following story.

> *The Benefactor*\
> Smith was a very generous, just and in every respect moral man. Every
> month he held a giant feast for the village where they were able to
> escape their usual diet of gains, fruits and vegetables to eat the
> many and varied meats that Smith provided for them.

Consider in particular, what should be easy to some, how *Benefactor*
reads to someone who believes that we are morally required to be
vegetarian if this is feasible. In *Benefactor* it is clear in the story
that most villagers can survive on a vegetarian diet. So it is morally
wrong to serve them the many and varied meats that Smith does. Hence
such a reader should disagree with the author's assessment that Smith is
moral 'in every respect'. Such a reader will think that in fact in the
story Smith is quite immoral in one important respect.

Now for our final assumption. Assume it is really true that we morally
shouldn't eat meat if it is avoidable. Since the ethical vegetarians
have true ethical beliefs about the salient facts here, it seems
plausible that their views on what is true in the story should carry
more weight than ours. (I'm just relying on a general epistemological
principle here: other things being equal trust the people who have true
beliefs about the relevant background facts.) So it seems that it really
is false in the story that Smith is in every respect moral. *Benefactor*
raises an alethic puzzle even though for non-vegetarians it does not
raise a phenomenological or imaginative puzzle.

This point generalises, so we need not assume for the general point that
vegetarianism is true or that our typical reader is not vegetarian. We
can be very confident that *some* of our ethical views will be wrong,
though for obvious reasons it is hard to say which ones. Let *p* be a
false moral belief that we have. And let *S* be a story in which *p* is
asserted by the (would-be omniscient) narrator. For reasons similar to
what we said about *Benefactor*, *p* is not true in *S*. But *S* need
not raise any imaginative or phenomenological puzzles. Hence the alethic
puzzle is different to the other two puzzles.

# Why Virtue Matters

I owe you an argument for why authors should be unable to easily
generate violations of *Virtue*, though there is no general bar on
making impossibilities true in a story. My general claims here are not
too dissimilar to Yablo's solution to the puzzles, but there are a
couple of distinctive new points. Before we get to the argument, it's
time for another story.

Three design students walk into an furniture showroom. The new season's
fashions are all on display. The students are all struck by the *piece
de resistance*, though they are all differently struck by it. Over
drinks later, it is revealed that while B and C thought it was a chair,
A did not. But the differences did not end there. When asked to sketch
this contentious object, A and B produced identical sketches, while C's
recollections were drawn somewhat differently. B clearly disagrees with
both A and C, but her differences with each are quite different. With C
she disagrees on some simple empirical facts, what the object in
question looked like. With A she disagrees on a conceptual fact, or
perhaps a semantic fact, whether the concept CHAIR, or perhaps just the
term 'chair', applies to the object in question. As it turns out, A and
B agree that 'chair' means CHAIR, and agree that CHAIR is a public
concept so one of them is right and the other wrong about whether this
object falls under the concept. In this case, their disagreement will
have a quite different feel to B's disagreement with C. It may well be
that there is no analytic/synthetic distinction, and that questions
about whether an object satisfies a concept are always empirical
questions, but this is not how it feels to A and B. They feel that they
agree on what the world is like, or at least what this significant
portion of it is like, and disagree just on which concepts apply to it.

The difference between these two kinds of disagreement is at the basis
of our attitudes towards the alethic puzzle. It may look like we are
severely cramping authorial freedom by not permitting violations of
*Virtue*.[^13] From A and B's perspective, however, this is no
restriction at all. Authors, they think, are free to stipulate which
world will be the site of their fiction. But as their disagreement about
whether the *piece de resistance* was a chair showed, we can agree about
which world we are discussing and disagree about which concepts apply to
it. The important point is that the metaphysics and epistemology of
concepts comes apart here.

There can be no difference in whether the concept CHAIR applies without
a difference in the underlying facts. But there can be a difference of
opinion about whether a thing is a chair without a difference of opinion
about the underlying facts. The fact that it's the author's story, not
the reader's, means that the author gets to say what the underlying
facts are. But that still leaves the possibility for differences of
opinion about whether there are chairs, and on that question the
author's opinion is just another opinion.

Authorial authority extends as far as saying which world is fictional in
their story, it does not extend as far as saying which concepts are
instantiated there. Since the main way that we specify which world is
fictional is by specifying which concepts are instantiated at it,
authorial authority will usually let authors get away with any kind of
conceptual claim. But once we have locked onto the world being
discussed, the author has no special authority to say which concepts,
especially which higher-level concepts like RIGHT or FUNNY or CHAIR are
instantiated there.

(Does it matter much that the distinction between empirical
disagreements and conceptual disagreements with which I started might
turn out not to rest on very much? Not really. I am trying to explain
why we have the attitudes towards fiction that we do, which in turn
determines what is true in fiction generally. All that matters is that
people generally think that there is something like a conceptual
truth/empirical truth distinction, and I think enough people would agree
that A and B's disagreement is different in kind from B and C's
disagreement to show that is true. If folks are generally wrong about
this, if there is no difference in kind between conceptual truths and
empirical truths, then our communal theory of truth in fiction will rest
on some fairly untenable supports. But it will still be our theory,
although any coherent telling of it will have to be in terms of things
that are taken to be conceptual truths and things that are taken to be
empirical truths.)

This explanation of why authorial authority collapses just when it does
yields one fairly startling, and I think true, prediction. I argued
above that authors could not easily generate violations of *Virtue*.
That this is impossible is compatible with any number of hypotheses
about how readers will resolve those impossibilities that authors
attempt to slip in. The story here, that authors get to say which world
is at issue but not which concepts apply to it, yields the prediction
that readers will resolve the tension in favour of the lower-level
claims. When given a physical description of a world and an incompatible
moral description, we will take the physical description to fix which
world is at issue and reduce the moral description to a series of
questionable claims about the world. Compare what happens with A, B and
C. We take A and B to agree about the world and disagree about concepts,
rather than say taking B and C to agree about what the world is like
(there's a chair at the heart of the furniture show) and say that A and
B disagree about the application of some recognitional concepts. This
prediction is borne out in every case discussed in . We do not conclude
that Craig did not really shoot Jack and Jill, because after all the
world at issue is stipulated to be one where he did the right thing.
Even more surprisingly, we do not conclude that Quixote's furniture does
not look like kitchen utensils, because it consists of a television and
an armchair. This is surprising because in *Victory* I never said that
the furniture looked like kitchen utensils. The *tacit* low-level claim
about appearances is given precedence over the *explicit* high-level
claims about which objects populate Quixote's apartment. The theory
sketched here predicts that, and supports the solution to the alethic
puzzle sketched in , which is good news for both the theory and the
solution.

It's been a running theme here that the puzzles do not have anything
particularly to do with normativity. But some normative concepts raise
the kind of issues about authority mentioned here in a particularly
striking way. There is always some division of cognitive labour in
fiction. The author's role is, among other things, to say which world is
being made fictional. The audience's role is, among other things, to
determine the artistic merit of the fictional work. On other points
there may be some sharing of roles, but this division is fairly
absolute. The division threatens to collapse when authors start
commenting on the aesthetic quality of words produced by their
characters. At the end of *Ivy Day in the Committee Room* Joyce has one
character describe a poem just recited by another character as "A fine
piece of writing" [@Joyce1914 105]. Most critics seem to be happy to
*accept* the line, because Joyce's poem here really is, apparently, a
fine piece of writing. But to me it seems rather jarring, even if it
happens to be true. It's easy to feel a similar reaction when characters
in a drama praise the words of another character.[^14] This is a
special, and especially vivid, illustration of the point I've been
pushing towards here. The author gets to describe the world at whichever
level of detail she chooses. But once it has been described, the reader
has just as much say in which higher-level concepts apply to parts of
that world. When the concepts are evaluative concepts that directly
reflect on the author, the reader's role rises from being an equal to
having more say than the author, just as we normally have less say than
others about which evaluative concepts apply to us.

This idea is obviously similar to Yablo's point that we get to decide
when grokking concepts apply, not the author. But it isn't quite the
same. I think that if any concepts are grokking, most concepts are, so
it can't be the case that authors never get to say when grokking
concepts apply in their stories. Most of the time authors will get to
say which grokking concepts apply, because they have to use them to tell
us about the world. What's special about the kind of concepts that cause
puzzles is that we get to decide when they apply full stop, but that we
get to decide how they apply *given how more fundamental concepts
apply*. So the conciliatory version of the relation between my picture
here and Yablo's is that I've been filling in, in rather laborious
detail, his missing antecedent.

# Two Hard Cases

The first hard case is suggested by Kendall @Walton1994. Try to imagine
a world where the over-riding moral duty is to maximise the amount of
nutmeg in the world. If you are like me, you will find this something of
a challenge. Now consider a story *Nutmeg* that reads (in its
entirety!): "Nobody ever discovered this, but it turned out all along
their over-riding moral duty was to maximise the amount of nutmeg in the
world." What is true in *Nutmeg*? It seems that there are no violations
of *Virtue* here, but it is hard to imagine what is being described.

The second hard case is suggested by Tamar Szabó @Gendler2000. (I'm
simplifying this case a little, but it's still hard.) In her *Tower of
Goldbach*, God decrees that 12 shall no longer be the sum of two primes,
and from this it follows (even in the story) that it is not the sum of 7
and 5. (It is not clear why He didn't just make 5 no longer prime - say
the product of 68 and 57. That may have been simpler.) Interestingly,
this has practical consequences. When a group of seven mathematicians
from one city attempts to join a group of five from another city, they
no longer form a group of twelve. Again, two questions. Can we imagine a
Goldbachian situation, where 7 and 5 equal not 12? Is it true in
Gendler's story that 7 and 5 equal not 12? If we cannot imagine
Goldbach's tower, where is the violation of *Virtue*?

First a quick statement of my responses to the two cases then I'll end
with my detailed responses. To respond properly we need to tease apart
the alethic and imaginative puzzles. I claim that the alethic puzzle
only arises when there's a violation of *Virtue*. There's no violation
in either story, so there is no alethic puzzle. I think there are
independent arguments for this conclusion in both cases. We can't
imagine either (if we can't) because any way of filling in the more
basic facts leads to violations.

It follows from my solution to the alethic puzzle that Nutmegism (Tyler
Doggett's name for the principle that we must maximise quantities of
nutmeg) could be true in a story. There is no violation in *Nutmeg*,
since there are no lower level claims made. Still, the story is very
hard to imagine. The reason for this is quite simple. As noted, we
cannot just imagine a chair, we have to imagine something more detailed
that is a chair in virtue of its more basic properties. (There is no
particular more basic property we need imagine, as is shown by the fact
that we can imagine a chair just by imagining something with a certain
look, or we can imagine a chair in the dark with no visual
characteristics. But there is always *something* more basic.) Similarly
to imagine a duty, we have to imagine something more detailed, in this
case presumably a society or an ecology, in virtue of which the duty
exists. But no such possible, or even impossible, society readily
springs to mind. So we cannot imagine Nutmegism is true.

But it is hard to see how, or why, this inability should be raised into
a restriction on what can be true in a story. One might think that what
is wrong with *Nutmeg* is that the fictional world is picked out using
high-level predicates. If we extend the story *any way at all*, the
thought might go, we will generate a violation of *Virtue*. And that is
enough to say that Nutmegism is not true in the story. But actually this
isn't quite right. If we extend the story by adding more *moral* claims,
there is no duty to minimise suffering, there is no duty to help the
poor etc, there are still no violations in the story. The restriction we
would have to impose is that there is no way of extending the story to
fill out the facts in virtue of which the described facts obtain,
without generating a violation. But that looks like too strong a
constraint, mostly because if we applied it here, to rule out Nutmegism
being true in *Nutmeg*, we would have to apply it to every story written
in a higher level language than that of microphysics. It doesn't *seem*
true that we have to be able to continue a story all the way to the
microphysical before we can be confident that what the author says
about, for instance, where the furniture in the room is. So there's no
reason to not take the author's word in *Nutmeg*, and since the default
is always that what the author says is true, Nutmegism is true in the
story.

The mathematical case is more difficult. The argument that 7 and 5 could
fail to equal 12 in the story turns on an example by Gregory
@Currie1990. (The main conclusions of this example are also endorsed by
@Byrne1993.) Currie imagines a story in which the hero refutes Gödel's
Incompleteness Theorem. Currie argues that the story could be written in
such a way that it is true in the story not merely that everyone
believes our hero refuted Gödel, but that she really did. But if it
could be true in a story that Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem could be
false, then it's hard to see just why it could not be true in a story
that a simpler arithmetic claim, say that 7 and 5 make 12, could also be
false. Anything that can't be true in a story can't be true in virtue of
some feature it has. The only difference between Gödel's Incompleteness
Theorem and a simple arithmetic statement appears to be the simplicity
of the simple statement. And it doesn't seem possible, or advisable, to
work that kind of feature into a theory of truth in fiction.

The core problem here is that how simple a mathematical impossibility is
very much a function of the reader's mathematical knowledge and acumen.
Some readers probably find the unique prime factorisation theorem so
simple and evident that for them a story in which it is false is as
crashingly bad as a story in which 7 and 5 do not make 12. For other
readers, it is so complex that a story in which it has a counterexample
is no more implausible than a story in which Gödel is refuted. I think
it cannot be true for the second reader that the unique prime
factorisation theorem fails in the story and false for the first reader.
That amounts to a kind of relativism about truth in fiction that seems
preposterous. But I agree with Currie that some mathematical
impossibilities can be true in a fiction. So I conclude that, whether it
is imaginable or not, it could be true in a story that 7 and 5 not equal
12.

I think, however, that it is impossible to imagine that 7 plus 5 doesn't
equal 12. Can we explain that unimaginability in the same way we
explained why *Nutmeg* couldn't be imagined? I think we can. It seems
that the sum of 7 and 5 is what it is in virtue of the relations between
7, 5 and other numbers. It is not primitive that various sums take the
values they take. That would be inconsistent with, for example, it being
constitutive of addition that it's associative, and associativity does
seem to be constitutive of addition. We cannot think about 7, 5, 12 and
addition without thinking about those more primitive relations. So we
cannot imagine 7 and 5 equally anything else. Or so I think. There's
some rather sophisticated, or at least complicated, philosophy of
mathematics in the story here, and not everyone will accept all of it.
So we should predict that not everyone will think that these arithmetic
claims are unimaginable. And, pleasingly, not everyone does. Gendler,
for instance, takes it as a data point that *Tower of Goldbach* is
imaginable. So far so good. Unfortunately, if the story is true we
should also expect that whether people find the story imaginable links
up with the various philosophies of mathematics they believe. And the
evidence for that is thin. So there may be more work to do here. But
there is clearly *a* story that we can tell that handles the case.

    behind it, see @Kidd1988. The good doctor appears on page 6 of
    @Joyce1922.

[^3]: At least, they will be ignored if it is clear they are *errors*.
    If there seems to be a method behind the misspellings, as in
    *Ulysses* there frequently is, the matter is somewhat different, and
    somewhat more difficult.

    Tyler Doggett has argued that these cases are more similar to
    paradigm cases of imaginative resistance than I take them to be.
    Indeed, I would not have noticed the problems they raise without
    reading his paper. It may be a shortcoming of my theory here that I
    have to set questions about whether these sentences are puzzling to
    one side and assume an ideal proof-reader.

[^4]: Thanks here to George Wilson for reminding me that we haven't
    shown anything stronger than that.

[^5]: Arguably the relevant supervenience principle is even stronger
    than that. To use some terminology of Stephen Yablo's, there's no
    difference in moral facts without a difference in non-moral facts
    between any two *counteractual* worlds, as well as between any two
    *counterfactual* worlds. This might be connected to some claims I
    will make below about the relationship between the normative and the
    descriptive.

[^6]: Determining whether this is true in *all* such stories would be an
    enormous task, I fear, and somewhat pointless given the next
    objection. If anyone wants to say all clearly impossible statements
    in fiction are puzzling, I suspect the best strategy is to divide
    and conquer. The most blatantly impossible claims are most naturally
    fit for reinterpretation, and the other claims rest on an
    essentialism that is arguably not proven. I won't try such a massive
    defence of a false theory *here*.

[^7]: There is a complication here in that such a sentence *might* be
    evidence that the fictional work is not to be understood as this
    kind of report, and instead understood as something like a recording
    of the children's thoughts. I'll assume we're in a story where it is
    clear that the sentences are not to be so interpreted.

[^8]: Although it isn't obvious just which of the Thomistic properties
    the death match lacks.

[^9]: Do we make facts about the actual speaker's usage true in the
    story? No. The character might have idiosyncratic reasons for not
    using the word "glory", and for ignoring all others who use it.
    That's consistent with the word meaning a nice knockdown argument.

[^10]: This relates to another area in which my solution owes a debt to
    Gendler's solution. Supposing can be coarse in a way that imagining
    cannot. We can suppose that Jack sold a chair without supposing that
    he sold an armchair or a dining chair or any particular kind of
    chair at all. Gendler concludes that what we do in fiction, where we
    try and imagine the fictional world, is very different to what we
    do, say, in philosophical argumentation, where we often suppose that
    things are different to the way they actually are. We can suppose,
    for the sake of argument as it's put, that Kantian or Aristotelian
    ethical theories are entirely correct, even if we have no idea how
    to imagine either being correct. Thanks to Tyler Doggett for
    pointing out the connection to Gendler here.

[^11]: Thanks to Kendall Walton for pointing out this possibility.

[^12]: "That's all" clauses play a distinct, but related, role in
    [@Jackson1998 Ch. 1]. It's also crucial to my solution to the
    alethic puzzle that there be a "That's all" clause in the story.
    What's problematic about these cases is that the story (implicitly)
    rules out there being the lower-level facts that would make the
    expressed higher-level claims true.

[^13]: Again, it is worth noting that I am not ruling out any violation
    of *Virtue*, just easy violations of it. The point being made in the
    text is that even a blanket ban on violations would not be a serious
    restriction on authorial freedom.

[^14]: For a while this would happen frequently on the TV series *The
    West Wing*. President Bartlett would deliver a speech, and
    afterwards his staffers would congratulate themselves on what a good
    speech it was. The style of the congratulations was clearly intended
    to convey the author's belief that the speech they themselves had
    written was a good speech, not just the characters' beliefs to this
    effect. When in fact it was a very bad speech, this became very
    jarring. In later series they would often not show the speeches in
    question and hence avoid this problem.
