title: "Four Problems in Decision Theory"
description: |
  In recent years the literature on decision theory has become disjointed. There isn't as much discussion as there should be on how different problems impact one another. This paper aims to bring together work on problems involving demons, problems about attitudes to risk, problems about incomplete preferences, and problems about dynamic choice. In the first three of these cases, I end up defending a pre-existing view, but in each case the argument for that view is strengthened by seeing how the premises that support it are essential to solving one of the other problems. The most novel part of the view is the theory of dynamic choice that I offer: a sequence of choices is rational only if both the so-called 'resolute' and 'sophisticated' theories of dynamic choice would permit it. This theory would be implausible if paired with many rival solutions to the first three problems, but fits nicely with the view I'll develop through the paper that decision theory is much less constraining than most theorists hold.

Contemporary decision theory has become disjointed. There is less overlap than there should be in working on adjacent problems. This paper aims to undo some of that, by showing that four problems that have largely been worked on in isolation cast useful light on each other. Some of the conclusions that draw will be familiar: Iâ€™m going to defend views similar to those defended by Melissa @Fuscond and by Harvey @Ledermannd. But in each case the arguments will be novel, and I'll end up defending a novel view on dynamic choice.

This paper is part of a broader project of identifying the decision theory that is implicit in standard, textbook approaches to game theory, and arguing that this decision theory is better than the ones currently on the philosophical market. I used to think the first part of this project would be boring - game theorists are just typical Causal Decision Theorists. This can't be true for five reasons. First, these textbooks don't mention counterfactuals at all, but counterfactuals are central to typical presentations of Causal Decision Theory. Second, solution concepts in game theory are typically not _single-valued_, in the technical sense defined by @Pearce1984, while typical versions of Causal Decision Theory are single-valued. Third, sometimes the unique solution to a game involves mixed strategies, while Causal Decision Theory, in its typical formulations, never says that a mixed strategy is uniquely optimal. Fourth, the solution concepts used for things like the beer-quiche game [@ChoKreps1987] put constraints that go beyond coherence constraints on the players, and typical formulations of Causal Decision Theory allow any coherent credence function. Finally, the textbook solution concepts for dynamic games don't correspond to any view in the philosophical literature on dynamic games.

Game theory textbooks tend to be several hundred pages, and identifying all the unique characteristics of the implicit decision theory, like the four from the previous paragraph, would take just as much space. So I'm going to simplify a lot here. In particular, I'm not going to talk about mixed strategies, except occasionally in footnotes. That is, I'm not going to assume anything about the availability or unavailability of mixed strategies in the arguments I put forward. That said, some of the positions I put forward are similar enough to existing positions that there are well known objections in the literature, and in many cases my preferred response to those objections does rely on the availability of mixed strategies. Getting all the details of those right would massively extend the paper, so I'll stay away from those discussions here. Relatedly, while I will spend a lot of time on problems where there are multiple pure strategy equilibria, I won't discuss any problems where there are no pure strategy equilibria. Those are four another day. With that qualification in place, it's time to get to the four problems I will discuss.

# Four Problems

## Demons

When a student starts decision theory, they are introduced to a view that is simple, elegant, and wrong. The view says that a chooser, hereafter called Chooser, has a set of possible actions *A* available. We'll use *a* to represent an arbitrary member of that set. And there is a set of possible states *S*, with *s* being used to pick out an arbitrary member. It is assumed that a probability distribution Pr over *S* is given, and that each action-state pair has a numerical value. I'll write *V* for the value function, so *V*(*as*) is the value of performing act *a* in state *s*.

The simple, elegant, and wrong theory is that Chooser should value each act *a* by its expected value, where this is $\sum_{s \in S} \Pr(s)V(as)$. And Chooser should then choose the act with the highest value.

The problem with this view is that if Chooser has any influence over which state is actual, then this view will recommend obviously bad actions. Assume that the only possibly actions are *a* and *b*, the only two states are *s* and *t*, and while *a* will almost certainly cause *s* to be actual, *b* will almost certainly cause *b* to be actual. Now let the payoffs for all four action-state combinations be as in @tbl-joycewindow.

|     | *s* |  *t*  |
|:---:|:---:|:-----:|
| *a* |  1  | 1001  |
| *b* |  0  | 1000  |

: A counterexample to the simple theory {#tbl-joycewindow}

The problem is that in @tbl-joycewindow it obviously makes sense to do *b*, since that brings about the best option, but the simple theory says that the value of *a* is 1 more than the value of *b*. So @tbl-joycewindow is a counterexample to the simple theory. So far every decision theorist would agree. But here agreement ends. There is no agreement on either why the simple theory fails in this case, or what should go in its place.

Evidential decision theorists such as @Ahmed2014 say the problem is that there is an evidential connection between the acts and the states. They say that instead of the simple theory Chooser should value options using this formula.

EDT
:    $V(a) = \sum_{s \in S} \Pr(s|a)V(as)$

As with the simple theory, the rule is just to maximise value. The difference is just that instead of the unconditional probability of a state, we use the conditional probability of a state given that the action is performed. This will get the right result in @tbl-joycewindow, but gives some strange results in other cases.

Reinterpret @tbl-joycewindow so that the states are causally independent of the actions, but the actions are evidence for the state. To use the standard example, going back to @Nozick1969, imagine that a demon (hereafter called Demon) has predicted Chooser's choice. There is no backwards causation, so Chooser's choice is causally independent of Demon's prediction. But Chooser believes Demon is incredibly reliable, so $\Pr(s | a) \approx 1$, and $\Pr(t | b) \approx 1$. For ease of reference, I'll use the relabelled version in @tbl-newcomb for the problem when the actions are probabilistically, but not causally, connected to the states. In @tbl-newcomb, Chooser selects **U**p or **D**own, and Demon **P**redicts this choice. In general in what follows, if a state is labelled **PX**, it means that Demon has predicted that Chooser will select X. Using that notation @tbl-newcomb is just Newcomb's Problem.

|       | **PU** |  **PD**  |
|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|
| **U** |  1     |  1001    |
| **D** |  0     |  1000    |

: Newcomb's Problem {#tbl-newcomb}

In @tbl-newcomb, EDT says that Chooser should do *a*. There is a simple argument that Chooser should do *b*: whatever the world is like, it will have a higher return. This argument convinced many people that we need a different theory, and over the 1970s and 1980s a lot of people settled on something like CfDT as the right alternative.

CfDT
:    $V(a) = \sum_{s \in S} \Pr(a \nobreakspace\Box\rightarrow s)V(as)$

That's a way to value options; the theory is just that one should choose the option with maximal value. Recently Brian @Hedden2023 has argued that this theory is preferable to typical versions of Causal Decision Theory. I'm sympathetic to the reply offered by Dmitri @Gallowndppq that this just is what Causal Decision Theorists in the 1970s and 1980s were typically defending. But I also think, for reasons that will soon become clear, that some other theories which are quite different to this are also *causal* in the relevant sense. So from now on I'll use "Causal Decision Theory" to name a family of theories, and CfDT will be a distinctive member of that family.

Another theory in that family says that the simple theory was essentially correct, it was just applied at the wrong time. This theory, which I'll call Gamified Decision Theory, or GDT, starts with the following two claims. First, the relevant state probabilities are those at the end of deliberation, once a choice has been made, not at the start of deliberation. Second, when we use those _ex post_ probabilities, the simple theory is fine. In symbols, the core formula that GDT uses is this.

GDT
:    $V(a) = \sum_{s \in S} \Pr^{\prime}(s)V(as)$

In this formula, Pr^$\prime$^ is the probability distribution over states after Chooser has made their decision. GDT says that only options that have maximal value using this formula are choice-worthy.^[My preferred version of GDT adds several more constraints to this - it has a separate constraint for ruling out weakly dominated options, and a constraint for solving beer-quiche games, and maybe a constraint for ruling out mixed strategies in coordination games. But this is a necessary condition for choice-worthiness.] This allows that different options, with different values, could be choice-worthy. All that matters is that given the probability distribution over states
