# The Single Choice Principle

## Equivalence Principles

Each decision tree has an associated strategic decision problem. This section is about when the rational solutions to the two are, in a sense, the same. Making that sense precise takes a bit of care. In a tree, Chooser selects a _sequence_ of moves; in a problem they select a _strategy_. Strategies are more general than sequences; they include what to do at nodes that aren't reached. Say a strategy **extends** a sequence of moves iff the strategy agrees with a sequence of moves iff for every move in the sequence, the strategy says to perform that move if the node the move is at is reached.

For a particular tree-problem pair, say that the pair is *rationally equivalent* iff the following two conditions hold.

- For each sequence of rational moves through the tree, there is some strategy extending that sequence that is a rational play in the problem.
- For each strategy that is a rational move in the problem, there is some sequence of rational moves in the tree which that strategy extends, and such that every move.

Say a set of pairs is rationally equivalent iff every member of the set is rationally equivalent. Then one very general question we can ask is which sets are rationally equivalent. Orthodox decision theory says that the set of pairs where there are no nodes at which Demon moves are rationally equivalent. Buchak's theory denies this. One could try to turn that into an argument against
