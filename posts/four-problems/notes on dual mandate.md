Should highlight Separability as a condition that the Dual Mandate violates.

Bader (2019) https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:eeb20979-e612-4055-b38f-b18ec205900b discusses this without endorsing it
And the Cambridge Elements book (by Texas guy) discusses it

Two advisors
1. Purely dynamic - believes in separability and sophisticated choice.
2. Purely strategic - believes in resolute choice

Dual Mandate view
- Any choice must be permissible according to each of the advisors
- It can be rational to perform acts that are impermissible according to one of the advisors

Is permissibility according to both advisors sufficient
- Yes in two stage cases; no in general
- Would be good to have a case where it fails for 3
