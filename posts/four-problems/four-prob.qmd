title: "Four Problems in Decision Theory"
description: |
  In recent years the literature on decision theory has become disjointed. There isn't as much discussion as there should be on how different problems impact one another. This paper aims to bring together work on problems involving demons, problems about attitudes to risk, problems about incomplete preferences, and problems about dynamic choice. In the first three of these cases, I end up defending a pre-existing view, but in each case the argument for that view is strengthened by seeing how the premises that support it are essential to solving one of the other problems. The most novel part of the view is the theory of dynamic choice that I offer: a sequence of choices is rational only if both the so-called 'resolute' and 'sophisticated' theories of dynamic choice would permit it. This theory would be implausible if paired with many rival solutions to the first three problems, but fits nicely with the view I'll develop through the paper that decision theory is much less constraining than most theorists hold.

Contemporary decision theory has become disjointed. There is less overlap than there should be in working on adjacent problems. This paper aims to undo some of that, by showing that four problems that have largely been worked on in isolation cast useful light on each other. Some of the conclusions that draw will be familiar: Iâ€™m going to defend views similar to those defended by Melissa @Fuscond and by Harvey @Ledermannd. But in each case the arguments will be novel, and I'll end up defending a novel view on dynamic choice.

# Four Problems

## Demons

When a student starts decision theory, they are introduced to a view that is simple, elegant, and wrong. The view says that a chooser, hereafter called Chooser, has a set of possible actions *A* available. We'll use *a* to represent an arbitrary member of that set. And there is a set of possible states *S*, with *s* being used to pick out an arbitrary member. It is assumed that a probability distribution Pr over *S* is given, and that each action-state pair has a numerical value. I'll write *V* for the value function, so *V*(*as*) is the value of performing act *a* in state *s*.

The simple, elegant, and wrong theory is that Chooser should value each act *a* by its expected value, where this is $\sum_{s \in S} \Pr(s)V(as)$. And Chooser should then choose the act with the highest value.

The problem with this view is that if Chooser has any influence over which state is actual, then this view will recommend obviously bad actions. Assume that the only possibly actions are *a* and *b*, the only two states are *s* and *t*, and while *a* will almost certainly cause *s* to be actual, *b* will almost certainly cause *b* to be actual. Now let the payoffs for all four action-state combinations be as in @tbl-joycewindow.

|     | *s* |  *t*  |
|:---:|:---:|:-----:|
| *a* |  1  | 1001  |
| *b* |  0  | 1000  |

: A counterexample to the simple theory {#tbl-joycewindow}

The problem is that in @tbl-joycewindow it obviously makes sense to do *b*, since that brings about the best option, but the simple theory says that the value of *a* is 1 more than the value of *b*. So @tbl-joycewindow is a counterexample to the simple theory. So far every decision theorist would agree. But here agreement ends. There is no agreement on either why the simple theory fails in this case, or what should go in its place.

Evidential decision theorists such as @Ahmed2014 say the problem is that there is an evidential connection between the acts and the states. They say that instead of the simple theory Chooser should value options using this formula.

EDT
:    $V(a) = \sum_{s \in S} \Pr(s|a)V(as)$

The difference is just that instead of the unconditional probability of a state, we use the conditional probability of a state given that the action is performed. This will get the right result in @tbl-joycewindow, but gives some strange results in other cases.

Reinterpret @tbl-joycewindow so that the states are causally independent of the actions, but the actions are evidence for the state. To use the standard example, going back to @Nozick1969, imagine that a demon (hereafter called Demon) has predicted Chooser's choice. There is no backwards causation, so Chooser's choice is causally independent of Demon's prediction. But Chooser believes Demon is incredibly reliable, so $\Pr(s | a) \approx 1$, and $\Pr(t | b) \approx 1$. Then EDT says that Chooser should do *a*, but there is a simple argument that Chooser should do *b*: whatever the world is like, it will have a higher return.

This argument convinced many people
