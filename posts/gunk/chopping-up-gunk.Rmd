Atomism, the view that indivisible atoms are the basic building blocks
of physical reality, has a distinguished history. But it might not be
true. The history of physical science certainly gives many of us pause.
Every time some class of objects appeared to be the entities that Newton
had described as "solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable Particles"
out of which "God in the Beginning formed Matter" [@Newton1952 400],
further research revealed that these objects were divisible after all.
One might be tempted to see that history as confirming Leibniz'
dismissal of atomism as a "youthful prejudice" .[^1] Perhaps material
objects and their parts are always divisible. There are no extended
atoms; nor are there point particles which compose material beings.[^2]

When first presented with this hypothesis, our imaginations are quickly
drawn to picturing the process whereby a quantity of such matter -- call
it gunk \-- is chopped up into smaller and smaller pieces. Prima facie,
there is nothing problematic here: insofar as such a process continues
without end, the initial quantity gets resolves into smaller and smaller
chunks with no limit to the diminution. But suppose this process is
packed into an hour, as imagined by Jose @Bernadete1964 in his 1964
monograph Infinity:

> Take a stick of wood. In 1/2 minute we are to divide the stick into
> two equal parts. In the next 1/4 minute we are to divide each of the
> two pieces again into two equal parts. In the next 1/8 minute we are
> to divide each of the four pieces (for there are now four equal
> pieces) again into two equal parts, &c. *ad infinitum* [@Bernadete1964
> 184].

If matter is divisible without end there seems to be no conceptual
obstacle to each of the divisions. Yet how are we to imagine the
situation at the end of the hour, when the super-task (call it
'super-cutting') has been performed on a quantity of gunk?[^3]

If there were extended atoms that were never annihilated, it is clear
enough what would happen if some super-being undertook to perform
super-cutting: the process would grind to a halt when insurmountably
hard particles resisted the chopper.

If, meanwhile, there were point-sized particles that composed planes
that were as thin as a line, it would be natural to picture the limit of
the process as a sea of separated slivers, each devoid of finite extent
along one dimension. As Benardete, notes, one might then redo
super-cutting in order to finally resolve the original stick into a sea
of "metaphysical motes" devoid of finite extent in any direction:

> At the end of the minute how many pieces of wood will we have laid out

> into an infinite number of metaphysical motes [@Bernadete1964 184-5]

The number of cuts made on the stick, the chip and the splinter
respectively is aleph zero. The number of chips, splinters and motes
left at the end of each cutting process, meanwhile, is aleph one. (Think
of numbering each piece in a super-cutting process by an infinite
expansion of one's and zero's as follows: if it lay on the left of the
first cut, the first numeral is a zero, if to the right, the first
numeral is a one; it if lay on the left of one of the pieces that was
divided at the second round of cutting its second numeral is a zero, if
to the right a one; and so on. For each decimal expansion of one's and
zero's there is a bit and the end with that expansion.). This result is
surprising to some, but poses no deep conceptual confusion. With an
ontology of chips, splinters and motes available to us, there is a
natural description available to us of the limit to the super-cutting
processes described.

But what to say when gunk is subjected to super-cutting? If each
quantity of matter has proper parts, then a sea of metaphysical motes is
not, it would seem, an available outcome. In what follows, we unpack
this puzzle, providing along the way some a priori physics for
gunk-lovers. The problem is only well formed when we make explicit some
of the assumptions that drive it. We do so below:

> 1.  Gunk
>
> Every quantity of matter has proper parts.
>
> 2.  Conservation of Matter:
>
> No mereological sum of quantities of matter can be destroyed by any
> sequence of cuts (though it may be scattered)[^4].
>
> 3.  Occupation
>
> If a quantity of matter occupies a point of space, then there is some
> volume, extended in all dimensions, to which that point belongs which
> that quantity of matter occupies.
>
> 4.  Super-cutting
>
> The laws of the world permit super-cutting.

Note that (1), the thesis that every quantity of matter has parts does
not, by itself, entail any of the other theses. One might also think
that matter sometimes vanishes as a result of some sequence of cuts,
denying (2). One might hold that there are metaphysical splinters (and
perhaps even chips), denying (3). One might hold that any given quantity
of matter does have point sized pieces but that those pieces themselves
have parts (the parts being of the same size as the whole in this case),
denying (3). One might hold that some pieces of gunk can occupy, say, a
spherical region and also a single isolated point at some considerable
distance from the spherical region (while maintaining that no part of it
merely occupies the point), also denying (3). One might imagine that
while always having parts, the parts below a certain thickness are
inseparable, denying (4). One might think there is a minimum amount of
time that any event of separation takes, also denying (4) and so on.

If the gunk hypothesis is maintained, but one or more of (2) to (4) is
jettisoned, there is no problem left to solve. For example: If we are
allowed to suppose that gunk may vanish, then it will be perfectly
consistent to say that nothing is left at the limit of super-cutting. If
we are allowed parts that lack finite extent, then it will be consistent
to adopt Benardete's picture of the outcome. And so on. Our puzzle,
properly formulated is: What would happen if super-cutting occurred in a
world where (1) to (4) are true?

In order to answer that question, we need to supplement Bernadete's
brief discussion of the super-cutting process. It is not immediately
clear from what he says that super-cutting a piece of wood will turn an
object into chips, even assuming the wood to be composed of point
particles. That is a natural description of the limit of the process,
but it is hardly one that is forced upon us by the barebones description
of the process that Benardete provides. When we divide the stick into
two pieces, and then into four pieces, where are we to put these pieces?
Presumably we must ensure that they are separated. If not, it will not
be clear that we really have splinters left at the end. If the stick is
cut into four, but the four pieces are then stored so closely together
that they are not scattered any more, then we will not have four
scattered objects after two rounds of cutting. By extension, unless we
separate the pieces sufficiently after each round (or at least after
sufficiently many of them) then even in a world where matter is composed
of point particles, it is not clear that there will be infinitely many
chips left at the end. Note in this connection that there are limits as
to how far we can separate the objects. In a world where super-cutting
produces chips, we could not, from left to right, put a one inch gap
between each chip and any other, since there are aleph one chips and not
aleph one inches of space along any vector. Nor is it even clear what
kind of spacing will do the trick: how we are to keep aleph one chips
separated from each other? What we need is a formal model showing how
super-cutting is to be performed. Only then can we answer with any
precision what would happen were super-cutting to be performed on gunk.

Assume, for simplicity, that we have a stick that is exactly one inch
long. At the first stage, cut the stick into two 1/2 inch long pieces,
move the left-hand one 1/4 inch leftwards and the right hand one 1/4
inch rightwards. This can be accomplished in 1/2 second without moving
the objects at a speed of faster than 1 inch per second, or accelerating
or decelerating the objects at a rate higher than 4 inches per second
per second.[^5] At the second stage, cut each piece into two, and move
each of the left-hand pieces 1/16 of an inch leftwards, and each of the
right-hand pieces 1/16 of an inch rightwards. So if the original piece
occupied the interval [0, 1) on a particular axis, the four pieces will
now occupy the intervals: [-5/16, -1/16), [1/16, 5/16), [11/16,
15/16), [17/16, 21/16). (The reason we are using these half-open
intervals is to avoid questions about whether the objects that are
separated by the cut used to overlap.) This cutting and moving can be
accomplished in 1/4 of a second, without any piece attaining a velocity
higher than 1/2 inch per second, or an acceleration higher than 4 inches
per second per second.

The third stage of the cutting is to take each of these four pieces, cut
them in two, move the left-hand part of each of the four 1/64 of an inch
to the left, and the right-hand part 1/64 of an inch to the right. So
the eight pieces now occupy the intervals: [-21/64, -13/64), [-11/64,
-3/64), [3/64, 11/64), [13/64, 21/64), [43/64, 51/64),
[53/64, 61/64), [67/64, 75/64), [77/64, 85/64). Again, this cutting
and moving can be accomplished within 1/8 of a second, without any piece
attaining a velocity higher than 1/4 inch per second, or an acceleration
higher than 4 inches per second per second.[^6]

In general, at stage *n*, we take the 2*^n^* pieces, divide each of them
in two, move the left-hand piece 1/2^2^*^n^* inches leftward, and the
right-hand piece 1/2^2^*^n^* inches rightward. This can all be done in
1/2*^n^* seconds without any piece attaining a velocity higher than
1/2*^n^*^-1^ inches per second, or an acceleration higher than 4 inches
per second per second. So the whole super-cut can be performed in 1
second: the first stage in 1/2 second, the second stage in 1/4 second,
the third stage in 1/8 second, and so on. Note, moreover, that the whole
super-cut can be performed in a second without the pieces ever moving at
any huge velocity. If readers doubted the possibility of super-cutting
because they believed it to be a necessary truth that no matters travels
at or beyond the speed of light, their doubts were misplaced: no piece
of matter in the super-cutting process approaches a superluminous
velocity.

Further, in this kind of procedure, a quantity of matter that is
scattered during the super-cutting process remains scattered during the
process. To see this, first consider a particular example. We noted
above that at the second stage there were pieces occupying the intervals
[-5/16, -1/16) and [1/16, 5/16). Before this, the point 0 had been
occupied; at this stage a gap of 1/8 inch around 0 had been opened. This
gap keeps being closed at each stage. After the third stage there were
pieces occupying the intervals [/64, -3/64), [3/64, 11/64), so the gap
is now only 3/32 inch. After the fourth stage, there will be pieces at
[-27/256, -11/256), [11/256, 27/256), so the gap is now only 11/128
inch. This process will make the gap ever smaller, but will not lead to
its closure. As the process continues, the size of the gap will approach
1/12 of an inch, but never cross that boundary. To see this, note that
the size of the gap in inches after stage *n* (*n* ${\geq}$ 3) is
1/8 - 1/2^5^ - 1/2^7^ - ... - 1/2^2^*^n^*. The sum of the series
1/2^5^ + 1/2^7^ + ... is 1/24. Hence the gap at stage *n* is greater
than 1/8 - 1/24 = 1/12. So once the pieces around 0 have been separated,
they will never be rejoined.

This result applies generally to all of the separated pieces in the
super-cut. Once a gap is created, parts of pieces from either side of
the gap are moved ever closer to the centre of the gap at every
subsequent stage of the super-cut. But since we decrease the distance
moved by each piece at each stage of the cut, and in particular decrease
it by a factor greater than 2, the pieces, once disjointed, will never
be united.

How is the matter arranged at the end of the super-cut? To answer this
question we need to assume that motion is continuous. For each part of
the object we can calculate its position function, the function from the
length of time the super-cut has been in progress to the position of the
part. At least, we can calculate this for all times until the end of the
super-cut. With the continuity assumption in place we can infer that its
position at the end of the cut is the limiting value of its position
function. So we make this assumption.

We assumed above that there is a Cartesian axis running along the
object; say that a part *a* covers a point *x* just in case *a* occupies
some region [*y*, *z*), and *y* ${\leq}$ *x* and *z* \> *x*. When we
say *a* occupies [*y*, *z*), we do not mean to imply it occupies only
that region, just that it occupies at least that region. Assume then
that a part *a* occupies a point *x* (0 ${\leq}$ *x* \< 1), and that the
binary representation of *x* is 0.*x*~1~*x*~2~...*x~n~*..., where for
each *x~i~*, *x~i~* equals 0 or 1, and for all *i*, there exists a *j*
\> *i* such that *x~j~* equals zero.[^7] If *x*~1~ = 1, then
*x* ${\geq}$ 1/2, so the some part of *a*, a small part that originally
covered *x*, will be moved rightward at the first stage. It is possible
that *a* itself may be split by the cut, but there will be a small part
around *x* that is not split, and it will move rightward. If *x*~1~ = 0,
then *x* \< 1/2, so some part of *a*, a small part that originally
covered *x*, will be moved leftward at the first stage. Indeed, in
general some part of *a*, a small part that originally covered *x*, will
be moved rightward at the *n*'th stage if *x~n~* = 1, and some part of
*a*, a small part that originally covered *x*, will be moved leftward at
the *n*'th stage if *x~n~* = 0.

Using the fact that a part gets moved 2^-2^*^n^* inches at stage *n*, we
can infer that after *n* stages, a small part that originally covered
*x* and has not been split by the cuts will cover the following point
after *n* cuts.
$$x + \frac{(-1)^{x_1 + 1}}{4} + \frac{(-1)^{x_2 + 1}}{16} + \dots + \frac{(-1)^{x_n + 1}}{2^{2n}}$$

Assuming continuity of motion, we can assume that *a* will end up with a
part that eventually covers the following point, which we will call
*f*(*x*).
$$f(x) = x + \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{x_i + 1}}{2^{2i}}$$

From this, it follows immediately that for all *x* in [0, 1), *f*(*x*)
will end up being occupied. It turns out that these are the *only*
points that are occupied at the end of the super-cut.

Assume that a point *y* is occupied at the end of the super-cut. We will
construct a number *c* such that *y* = *f*(*c*). Recall that we noted
above that whenever two pieces were separated, a gap was created between
them that would never be completely filled. While parts of the stick
would move closer and closer to the centre of that gap during the
super-cut, the middle two-thirds of the gap would never be reoccupied.
That interval, that would never be reoccupied, would be *liberated*. The
interval [1/3, 2/3) is liberated at the first stage, the intervals
[-1/24, 1/24) and [23/24, 25/24) are liberated at the second stage,
the intervals [-37/192, -35/192), [35/192, 37/192), [155/192,
157/192) and [227/192, 229/192) are liberated at the third stage, and
so on. If *y* is occupied, then *y* must not be in any liberated
interval. Therefore it must be either to the left or to the right of any
interval that is liberated.

Let *c*~1~ equal 0 if *y* is to the left of the first liberated
interval, [1/3, 2/3), and 1 otherwise. Given the value of *c*~1~, it is
already determined which side *y* is of one of the intervals liberated
at the second stage. If *y* is to the left of [1/3, 2/3), for example,
then it is to the left of [23/24, 25/24). But the value of *c*~1~ does
not determine which side *y* is of the other interval. Let *c*~2~ equal
0 if *y* is to the left of that interval, and 1 otherwise. The values of
*c*~1~ and *c*~2~ determine which side *y* is of three of the four
intervals liberated at the fourth stage, but leave open which side it is
of one of these four. Let *c*~3~ equal 0 if *y* is to the left of that
interval, 1 otherwise. If we repeat this procedure for all stages, we
will get values of *c~i~* for all *i*. Let *c* be the number whose
binary expansion is 0.*c*~1~*c*~2~...*c~n~*.... It follows that
*y* = *f*(*c*). The reason once it is determined which side *y* is of
each of the liberated intervals, *y* has been determined to fall in an
interval that is exactly one point wide, and *f*(*c*) is in that
interval, so *f*(*c*) must equal *y*. So *y* is occupied iff for some
*x*, *y* = *f*(*x*). Say *S* = {*y*: ${\exists}$*x* (*y* = *f*(*x*))};
the conclusion is that all and only the points in *S* are occupied.

Could a piece of gunk occupy the points in *S*? Not given the
assumptions we have made so far. *S* has two properties that might not
seem consistent at first glance. It is *dense* in the sense that for any
point *y* in *S*, and any distance ${\delta}$, there is another point
*z* in *S* such that *y* - *z* \< ${\delta}$. But it is *disconnected*
in the sense that for any two points *y* and *z* in *S*, there is an
extended region *r* between *y* and *z* that is wholly unoccupied. The
proofs of density and disconnectedness are given in the appendix.

Given (3), disconnectedness is inconsistent with gunk occupying *S*. If
a material object occupies *S*, it must occupy the points in *S*. Let
*y* be any one of these points. By (3), *S* must occupy some extended
region containing *y*, say, [*y*~1~, *y*~2~). Two cases to consider.
First case: *y*~1~ \< *y*. If [*y*~1~, *y*~2~) ${\subset}$ *S*, then
*y*~1~ and *y* are in *S*, and so are all the points in between them.
Since the object occupies *S*, it follows that these points are
occupied. Hence there is no extended region between *y*~1~ and *y* that
is wholly unoccupied, which is inconsistent with disconnectedness.
Second case: *y*~1~ = *y*. Again, [*y*~1~, *y*~2~) ${\subset}$ *S*, and
since this interval is non-empty, *y*~2~ \> *y*~1~. Hence (*y*~1~
+ *y*~2~) / 2 is greater than *y*~1~, and all the points between it and
*y*~1~ are occupied. This is also inconsistent with disconnectedness. So
given (3), no material object could occupy *S*.

In summary, (1) through (4) plus continuity of motion cannot be true
together. From (1), (2), and (4), we inferred that our super-cutting
process was possible, and that it would not destroy any quantity of
matter (though of course it would scatter it). Assuming continuity of
motion, we calculated which points would be occupied after the
super-cut. By (3) we concluded that no piece of gunk could occupy those
points, or indeed any subset of them, yielding an inconsistent result.
Suppose that the continuity of motion thesis is dropped. We can then
maintain (1) to (4) with consistency. One should note, however, that a
world where (1) to (4) holds would be a strange world indeed: if
super-cutting is performed, the pieces of gunk would have to jump
location at the limit. The gunk cannot occupy S: but in order to occupy
a different set of points, various quantities of matter would have to
jump position at the limit.

If one believes in gunk one has a choice: Abandon one or more of (2) to
(4) or else deny that it is nomologically necessary that motion be
continuous. Which assumption should be dropped? We leave it to the gunk
lover to select the most tolerable package. The choice for the gunk
lover is a little unenviable. Those who are attracted to the view that
the actual world is gunky are very much wedded to (1) and (3). When
philosophers take seriously the idea that that matter has parts all the
way down[^8], they do not imagine conjoining that thesis with point
sized parts, or else immaterial parts[^9], or else quantities of matter
that are as thin as a plane, and so on. With a commitment to (1) and (3)
in place, super-cutting will be loaded with physical significance.
Accept that the laws of nature permits super-cutting and one will be
committed to either denying the conservation of matter or the continuity
of motion.

### Appendix  {#appendix .unnumbered}

To prove density, note that if *y* is occupied, there is a point *x*
with binary representation 0.*x*~1~*x*~2~... such that *y* = *f*(*x*).
For any positive ${\delta}$, there is an integer *n* such that
${\delta}$ \> 2^-2^*^n^*. Let *v* be the number represented by
0.*x*~1~*x*~2~...*x~n~x~n~*~+1~$^\prime$*x~n~*~+2~*x~n~*~+3~..., where
*x~n~*~+1~$^\prime$ = 1 iff *x~n~*~+1~ = 0, and *x~n~*~+1~$^\prime$ = 0
otherwise. The difference between *f*(*x*) and *f*(*v*) will be exactly
2^-2^*^n^*^-1^. Since *f*(*v*) is occupied, and *y* = *f*(*x*), there is
an occupied point exactly 2^-2^*^n^*^-1^ inches from *y*, so there is a
point less than ${\delta}$ inches from *y*, as required.

To prove disconnectedness, let *y* and *z* be any two distinct occupied
points. So for some distinct *v*, *x*, *y* = *f*(*x*) and
*z* = *f*(*v*). Say that the binary representation of *x* is
0.*x*~1~*x*~2~..., and the binary representation of *v* is
0.*v*~1~*v*~2~... Let *j* be the lowest number such that
*x~j~* ${\neq}$ *v~j~*. (Since *x* and *v* are distinct, there must be
at least one value *j*.) Without loss of generality, assume that
*x~j~* = 0 and *v~j~* = 1. (There is no loss of generality because we
are just trying to show that between any two occupied points there is a
gap, so it does not matter which of the two points is the rightward
one.) Let *k* be the number with binary representation
0.*x*~1~*x*~2~...*x~j~*1, and let *l*~2~ be *f*(*k*). Finally, define
*l*~1~ by the following equation:
$$l_i = \sum_{i=1}^j \frac{(-1)^{x_i+1}}{2^{2i}} + \sum_{i = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{2i}}$$

It is easy enough to see that *f*(*x*), that is *y*, must be less that
*l*~1~. For *l*~1~ is the value that *f*(*x*) would take were every
digit in the binary expansion of *x* after *j* be 1. But by definition
there must be some value *j*$^\prime$ \> *j* such that
*x~j~*~$^\prime$~ = 0. From this it follows that:
$$\sum_{i = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{2i}} > \sum_{i = j+1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{x_i+1}}{2^{2i}}$$

And from that it follows that *l*~1~ \> *f*(*x*). Indeed, by similar
reasoning, it follows that for all *u* \< *k*, *f*(*u*) \< *l*~1~. Since
*f* is monotone increasing, it also follows that for all
*u* ${\geq}$ *k*, *f*(*u*) ${\geq}$ *l*~2~. And from those facts, it
follows that there does not exist a *u* such that
*f*(*u*) ${\in}$ [*l*~1~, *l*~2~). And since
*y* \< *l*~1~ \< *l*~2~ ${\leq}$ *z*, this implies that there is an
extended unoccupied region between *y* and *z*, as required.

[^3]: What is important, of course, is that the sequence of separations
    occur: it does not matter whether some kind of super-sharp knife is
    responsible for them. In what follows, descriptions of cutting
    sequences can be replaced without loss of content by descriptions of
    separation sequences, leaving it open whether repulsive forces or
    chance events or knives or ... are responsible for the separation
    sequence.

[^4]: The 'can' here is one of nomological possibility.

[^5]: The idea is that in the first quarter second we accelerate the
    object at 4 inches per second per second. This will raise its
    velocity to 1 inch per second, and move the object 1/8 of an inch.
    In the second quarter second we decelerate it at 4 inches per second
    per second, so its velocity ends up at zero, and it ends up having
    moved 1/4 of an inch.

[^6]: Note that, interestingly, if we moved the pieces 1/2 inch after
    the first round, 1/4 inch after the second round, 1/8 inch after the
    third round and so on then at the limit, each left and right edge
    that was once attached will have moved back together again. The
    process we have chosen preserves separation in a way that the
    aforementioned process does not.

[^7]: The final condition is important to rule out numbers having two
    possible representations. For example, we have to choose whether the
    representation of 1/2 should be 0.1000... or 0.0111..., and we
    somewhat arbitrarily, choose the former.

[^8]: See, for example, [@Zimmerman1996].

[^9]: Leibniz, with his monads, is an exception of course. No
    contemporary gunk lover wants a monadology, however.
