title: "Conditionals and Indexical Relativism"
description: |
  I set out and defend a view on indicative conditionals that I call “indexical relativism”. The core of the view is that which proposition is (semantically) expressed by an utterance of a conditional is a function of (among other things) the speaker’s context and the assessor’s context. This implies a kind of relativism, namely that a single utterance may be correctly assessed as true by one assessor and false by another.

This paper is about a class of conditionals that Anthony Gillies (ms)
has dubbed 'open indicatives', that is, indicative conditionals "whose
antecedents are consistent with our picture of the world" (1). I believe
that what I say here can eventually be extended to all indicative
conditionals, but indicatives that aren't open raise special problems,
so I'll set them aside for today. In @Weatherson2001-WEAIAS I argued for
an epistemic treatment of open indicatives, and implemented this in a
contextualist semantics. In this paper I want to give another argument
for the epistemic approach, but retract the contextualism. Instead I'll
put forward a relativist semantics for open indicatives. The kind of
relativism I'll defend is what I'll dub 'indexical relativism'.

</aside>

I've changed my mind since @Weatherson2001-WEAIAS largely because of
developments since I wrote that paper. There have been six primary
influences on this paper, listed here in order that they become relevant
to the paper.

1.  The arguments that Jason Stanley (along with co-authors) puts
    forward in his [-@Stanley2007-STALIC] for the view that all effects
    of context on semantic content are syntactically triggered, and in
    particular involve context setting the value for a tacit or overt
    variable.

2.  John MacFarlane's defences, starting with @MacFarlane2003-MACFCA-2
    of semantic relativism.

3.  John MacFarlane's recent work, including @MacFarlane2009-MACNC at
    distinguishing the view that propositional truth can vary between
    different contexts in the same world, and the view that the truth of
    an utterance can be assessor-sensitive.

4.  Tamina Stephenson's [-@Stephenson2007] arguments in favour of a
    variable PRO~J~ whose value is set by assessors.

5.  Philippe Schlenker's [-@Schlenker2003] idea, modelled on some
    examples from Barbara @Partee1989 that plural variables can be
    'partially bound'.

6.  Anthony Gillies's [-@Gillies2009-GILOTF] suggestions for how to
    explain the acceptability of the 'import-export' schema in an
    epistemic theory of indicative conditionals.

I think it is noteworthy, in light of the claims one sometimes hears
about philosophy not making progress, that most of the building blocks
of the theory defended here weren't even clearly conceptualised at the
time I wrote the earlier paper.

This paper is in seven sections. The paper starts with an argument in
favour of an epistemic treatment of open indicatives, namely that only
the epistemic theory can explain our judgments about inferences
involving open indicatives. The argument isn't completely original,
indeed much of what I'll say here can be found in @Stalnaker1975-STAIC,
but I don't think the scope of this argument has been sufficiently
appreciated. There are a large family of epistemic theories, and in
section two I'll set out some of the choice points that an epistemic
theorist faces. I'll also introduce a fairly simple epistemic theory,
not the one I favour actually, that I'll focus on in what follows. My
preferred theory has several more bells and whistles, but I don't think
those are relevant to the issues about relativism and indexicalism that
I'll focus on here, and including them would just complicate the
discussion needlessly.

In section three I look at four ways a theory could say that the truth
of an utterance type is sensitive to context.[^1] The four ways are
generate by the ways the theory answers two questions. First, is the
truth of the utterance type sensitive to facts about the context of
utterance, as contextualists say, or to facts about the context of
evaluation, as relativists say? Second, does the utterance type express
different propositions in different contexts, as indexicalists say, or
does it express a proposition that takes different truth values in
different contexts, as non-indexicalists say? In using the term
'indexicalist', I'm implicitly assuming the theory, most associated with
Jason @Stanley2007-STALIC , that the way an utterance type can express
different propositions in different contexts is that it has a variable
in its semantic structure, and different contexts assign different
values to this variable.

Three of the four options generated by the two questions, indexical
contextualism, non-indexical relativism, and non-indexical
contextualism, have received some coverage in the literature. The fourth
option, indexical relativism, has not been as widely discussed. In
section four I say a little about its motivations, including its
connection to recent work by Tamina Stephenson. The variable in the
semantics for open indicatives is a plural variable; roughly it takes as
values all those propositions that are known by the salient people in
the context. In section five I note some odd properties about bound
plural pronouns that will become relevant to the story that follows. The
short version is that some plural pronouns can have their values set
partially by antecedent linguistic material, and partially by context.
So if a pronoun *v* refers to the Xs, it might be that *a* is one of the
Xs because *v* is bound to a term that denotes *a*, and *b* is one of
the Xs because *b* is contextually salient in the right kind of way to
be one of the things that *v* denotes.

In section six I put forward the arguments against contextualism, and in
particular against indexical contextualism. I start with some arguments
from 'faultless disagreement', and go through four reasons why these
might not be too strong. I then discuss some arguments from facts about
when two people have said the same thing, or have said different things.
These arguments tell against simple forms of indexical contextualism,
but not against more sophisticated versions. But I conclude with a
somewhat simpler argument, an argument from what I'll call easy
agreement, that does seem to undermine indexical contextualism.

Finally in section seven I'll argue against non-indexical theories of
open indicatives. The primary argument will be that the indexicalist has
a good explanation of what's going on in McGee's 'counterexamples to
modus ponens', an explanation borrowed from some recent work by Anthony
Gillies, but the non-indexicalist does not. The indexicalist's
explanation is that these arguments contain fallacies of equivocation;
on the non-indexicalist position, it is hard to see how they equivocate.
The upshot of the final two sections is that indexical relativism is
correct.

### Inferences Involving Conditionals

I'm going to start by offering an argument for an epistemic treatment of
conditionals. The argument isn't particularly new, I'm basically just
offering an extension of the argument in @Stalnaker1975-STAIC, but I
don't think the force of it has been fully appreciated. The argument
starts with the observation that any instance of any of the following
inference schema seems acceptable when the conclusion is an open
indicative.

1.  *Not A or B*; so, *If A then B*

2.  *All Fs are Gs*; so, *If Fa then Ga*

3.  *f*(*x*) = *f*(*y*); so *If f*(*a*) = *c* *then f*(*b*) = *c*

Here are some instances of each of these inferences.

4.  Either Jack won't come to the party or Jill will; so if Jack comes
    to the party, so will Jill.

5.  All of Kim's students failed; so if Alex was one of Kim's students,
    then Alex failed.

6.  Peter's mother is Paul's mother; so if Peter's mother is Mary,
    Paul's mother is Mary.

Quite a lot has been written about (1)/(4) and I don't propose to
add to it. It is arguable that part of the explanation for its
attractiveness comes from pragmatic properties of disjunctions, and if
that's right it would complicate the story I want to tell here. Instead
I'll focus on the other two inferences.

Jonathan Ichikawa pointed out to me that (3) is not particularly
compelling in cases where it is common ground in the conversation that
*f*(*a*) is not *c*. For instance, it is at least odd to say "Peter's
mother is Jane, and she's also Paul's mother. So Peter's mother is
Paul's mother; so if Peter's mother is Mary, Paul's mother is Mary." I
think intuitions differ on these cases. I don't find the inferences as
bad as many informants do, and generally speaking intuitions about
knowledge-contravening indicatives are rather fuzzy. So I'm just going
to focus on the case where the conclusions are open.

Ernest @Adams1998 has objected to the claim that instances of (2)
always seem like acceptable inferences using the following example.

7.  Everyone who was at the party is a student. So if the Chancellor was
    at the party, the Chancellor is a student. (Adams 1998: 289)

I actually think this sounds like a perfectly fine inference. If I say
that everyone at the party was a student, and someone takes me to
thereby to be committed to the claim that if the Chancellor was at the
party, she too is a student, then I won't complain. But perhaps my
intuitions here are odd. Here is an intuition that I feel more
comfortable with. If the conclusion of (7) is an open indicative, that
is if it isn't ruled out that the Chancellor is a student, then the
inference in (7) sounds perfectly fine to me.

Adams has to object to (2) because it provides counterexamples to a
thesis he defends at some length. This thesis is that an inference from
a single premise to a conditional *If p then q* is a good inference iff
necessarily the probability of *q* given *p* is not lower than the
probability of the premise. Schema (3) is also a problem here as well.
In each case it isn't too hard to find instances where the probability
of the premise is arbitrarily high, but the probability of the
conclusion's consequent given its antecedent is arbitrarily low. For
instance, let the salient probabilities be as below: $$\begin{aligned}
Pr(f(a) = f(b) = d) &= 1-x \\
Pr(f(a) = c \wedge f(b) = e) &= x\end{aligned}$$

If we let *x* be arbitrarily small, then the probability of the premise
*f*(*a*) = *f*(*b*) will be arbitrarily high. But the conditional
probability of *f*(*b*) = *c* given *f*(*a*) = *c* will be arbitrarily
low. So the probability preservation property Adams has highlighted
isn't what is always preserved in good inferences.

Each of the inferences in (1) to (3) is, in some sense, a good
inference. It is easy to prove from that fact, and the assumption that
good inferences are valid implications, that the conditional *If p then
q* is true if *p* is false or *q* is true. If we assume Modus Ponens is
valid (as I will throughout) then we can strengthen this conditional to
a biconditional. It is obviously easy to prove this using the goodness
of (1). Here is a proof that uses just (3), and some weak
assumptions about truth. Line 1 is the only assumption, and every line
seems to follow from the one before it.

1.  The truth value of *p* is the truth value of *p* & *q*

2.  So if the truth value of *p* is true, then the truth value of *p* &
    *q* is true

3.  So if *p* is true, then *p* & *q* is true

4.  So if *p*, then *p* & *q*

5.  So if *p*, then *q*

I've assumed here that we can treat *The truth value of p is true*, *p
is true*, and *p* as equivalent, but this seems uncontroversial. And on
pretty much any conditional logic there is, the move from (4) to (5)
will be valid. Assuming bivalence, (1) is equivalent to the disjunction
*p* is false or *q* is true. So we can infer from that disjunction to
*If p, then q* without using the schema (1).

This might all suggest that open indicatives should be interpreted as
material implications. But there is some data that tells against that.
This suggestion from Richard @Bradley2000 seems correct.

More generally, someone who regards *A* as an epistemic possibility, but
knows that *B* is false, should regard If *A*, *B* also as something
they know to be false. Bradley puts this in probabilistic terms as
follows.

Preservation Condition:

:   If *Pr(A*) \> 0 but *Pr(B*) = 0, then *Pr(A* $\rightarrow$ *B*) = 0

This isn't obviously the best formulation of his principle. In the
example, what matters is not that *A* has non-zero probability, but that
it is something that might be true. (These are different. The
probability that the average temperature in Ithaca on January 1 next
year will be *exactly* 32 degree Fahrenheit is 0, but that might be the
exact temperature.) The structure of the inference looks to be what is
given in (8), where K*p* means the relevant agents knows that *p*.

8.  $\neg$K $\neg$*A*\
    K$\neg$*B*\
    So, K$\neg$(If *A, B*)

But this is not valid if the conditional is a material implication. So
now it is *impossible* to accept all of the intuitively plausible
principles about inference involving conditionals are truth-preserving.
There must be some other explanation of the reasonableness of all these
inferences other than their being valid implications.

The best explanation I know of this 'reasonableness' is the one endorsed
by Daniel @Nolan2003 as an explanation of inferences like (1). Nolan
says that given an epistemic theory of the indicative, we can say that
each of the inferences has the following property. Any speaker who knows
the premise is in a position to truly assert the conclusion. Call an
inference like this, where knowledge of the premise implies truth of the
conclusion, epistemically acceptable. If we are confusing valid
implications with epistemically acceptable inferences, this could
explain why all of (1) through (3) seem reasonable. More
impressively, this hypothesis of Nolan's explains why (8) seems
reasonable, given an epistemic theory of indicatives. If we know that
*A* is true in some epistemic possibilities, but *B* is false in all of
them, then all the epistemically salient alternatives where *A* is true
will be ones where *B* is false. So (8) will turn out to be a good
inference, by Nolan's criteria. So (8), like (1) through (3), is
epistemically acceptable. So given Nolan's epistemic account of
reasonable inference, and an epistemic theory of indicative
conditionals, we can explain the reasonableness of all five problematic
inferences. In the absence of any other good explanation of this
reasonableness, this seems to me to be a good reason to accept both
Nolan's account and an epistemic theory of indicative conditionals.

### The Simple Epistemic Theory of Conditionals

For concreteness, I'll work in this paper with a very simple theory of
conditionals. I assume that in general a conditional *If p*, *q* has the
logical form C(*p*, *q*, X), where C is the conditional relation, and X
is a plural variable that denotes some propositions taken as fixed in
the context. The simple epistemic theory makes two additions to this
basic assumption.

First, there is some epistemic relation R such a proposition *s* is
among the X iff some salient individual *i* stands in relation R to *s*.
We'll use R(*i*) to represent those propositions. It will become
important later that X is genuinely a plural variable, so R(*i*) is not
a set of propositions, or a fusion of propositions (whatever that would
be). Rather, I just mean to be plurally referring to the propositions
that stand in relation R to *i*. (Note that I'm not saying anything here
about how *i* is determined; my preferred theory is that it is the
*evaluator* of any conditional utterance, but nothing in the simple
epistemic theory turns on this.)

A very conservative version of the theory says that R is the knowledge
relation. One can liberalise the theory in two respects. First, we can
say that R is the 'position to know' relation. Second, we can say that
*sRi* iff someone salient to *i* knows that S. A maximally liberal
version of the theory says that *sRi* iff someone salient to *i* is in a
position to know that S. I'm not going to argue for this here, but I
think this maximally liberal option is the way to proceed, so that's
what I'm going to adopt for the sake of exposition. Nothing turns on
this adoption in what follows. Indeed the arguments against
contextualism and for relativism are stronger the more constrained R is,
so this is tilting the playing field away from my preferred outcome.

Second, the simple theory I have in mind says that C is basically just
the a priori entailment relation. So C(*p*, *q*, X) is true iff *p* plus
X a priori entail *q*. If you want to say that entailment is a relation
between a set and a proposition, the claim is that the union of {*p*}
and {*s*: *s* is among the X} a priori entail that *q*.

There are several ways in which one might want to complicate the simple
epistemic theory. My preferred theory involves some of these
complications. Here are some complications that have been proposed in
various ways.

First, we might change C to stipulate that whenever *p* and *q* are
true, C(*p*, *q*, X) is true. This is equivalent to endorsing strong
centring in the sense of @Lewis1973a. Assuming every proposition in X is
true, as I've done above, means that we've already guaranteed that
C(*p*, *q*, X) is false when *p* is true and *q* is false.

Second, we might deny bivalence in the following way. Say that
C(*p*, *q*, X) is true iff *p* and X a priori entail that *q*, false if
it is not true and also *p* and X entail $\neg$*q*, and indeterminate in
truth value otherwise. Going down this path allows one to endorse
conditional excluded middle, as supported by @Stalnaker1981. Denying
bivalence does not compel acceptance of conditional excluded middle, but
it becomes an interesting possibility once you go down this path.

Third, we might say that R is a disjunctive relation, so some
propositions are among the R(*i*) because they stand in an epistemic
relation to *i*, and others are in because they are in some sense 'fixed
facts' of *i*'s world. @Nolan2003 uses a quite different formalism, but
if we wanted to translate his theory into this formalism, that's what
we'd do.

Fourth, we could make C a more complicated relation. In particular, we
could make it in a sense non-monotonic, e.g. by saying that
C(*p*, *q*, X) holds iff the epistemic probability of *q* given *p* and
X is sufficiently high. If C is non-monotonic in this sense, then we can
have a conditional logic that looks like some of the conditional logics
in @Lewis1973a.

For what it's worth, I favour the first and (a version of) the second of
these complications, but not the third and fourth. Defending those
preferences would take us too far afield however. What I mostly want to
show in this paper is that whatever form of epistemic theory we adopt,
we should adopt what I'll call an indexical relativist version of that
theory. So I'll just presuppose the simple epistemic theory throughout,
because the general form of the argument should be easily adoptable
whichever complications one adds on. The task of the next section is to
introduce indexical relativism.

### Four Kinds of Sensitivity

Let's say that one is tempted towards a kind of moral relativism. So
when old Horace, way back when, "Premarital sex is morally worse than
driving drunk" he said something true in some sense, and when modern
Kayla now says "Driving drunk is morally worse than premarital sex", she
also says something true in a sense. How might we formalise these
intuitions? (Not, I might add, intuitions that I share.) There are a few
simple options, breaking down along two distinct axes. To save space,
I'll write P for pre-marital sex, D for driving drunk, and \< for the
relation is morally worse than, in what follows.[^2]

The first axis concerns the nature of propositions about the moral. One
option is to say that moral codes are part of the propositions that are
the content of Horace's and Kayla's utterances. For example, we might
say that when old Horace makes his utterance, its content is the
proposition *P* \< *D in M~O~*, where M~O~ is Horace's old moral code.
Conversely, when Kayla makes her utterance, its content is the
proposition *D* \< *P in M~N~*. where M~N~ is Kayla's new moral code.
This option, as @SayreMcCord1991 notes, treats 'moral' as being like
'legal'. When we say "Insulting the Thai monarch is illegal", the
content of our utterance is the proposition *Insulting the Thai monarch
is illegal in L*, where L is some salient legal code. That's why typical
utterances of that sentence in Bangkok are true, but typical utterances
of it in St Andrews are false. Call this option *indexicalism*, since it
thinks there is an indexical element in the semantic structure of what
Horace and Kayla say. Because this will become crucial later, what I'm
taking to be essential to indexicalism is simply the view that there is
a moral code in the proposition expressed, not that it is the moral code
of the speaker.

A quite different option is to say that the content of Horace's
utterance is simply the proposition *P* \< *D*. The relativism comes in
because it turns out that propositions are true or false relative to,
inter alia, moral codes. The proposition *P* \< *D* is true in M~O~, and
false in M~N~. The analogy here is to the way the very same proposition
can be true in one world false in another. This option, which I'll call
*non-indexicalism*, says that moral codes function much like worlds;
they are things relative to which propositions are true or false. The
non-indexicalist takes @Kaplan1989 to be on the right track in saying
that propositions are true or false relative to world-time pairs, but
thinks that the indices relative to which propositions are true or false
are even more fine-grained than that.

The second axis concerns which context is relevant to the truth of the
utterance. One option is to say that it is the context of utterance. A
second option is to say that it is the context of evaluation. Following
@MacFarlane2007-SMNIC [@MacFarlane2009-MACNC], I'll call the first
option *contextualism*, and the second option *relativism*. The point
that's worth focussing on here is that what choice we make here cuts
across the choice we make on the first axis. So there are four options
available. To set these out, we need to introduce a third character
(call him Deval) who *assesses* Horace's and Kayla's utterances. For
concreteness, call Deval's moral code M~A~, and say that it agrees with
M~N~ on the point at issue. Then here are the four options we have.

-   *Indexical Contextualism*. The propositions that are the content of
    Horace's and Kayla's utteranes include moral codes, and which code
    that is is determined by features of their utterance. So the content
    of Horace's utterance is the proposition *P* \< *D in M~O~*, and
    Kayla's the proposition *D* \< *P in M~N~*. Deval should assess each
    of them as having uttered truths.

-   *Non-indexical Relativism*. The propositions that are the content of
    their utterances do not include moral codes, and their utterances
    are only true or false relative to a moral code provided by an
    assessor. So the content of Horace's utterance is simply *P* \< *D*,
    and Kayla's *D* \< *P*. Since in M~A~ *D* \< *P* is true, Deval
    should assess Horace's utterance as false, and Kayla's as true.

-   *Non-indexical contextualism*. The propositions that are the content
    of their utterances do not include moral codes, but the truth-value
    a moral utterance is the truth-value of its content in the context
    it is expressed in. So the content of Horace's utterance is simply
    *P *\< *D*, and Kayla's *D* \< *P*. Since Horace makes his utterance
    in a context where *P* \< *D* is part of the prevailing moral code,
    his utterance is true. So Deval and Kayla should assess it as true,
    even though they think the proposition Horace expressed is false.
    This isn't contradictory; a person in another possible world can
    make a true utterance by expressing a proposition that is (actually)
    false, and for the non-indexical contextualist, moral codes are in a
    way like worlds. Kayla's utterance is true as well, since it is made
    in a different context.

-   *Indexical relativism*. The propositions that are the content of
    Horace's and Kayla's utteranes include moral codes, and which code
    that is is determined by features of the context of assessment. So
    when Deval hears of these two utterances, he should interpret the
    content of Horace's utterance to be *P* \< *D in M~A~*, and of
    Kayla's to be *D* \< *P in M~A~*. Since the latter proposition is
    true, he should interpret Kayla's utterance as true, and Horace's as
    false.

It might make it easier to picture these positions in a small table, as
follows.

m0.29 \| m0.29 \| m0.29   & The speaker's moral code matters to
utterance truth (contextualism) & The assessor's moral code matters to
utterance truth (relativism) Propositions include moral codes
(indexicalism) & Indexical Contextualism & Indexical Relativism
Propositions are true or false relative to moral codes
(non-indexicalism) & Non-indexical Contextualism & Non-indexical
Relativism

The modern discussion of non-indexical relativism, though not under that
name, traces to @MacFarlane2003-MACFCA-2. The modern discussion of
non-indexical contextualism, under that name, traces to
@MacFarlane2007-SMNIC [@MacFarlane2009-MACNC]. Much of this paper, and
all of this section, is about setting out the distinctions that
MacFarlane makes in the latter papers between indexicalism and
contextualism. But once we do that, we see that there is a position,
indexical relativism, that hasn't had much attention. I plan to change
that.

Before we get on to the content of indexical relativism, a small note on
nomenclature is in order. I've picked the names I have so (a) we'll have
a compositional naming scheme and (b) we get 'non-indexical
contextualism' to denote what it denotes in MacFarlane's terminology.
This does mean using the term 'indexical relativism' in a slightly
different way to how it has been used in the part. @Einheuser2008 and
@LopezDeSaMs each use 'indexical relativism' to mean just what I've
meant by 'indexical contextualism'. @Kolbel2004 also uses the term
'indexical relativism', though @LopezDeSa2007a argues that he too just
means contextualism, and I'm inclined to agree. So though the name had
been previously used, it had not been used to express a distinctive
view.

On the other hand, there had been some discussions of the position I'm
calling 'indexical relativism'. In @Egan2005-EGAEMI we call such a
position 'content relativism', though @Cappelen2008 uses that term for a
slightly different position. In @MacFarlane2005-MACMSO he discusses
'assessment indexicality', a property sentences have if they express
different propositions in different contexts. So there doesn't seem to
be a settled terminology for this corner of the table, and I propose to
take 'indexical relativism' for it.

### Indexical Relativism

In "Judge Dependence, Epistemic Modals, and Predicates of Personal
Taste", Tamina Stephenson proposes a variant on Peter Lasersohn's
[-@Lasersohn2005] relativist account of predicates of personal taste.
Stephenson proposes that predicates of personal taste always encode
relations between an object and an assessor. So when we say "Warm beer
is tasty" we express some proposition of the form *Warm beer is tasty to
X*. So far, this is not particularly new. What is interesting is
Stephenson's suggestion that some of the time (but not always) there is
a 'silent nominal' PRO~J~, whose value is the 'judge'. So the utterance
will be true as judged by *y* iff warm beer is tasty to *y*. There are
several advantages to positing a tacit parameter. One that Stephenson
stresses is that in some cases, e.g. when we are talking about the
tastiness of various brands of cat food, we can let the value of this
parameter be the cat rather than any human. But, by letting it by
default take the value PRO~J~, Stephenson shows that we can accommodate
most of the intuitions that motivate Lasersohn's relativism.

Now Stephenson is not an indexical relativist, as I've defined that
position. For according to the indexical relativist, propositions are
only true or false relative to worlds. And Stephenson has propositions
be world-time-judge triples. But I think we can adopt her idea to set
out a kind of indexical relativism. I'll first say how this could go in
the moral case, then apply it to conditionals.

The moral indexical relativist says that the context-neutral content of
an utterance like Kayla's is not a complete proposition. Rather, it is a
propositional frame that we might express as *D* \< *P* *in M(PRO~J~*),
where M(*x*) is *x*'s moral code, and PRO~J~ is (as always) the judge.
Relative to any judge, the content of her utterance is that *D* \< *P*
in that judge's moral code. So relative to Horace, the content of her
utterance is the false proposition *D* \< *P* *in M~O~*, and relative to
Deval it is the true proposition *D* \< *P* *in M~A~*. That's why it is
fine for Horace to say "I disagree", or "That's false", or "She speaks
falsely", and fine for Deval to say "I agree", or "That's true", or "She
speaks truly". Now I reject any kind of moral relativism, so this isn't
my theory for moral language, but it's a theory that could in principle
work.

What I will defend is indexical relativism for indicative conditionals.
In general, the content of an indicative conditional *If p*, *q* is
C(*p*, *q*, X), where the propositions in X are the 'background'
propositions relative to which the conditional is assessed, and C is the
conditional relation[^3]. An epistemic theory of indicatives says that
the value of X is (by default) *R(x*), where *r* is some epistemic
relation (on a broad construal of 'epistemic') and *x* is a salient
individual. The indexical relativist position is that the content of an
utterance of a conditional is (by default) a propositional frame that we
might express as C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)). Relative to an assessor *a*,
the content is C(*p*, *q*, *R(a*)).

The argument for this position will come in sections 6 and 7. In section
6 I'll argue against indexical contextualism. The argument will be that
if indexical contextualism were true, it should be harder to *agree*
with an utterer of a conditional than it actually is. Then in section 7,
I'll argue for indexicalism. The argument will be that we need to posit
the third argument place in the conditional relation to explain what
goes wrong in some arguments that are alleged to be both instances of
modus ponens and invalid. I'll argue (not particularly originally) that
these arguments involve a shift of a tacit parameter, namely X. This
suggests that X exists. Between those two arguments, we can conclude
that indexical relativism is true. Before that, I want to look at some
arguments against indexical relativism.

In @Egan2005-EGAEMI we mention two arguments against this position. One
is that indexical relativism is incompatible with a Stalnakerian account
of the role of assertion. Assertions, we said, are proposals to add
something, namely their content, to the context set. But if the content
of an assertion is different in different contexts, then it is
impossible to add *it* to the context set. And that, we thought, was a
problem. I now think there's a relatively simple way around this.[^4] If
you want to add a proposition to the context set, then there has to be a
context. And relative to any context, a conditional does have a content.
So given any context, the content of the conditional (relative to that
context) can be added to the context set. And that's all the
Stalnakerian account requires.

Perhaps a stronger version of this objection is that even if you can
figure out, given the rules, what move a speaker is making according to
this theory, this isn't a move that sensible speakers should want to
make. So imagine that A says that if *p*, then *q*, and says this
because they have just discovered something no one else knows, namely
$\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*). Now B hears this, not because A tells her, but
because of a fortuitous echo. B takes A to be expressing the proposition
C(*p*, *q*, *R*(*B*)), and proposing that it be added to the context
set. But that's a terrible proposal, we might object, because A has no
reason to know that C(*p*, *q*, *R*(*B*)), since she knows nothing about
B's knowledge. Since there is nothing wrong with A's utterance, and the
theory interprets her as making an indefensible proposal to add
something to the context set, the theory is wrong.

This objection is potentially a powerful one, and any version of
indexical relativism must say something about such an objection. What I
say is that the objection misconstrues *R*(*B*). If *B* is considering
an utterance by *A*, even if *B* does not know that *A* is the author of
that utterance, then any proposition that *A* knows is among the
*R*(*B*). I think this holds quite generally. If *A* knowably asserts
that *p*, and *B* considers it and says "That might not be true", what B
says is false, even if *B* does not know whether *p* is true. The reason
is that *B* is taking *A*'s knowledge to be, for the time being,
relevant to the context of her utterance. So in short, the knowledge on
which *A* relies for her utterance is carried in to every context in
which that very utterance is assessed. That's why it is acceptable for
*A* to make such a sweeping proposal, namely that for every *x* who
evaluates her utterance, C(*p*, *q*, *R*(*x*)) should be added to the
common ground of *x*'s context. This response relies heavily on specific
features of the interaction between conditionals and context, and I
don't think it generalises very far. It may be that this style of
objection does defeat some prima facie plausible versions of indexical
relativism, though it does not touch indexical relativism about open
indicatives.

A related objection, to a quite different proposal, is made in
@KingStanley2005. They oppose the theory that the semantic content of an
utterance is something like a character. They say the content has to be
a proposition, and the reason for this is that "Our understanding of a
sentence in a context is due to a compositional procedure that
calculates the content of the whole sentence from the referential
contents of its parts." This seems like a good reason for not taking the
semantic content of a sentence in general to be its character. And we
might worry that it could be extended to an argument against the view
that the content of a conditional is a function from contexts of
assessment to propositions. But on closer inspection it seems like no
such generalisation is possible. After all, someone interpreting a
conditional *can* assign a value to the variable X that takes different
values in different contexts of assessment. They can just 'replace'
PRO~J~ with themselves when interpreting the conditional. The important
point here is that the view that the utterance does not have a
context-neutral semantic content is consistent with it having a content
relative to any interpreter, and hence to interpreters discovering its
content (relative to them).

The other objection we made to indexical relativism in the earlier paper
was that it left as unexplained some phenomena about the behaviour of
epistemic modals in propositional attitude reports that the
non-indexical theory could explain. I still think this is an advantage
of the non-indexical theory, but I don't think it is decisive. (In
general, it isn't a deal breaker that one theory has to take as a brute
fact something that a rival theory explain, although it does count in
favour of the rival.) I'll say more about this objection when we discuss
propositional attitude reports in more detail in section 6. But first, I
need to introduce some facts about the behaviour of plural pronouns that
my indexical relativist theory will exploit.

### Partial Binding

Philosophical orthodoxy has it that all pronouns fall into one of two
broad categories. On the one hand, there are deictic pronouns, whose job
it is to refer (presumably directly) to a contextually salient object.
On the other hand, there are pronouns whose job it is to denote (one way
or another), an object denoted earlier in the discourse. Examples of the
latter kind include the tokens of 'she' in (5.1) to (5.3).

1.  If Suzy enters the competition, **she** will win.

2.  Every student will get the grade that **she** deserves.

3.  If a dictator has a daughter, **she** is pampered by the state.

I'm not going to go into the (very interesting) debates about how many
different kinds of pronouns are represented by the three tokens of 'she'
above, nor about which of these pronouns are directly referential, which
are quantifiers, and which are neither of these. All I want to note is
that the pronouns represented here fall into a different category than
simple deictic pronouns, that refer to a contextually salient
individual.

Thomas [@McKay2006 Ch. 9] has argued that the behaviour of plural
pronouns mirrors the behaviour of singular pronouns. He shows that for
every different kind of singular pronoun we can find, or even purport to
find, we can find plural pronouns behaving the same way. The following
three sentences, which are about a film school where girls make films in
large groups, have pronouns that behave just like the three tokens of
'she' above.

4.  If some girls enter the competition, **they** will win.

5.  Some students will produce a better film than we expect **them** to.

6.  If a student dislikes some girls, **their** work suffers.

What is quite noteworthy about plural pronouns, however, is that they
need not fall into one of the two major categories I mentioned at the
start of the section.[^5] It is possible to have a plural pronoun whose
denotation is determined partially by context, and partially by the
denotation of earlier parts of the discourse. Consider, for example,
(5.7), as uttered by Jason.

7.  If Ted comes over, we'll go and get some beers.

It seems the 'we' there denotes Ted and Jason. It denotes Jason because
it's a first-person plural pronoun, and Jason is the speaker, and the
speaker is always among the denotata of a first-person plural pronoun.
Arguably, the 'we' is anaphoric on 'Ted', but this does not mean it
denotes only Ted. Rather, it means that Ted is among the denotata of
'we', the others being determined by context. One might object that
really 'we' in (5.7) is deictic, and Ted is among its denotata because
he has been made salient. I think that's probably a mistake, but I don't
want to press the point. Rather, I'll note some other cases where such
an explanation is unacceptable. The following example, due to Jeff King
(p.c.) shows that 'we' can behave like a donkey pronoun.

8.  If any friend comes over, we'll go and get some beers.

Intuitively that's true, as uttered by Jason, just in case for some
salient class of friends, if any member of that class comes over, Jason
and that friend will go and get beers. Now it is controversial just how
to account for donkey pronouns in general, and I'm not going to take a
side on that. But however they work, donkey pronouns seem to fall on the
second side of the divide I mentioned at the top of the section. And
first person singular pronouns are paradigmatic instances of pronouns
that get their reference from context. What's notable is that
first-person plural pronouns can display both kinds of features.

This is not a particularly new point. Example (5.9) was introduced by
Barbara Partee in 1989, and there is a longer discussion of the
phenomena by Phillipe Schlenker in his [-@Schlenker2003]. The latter
paper is the source for (5.10) and (5.11).

9.  John often comes over for Sunday brunch. Whenever someone else comes
    over too, we (all) end up playing trios. @Partee1989

10. Each of my colleagues is so difficult that at some point or other
    we've had an argument. @Schlenker2003

11. [Talking about John] Each of his colleagues is so difficult that
    at some point or other they've had an argument. @Schlenker2003

Schlenker describes what is going on here as 'partial binding', and I'll
follow his lead here. The 'we' in (5.10) is bound to the earlier
quantifier phrase 'Each of my colleagues', but, as above, this does not
mean that it merely denotes (relative to a variable assignment) one of
the speaker's colleagues. Rather, it denotes a plurality that includes
the colleague, and includes the speaker. And the speaker is supplied as
one of the denotata by context.

The reason for mentioning all this here is that my theory of how
conditionals behave involves, among other things, partial binding. The
general semantic structure of a conditional is C(*p*, *q*, X), where X
is a plural variable that denotes some propositions. I think X can,
indeed often is, partially bound. In simple cases a proposition is among
the X just in case it stands in relation *R* to a salient individual
*i*. In more complex cases, X is partially bound to an earlier phrase,
and in virtue of that some proposition *s* is among the X. But the
propositions that stand in relation *R* to *i* are also among the X,
because X is only partially bound to the earlier proposition. If there
were no other instances of partial binding in natural language, this
would be a fairly ad hoc position to take. But there shouldn't be any
theoretical problem with assuming that tacit variables can behave the
way that overt pronouns behave.

### Against Indexical Contexualism

One usual way to argue for relativist theories is to appeal to instances
of faultless disagreement. It is natural to think that such arguments
could work in the case of open indicatives. Since Gibbard (1981) there
has been a lot of discussion over cases where A knows $\neg$(*p* &
$\neg$*q*), and B knows $\neg$(*p* & *q*). It seems A can truly, even
knowledgeably, say *If p, q*, and B can truly, even knowledgeably, say
*If p,* $\neg$*q*. And, in the right context, it might seem that this is
a case where A and B disagree. One might try and argue that the only way
to explain this faultless disagreement between A and B is through some
variety of relativistic semantics. I think that will be a hard argument
to make out for four reasons.

First, some people hold that the notion of a faultless disagreement is
incoherent. I suspect that's wrong, and the concept is coherent, but
making this argument stick would require showing that faultless
disagreement is indeed coherent. I want the argument for indexical
relativism about open indicatives to not rely on the coherence of
faultless disagreement.

Second, two people can disagree without there being any proposition that
one says is true and the other is false. (This should be familiar from
debates about non-cognitivism in ethics.) If A says "I like ice cream"
and B says "I don't like ice cream", then there is a natural sense in
which they are disagreeing, for instance. But arguments from
disagreement for relativism generally require that when two people
disagree, there is a proposition that one accepts and the other rejects,
and that may not be true.

Third, there is some special reason to think that this is what happens
in the conditionals case. In this case A and B are having a
*conditional* disagreement. Perhaps we intuit that A and B are
disagreeing merely because of this conditional disagreement. For
comparison, if A and B had made a conditional bet, we would describe
them as having made a bet in ordinary discourse, even if the bet is not
realised because the condition is not satisfied.

Finally, as @Grice1989 showed, there can be cases where we naturally
describe A and B as disagreeing in virtue of two utterances, even though
(a) those utterances are simple assertions, and (b) the assertions are
consistent. Grice's case is where A says that *p* or *q* is true, and B
says that *p* or *r* is true, with stress on *r*, where *q* and *r* are
obviously incompatible. Perhaps the natural thing to say here too is
that A and B have a conditional disagreement; conditional on $\neg$*p*,
A thinks that *q* and B thinks that *r*. So this argument seems to need
a lot of work.

An apparently stronger argument comes from indirect speech reports. It
seems that in any case where a speaker, say Clarke, says "If the doctor
didn't do it, the lawyer did", then in any other context, we can report
that by saying "Clarke said that if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer
did." This might look to pose a problem for indexical contextualism.

Assuming that the content of *If p, q* is C(*p*, *q*, *R(i*)), where *i*
is some person made salient by the context of utterance. Let *p* be *The
doctor didn't do it*, and *q* be *The lawyer did it*, *c* be Clarke, and
*h* be the person who reports what Clarke said. Then it seems that what
Clarke said is C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). But it seems that the content of
what comes after the *that* in the report is C(*p*, *q*, *R(h*)). But
since *R(c*) might not be the same as *R(h*), this should look like a
bad report.

I think this is something of a problem for the indexical contextualist,
but it isn't beyond repair. It could be that the variable *i* in the
speech report is bound to the name at the start of the report, so the
value of *i* in *Clarke said* C(*p*, *q*, *R(i*)) is simply Clarke
herself. This is a slightly odd kind of binding, but it isn't
impossible, so this doesn't quite rule out a contextualist theory.

As @MacFarlane2009-MACNC argues, the felicity of homophonic reports does
not raise a problem for either kind of non-indexical theory. I'll argue
that it also doesn't pose a problem for indexical relativism.

The indexical relativist thinks that, on its most natural
interpretation, the content of Clarke's utterance is C(*p*, *q*,
*R(*PRO~J~)). Similarly, it might be thought that the natural
interpretation of what comes after the *that* in the report is C(*p*,
*q*, *R(*PRO~J~)). So it isn't surprising that the report is acceptable.

I can imagine an objector making the following speech. "Assume that
Clarke's utterance was sincere. Then it seems natural to say that Clarke
believes that if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did. But it is odd
to think that Clarke believes C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)). What she
believes is C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). The only way to get belief reports to
work on the indexical contextualist theory is to insist that the *i* is
bound to the subject of the report. But once you say that it is ad hoc
to deny that the *i* is also bound to the subject in a speech report.
And not just ad hoc, it implies that (relative to our context) Clarke
doesn't believe what she says, for she says C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)) but
believes C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). On the other hand if the *i* is bound to
the speaker in a speech report, so what Clarke is said to have said is
C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)), then (a) you have no advantage over the indexical
contextualist, and (b) you can't explain why the report is felicitous,
since you say she says something else, namely C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~))."

I have three responses to this critic. The first is that I'm not
convinced that having a different treatment of belief reports and speech
reports, letting *i* be PRO~J~ in speech reports and the believer in
belief reports, is too terrible. The argument that it would be ad hoc to
treat speech reports and belief reports separately seems weak. It is
worse if we end up, because of the structure of the theory, accusing
Clarke of insincerity. One way of avoiding that response is to accept
the binding proposal. But it isn't the only way. If we make two
assumptions about C and *R*, we can sidestep the danger.

The first assumption is that C is monotonic in the sense that
C(*p*, *q*, X + Y) is entailed by C(*p*, *q*, X). The second is that
*xRp* is true in case someone salient to *x* bears *R* to *p*, and the
utterer of the judged sentence is salient (in this sense) to the judge.
(Note this is exactly the assumption that I made earlier to defend my
proposal about what effect uttering a conditional has on the
Stalnakerian context.) Now not all indexical relativists will want to
make these assumptions, but I'm happy to do so. Now if Clarke believes
*If p*, *q*, she believes C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). So she either believes
she knows $\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*), or believes she knows some things
that (perhaps unbeknownst to her) entail it. That means that, whoever
the judge of her utterance is, she believes that *R*(PRO~J~) either
includes or entails $\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*). So she believes C(*p*, *q*,
*R(*PRO~J~)), as required.

So I don't think the indexical relativist has to concede to the critic
that speech reports involve binding in this way. But I might be wrong
about this, so my second and third responses concede this point, and
argue that it doesn't harm the indexical relativist position.

The second response is that even with this concession, the indexical
relativist has a small advantage over the indexical contextualist.
Drawing on Stephenson's work, we could argue that (a) PRO~J~ is often
the value of a tacit variable, and (b) whenever it is the default value
of a variable, then that variable is bound to the subject of a
propositional attitude report. If that is the case, then the indexical
relativist could unify a number of different cases that would have to be
treated separately by the indexical contextualist. Still, it is true
that the non-indexicalist has an even larger advantage here, since they
can explain why this (apparent) binding holds, but I don't think this
advantage is decisive. This is the one argument for non-indexicalism
that I mentioned in section 4 might still have some force, though not I
think enough to override the argument for indexicalism in the next
section.

The third response is that the indexical relativist has a simple
explanation of why the reports are natural, even on the assumption that
the *i* is bound to the speaker. First consider a similar case. Imagine
Clarke had simply said "The lawyer did it", i.e. *q*. It would be
natural to report her as having said that the lawyer actually did it.
Now one can imagine being surprised at this. Clarke said something
contingently true, but we reported her using a proposition *that the
lawyer actually did it*, that is necessarily true. How is this possible?
Well, it is because in saying *q*, she immediately and obviously commits
herself to *Actually q*, and if a speaker immediately and obviously
commits themselves to a proposition in virtue of an utterance, then it
is natural to report them as having said that proposition. Speakers are
generally committed to the truth of the utterances from their own
perspective, so Clarke is committed to C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). (Arguably
that is all she is committed to, as opposed to C(*p*, *q*,
*R(*PRO~J~)).) So we can report her as having said C(*p*, *q*,
*R(*PRO~J~)). And if *i* is bound to the speaker, that is what we do
report her as having said by saying "Clarke said that if the doctor
didn't do it, the lawyer did."[^6]

So both the argument from disagreement and the argument from speech
report against indexical contextualism have run up against some blocks.
There is another argument, however, that is effective against it. This
is an argument from easy agreement. Assume again that Clarke said "If
the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did." Assume that an arbitrary
person, call him Rebus, knows that Clarke made this utterance, and knows
that either the doctor or the lawyer did it, that is knows that
$\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*). On that basis alone, it will be natural for
Rebus to make any of the following utterances. "I agree"; "That's
right"; "That's true"; "What she said is true"; "She spoke truly". Any
of these are hard to explain on the indexical contextualist view,
according to which agreement should be harder to get than this.

On the indexical contextualist view, Clarke said C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)).
Now on most accounts of what *r* is, Rebus need not know that $\neg$(*p*
& $\neg$*q*) is one of the propositions in *R(c*). He need not know that
Clarke know this, or that Clarke could have known this, or really
anything else. As long as he knows that Clarke made this utterance, it
seems acceptable for him to agree with it using any of the above
formulations.

There are two ways that the indexical contextualist might try to explain
this agreement. First, they could try to argue that it is acceptable for
Rebus to agree with Clarke's utterance despite not agreeing with the
propositional content of it. Second, they could try to argue that it is
the case, in any case fitting the above description, that he agrees with
the propositional content of what Clarke said.

The first approach does not seem particularly attractive. Not only does
it seem theoretically implausible, it is hard to find independent reason
to believe that this is how agreement works. Generally if a speaker
utters some term with a contextually sensitive term in it, then another
speaker will not agree with the utterance unless they agree with the
proposition we get by filling in the appropriate value for the
contextually sensitive term. Or, perhaps more precisely, they will not
accept all five of above forms of agreement.

This is how agreement works when the utterance contains an explicit
indexical like 'I'. Note that if Clarke had said "I like Hibs", Rebus
could say "I agree" if he too likes Hibs. But he couldn't have said, for
instance, "What she said is true" unless Clarke liked Hibs. This is why
the variety of forms of agreement matters. Perhaps more contentiously, I
think this is also what happens when the original utterance involves
quantifiers with tacit domain restriction, or comparative adjectives
with tacit comparison classes, or modals, or any other kind of context
sensitive language. So the indexical contextualist should look at a
second option.

The second option is to say that the proposition Rebus knows, $\neg$(*p*
& $\neg$*q*), will be one of the *R(c*). There are two ways to do this.
First, we could say that *R(c*) includes all propositions that are known
by anyone, so as long as Rebus knows $\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*), it is one
of the *R(c*). But this just about reduces back to the material
implication theory of indicatives, since any conditional will be true as
long as anyone knows the corresponding material implication. And that is
implausible. Second, we could say that *R(c*) includes any proposition
known by anyone who hears *c*'s utterance. That would again ensure that
$\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*) is one of the *R(c*). But again, it is fairly
implausible. For one thing, it doesn't *seem* that the truth of the
conditionals I'm writing in this paper depend on how wide a readership
the paper has. For another, under some assumptions this again collapses
into the material implication theory. Assume that there is an omniscient
deity. Then for any conditional *If p*, *q*, the deity's knowledge is
among *R(c*), and if $\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*) is true, then it is one of
the *R(c*). But then *If p*, *q* will be true, which was not what we
wanted. Now we don't know that there is an omniscient deity, but it
seems reasonable to require that our semantic theories be at least
consistent with the existence of such a deity.

So I think the indexical contextualist has no explanation of this
agreement phenomena. But the indexical relativist has no such problem.
When Clarke's utterance is being judged by Rebus, it expresses the
proposition C(*p*, *q*, *R(*Rebus)), so $\neg$(*p* & $\neg$*q*) is
clearly one of the propositions in the third clause. That's why
agreement with another's utterance of a conditional is so easy.

Similarly there is no problem for a non-indexical relativist. It is a
little trickier to know whether there is a problem here for the
non-indexical contextualist. It is easy to see why many of the locutions
Rebus could use are acceptable. Rebus does, after all, accept the
proposition that Clarke expresses, namely C(*p*, *q*). The only
complication concerns "She spoke truly." There is a sense in which
that's not really true. After all, the non-indexical contextualist
thinks that Clarke's *utterance* was false, since they think that an
utterance is true iff the proposition it expresses is true in its
context. If we think, as probably isn't compulsory, that "She spoke
truly" means what the theorist means by saying the utterance is true,
then there is a problem for the non-indexical contextualist.

Setting aside those complications, what is clear is that the phenomena
of agreement raises a problem for the indexical contextualist, and not
for the relativist. We can put the problem another way. If indexical
contextualism is true, it should be possible for Rebus to say "Clarke's
utterance "If the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did" was not true, but
if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did." Again, this seems like it
should be possible on theoretical grounds, and it is possible for most
contextually sensitive sentences. But this doesn't seem to be a coherent
speech on Rebus's part. This is of course just another manifestation of
the phenomena that agreement with conditionals is easy. If Rebus accepts
that if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did, then he accepts that
Clarke's utterance was true. The indexical contextualist can't explain
this, so indexical contextualism is false.

### Against Non-Indexicalism

The argument for an indexicalist account of indicatives is that they
allow an elegant account of what is going on in apparent counterexamples
to modus ponens, such as the cases due to Vann @McGee1985. What these
cases turn on is that right-embedded conditionals, like *If p, then if
q, r* seem equivalent, in some sense, to conditional with conjunctive
antecedents, in this case *If p and q*, *r*. Given this equivalence, and
the triviality of *If p and q, p and q*, we get the result that (7.1) is
trivial.

1.  If *p*, then if *q*, *p* and *q*

And if (7.1) is genuinely trivial, then a number of awkward consequences
follow. Perhaps the worst of these consequences is that we seem to get
counterexamples to modus ponens. Let *p* be some truth that isn't
knowable. Since (7.1) is trivial, it is true. And by hypothesis *p* is
true. But on pretty much any epistemic theory of conditionals, *If q*,
*p and q* will not be true. So we have counterexamples to modus ponens.
(This is more like McGee's 'lungfish' example than the more widely cited
example about the 1980 election, but the structure I think is basically
the same, and the solution I offer will generalise to all these cases.)

What I'm going to say about these cases borrows heavily from some
remarks by Anthony @Gillies2009-GILOTF. Gillies makes two observations
that point towards a solution to the puzzle McGee's cases raise.

First, we cannot in general *assert* both of the premises, namely (7.1)
and *p*, in contexts where the conclusion, namely *If q*, *p and q* is
not assertable. This might need to be qualified in cases where people
don't know what they can assert, but it is largely right. As Gillies
demonstrates by close attention to the cases, some kind of context shift
between the premises and conclusion is needed in order to assert the
conclusion after the premises have been asserted.

Second, there are many reasons to believe that part of what why (7.1)
seems trivial is that we evaluate its consequent relative to a context
in which *p* is taken to be part of the evidence. Gillies formalises
this by having the antecedent play two separate roles, first as a
constituent of the conditional uttered, and second as a context-modifier
relative to which the consequent is interpreted. The formal theory I'm
building here is quite different to Gillies' because of very different
starting assumptions, but I will adopt Gillies' idea to the framework
I'm using.

Despite Gillies' first observation, there are still three reasons to
take seriously the challenge McGee's cases raise. Two of these involve
using modus ponens under the scope of a supposition, and the third
involves agents who don't know what they know. The first problem
concerns the following implication.

  -------- ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------
     \(1\) If *p*, if *q*, *p* and *q*                            Premise
     \(2\) If $\neg$*p*, if *q*, $\neg$*p* and *q*                Premise
     \(3\) *p* or $\neg$*p*                                       Logical truth
     \(4\) *p*                                                    Assumption for argument by cases
     \(5\) If *q*, *p* and *q*                                    Modus Ponens, 1, 4
     \(6\) (If *q*, *p* and *q*) or (If *q*, $\neg$*p* and *q*)   Or introduction, 5
     \(7\) $\neg$*p*                                              Assumption for argument by cases
     \(8\) If *q*, $\neg$*p* and *q*                              Modus Ponens, 2, 7
     \(9\) (If *q*, *p* and *q*) or (If *q*, $\neg$*p* and *q*)   Or introduction, 8
    \(10\) (If *q*, *p* and *q*) or (If *q*, $\neg$*p* and *q*)   Argument by cases, 3, 4-6, 7-9
  -------- ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------

But on the simple epistemic theory we've been using here, (10) will not
be true in cases where the truth value of *p* is unknown, even though it
seems to follow from two trivialities and a logical truth. (I'm assuming
here either that classical logic is correct, or that *p* is decidable.)
Now it might be noted here that on some theories, particularly those
that follow @Stalnaker1981 in accepting conditional excluded middle,
(10) will be true. But even on those Stalnakerian theories, there will
be cases where neither disjunct of (10) will be determinately true. And
we can rerun a version of this argument, taking as premises that (1),
(2) and (3) are determinately true, to derive as a conclusion that one
or other disjunct is determinately true.

The third reason is similar to the second. We can use modus ponens in
the scope of a reductio proof. Or, more colloquially, we can use modus
tollens. But the following argument does not look to be particularly
compelling.

  ------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------------
    \(1\) If *p*, if *q*, *p* and *q*                   Premise
    \(2\) It is not the case that if *q*, *p* and *q*   Premise
    \(3\) Not *p*                                       Modus Tollens, 1, 2
  ------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------------

It may be objected that modus tollens is more controversial than modus
ponens. But since we can derive it using just modus ponens and reductio
ad absurdum, this objection looks weak. So this would be a bad result.

It might be thought best to say here that modus ponens doesn't preserve
truth, but it does preserve knowledge. If a subject is in knows each
premise, they can know the conclusion. But that doesn't seem right
either, though the cases are slightly obscure. Assume a perfectly
rational S knows that *p*, but does not know that she knows that *p*,
and in fact for all she knows she knows, *q* and $\neg$*p* is true.
Again assuming (7.1) is trivial, she knows it, and she knows that *p*,
but on an epistemic interpretation of the conditional, she won't know
*If q*, *p and q*, since she doesn't know she knows that *p*.

So there is a serious problem here. Once we accept that (7.1) is
trivial, a lot of unfortunate consequences follow for the epistemic
theory of conditionals. Any explanation of why (7.1) seems trivial will,
I think, have to start with Gillies' insight that when we interpret
(7.1), we evaluate its consequent relative to a context where *p* is
taken as given. How might we do this? Three options spring to mind.

The first option is Gillies' theory is that it is part of the meaning of
the conditional that its consequent be interpreted relative to a context
where its antecedent is part of the background information. That has the
nice result that (7.1) is indeed trivial. It seems, however, to lead to
all the problems mentioned above. Gillies' response to these is to
develop a new theory of validity, which has the effect that while modus
ponens is itself valid, it can't be used inside the scope of
suppositions, as I frequently did above. This is a very interesting
theory, and it may well work out, but I'm going to try to develop a more
conservative approach.

The second option is to say that just uttering a conditional, *If A, B*,
adds *A* to the background information. This seems like a bad option.
For one thing, there is no independent reason to believe that this is
true. For another, it can't explain what is wrong with the following
kind of argument.

1.  Burns knows that if *p*, then if *q*, *p* and *q*

2.  Burns knows that it is not the case that if *q*, *p* and *q*

3.  Burns is logically perfect, and knows the logical consequences of
    everything he knows

4.  So, Burns knows not *p*

In a case where Burns doesn't know whether *p* is true, and Burns is
indeed logically perfect, then intuitively (1), (2) and (3) are true,
but (4) are false. And since no conditionals were asserted, it is hard
to see how the context was shifted.

The third, and best, option is to say that the variable in the semantics
of an embedded conditional is partially bound to the antecedent.
Normally when we say *If q*, *p and q*, the content of that is C(*q*,
*p* and *q*, X), and normally X is *R(*PRO~J~). The view under
consideration says that when that conditional is itself the consequent
of a conditional, the variable X is partially bound to the antecedent of
the conditional. So the value of X is *p* plus whatever is supplied by
context.

The contextualist says that that value is *R(i*), where *i* is usually
the speaker. So the semantic content of (7.1) is C(*p*, C(*q*, *p* and
*q*, *p* + *R(i*)), *R(i*)). And that will be trivial since the middle
term is trivial. The relativist says that the contribution of context to
X is *R(*PRO~J~). So the semantic content of (7.1) is C(*p*, C(*q*, *p*
and *q*, *p* + *R(*PRO~J~)), *R(*PRO~J~)). And again, that is trivial.

This gives us a natural explanation of what is going on in the McGee
cases. There is simply an equivocation between premise and conclusion in
all of the cases. What follows from C(*p*, C(*q*, *p* and *q*, *p* +
*R(x*)), *R(x*)) and *p* is C(*q*, *p* and *q*, *p* + *R(x*)). But
that's not what we normally express by *If q*, *p and q*. At least, it
isn't what we express once we've made it clear that *p* is not part of
the background information. (Here is where Gillies' observation that the
McGee cases seem to require a context shift between stating the premises
and stating the conclusion becomes relevant.) So although modus ponens
is valid, the McGee cases are simply not instances of modus ponens,
since there is an equivocation in the value of a tacit variable.

It might be argued that this is too much of a concession to McGee. Some
people have the judgment that (7.1) is not always trivial, in particular
that conditionals *If A*, *then if B*, *A* are not always trivially
true. Personally I don't get these readings, but I note that the theory
allows for their possibility. After all, binding need not be compulsory.
We can interpret the 'she' in *If Suzy enters the race*, *she will win*
deictically, if that's what makes the best sense in the context. Perhaps
in cases where people are hearing the false readings of *If A*, *then if
B*, *A*, all that is going on is that the tacit indexical in the
embedded conditional is unbound. Similarly, if one's reaction to seeing
the McGee arguments is to interpret the embedded conditionals as false,
I suspect what is going on is that one is hearing the variables here as
unbound. As I said, I don't get these readings, but I can explain where
these readings come from.

The story I'm telling about the McGee cases is hardly new. Indeed, the
view that the McGee cases are not strictly speaking instances of Modus
Ponens is old enough to have been disparaged by William Lycan in his
attacks on Modus Ponens.

But why should we give any privilege to *overt* indexicals? Tacit
variables can be just as important in determining which form an argument
takes. For example, the following argument is, on the most natural
interpretation of each sentence, invalid.

1.  No foreigner speaks a foreign language.

2.  Ségolinè is a foreigner.

3.  French is a foreign language.

4.  Ségolinè does not speak French.

That is invalid on its most natural reading because the tacit variable
attached to 'foreign' in premises 1 and 3 takes a different value. No
one would reasonably say that we should rewrite the logic books so the
argument form *No F Rs a G*; *Fa*; *Gb*; so $\neg$*Rab* is not valid on
this account. Lycan is right about the downside of this point. There is
no way to tell easily and uncontroversially what the form of an argument
in natural language is. But we should never have believed such careful
matters of interpretation would be easy. (They say life wasn't meant to
be.)

Having said that, on the indexical relativist proposal offered here, it
isn't *that* hard to tell what the value of X in a typical indicative
is. It is usually *R(*PRO~J~), and there might be a very short list of
circumstances where it takes any other value. Any indexical account
faces a potential cost that it makes interpretation more difficult than
it might otherwise be, since the hearer has to determine the value for
the indexical. The fact that X is usually *R(*PRO~J~) minimises that
cost. What is new to my proposal is that X might be partially bound in
the McGee cases. But that only helps the interpretative task, since it
reduces the task to a familiar problem interpreters face when the
speaker uses a partially bound plural pronoun.

But the primary point of this proposal is not to offer a new solution to
the McGee cases. Rather it is to note one of the requirements of this
kind of (relatively familiar) solution. An equivocation solution
requires that there be something in the semantic content of the
conditional that takes different values in the consequent of premise 1
and in the conclusion. And non-indexical theories, by definition, can't
say that there is any such thing. For the whole point of such theories
is to deny that the content of a conditional is always different in
contexts with different information sets. So they cannot say the McGee
arguments (or the other arguments I surveyed above that use Modus Ponens
in embedded contexts) involve equivocation. But then it is hard to say
what is wrong with those arguments. So these theories seem, implausibly,
to be committed to denials of Modus Ponens. That's a sufficient reason,
I think, to be an indexicalist.

Let's take stock. In section 6 I argued that the indexical contextualist
has no explanation of why it is so easy to *agree* with another's
utterance of a conditional. In this section I argued that only the
indexicalist can offer a satisfactory explanation of what is going on in
the McGee argument. The upshot of these two arguments is that we should
be indexical relativists. For only the indexical relativist can (a)
explain the agreement data and (b) explain what goes wrong in the McGee
arguments.

As a small coda, let me mention one other benefit of the partial binding
account. When I presented an earlier version of this paper at the LOGOS
workshop on Relativising Utterance Truth, the following objection was
pressed to the argument in section 1 for an epistemic treatment of
indicatives. It is true that when we know that *f*(*a*) = *f*(*b*), then
we are prepared to assert *If f*(*a*) = *x*, *then f*(*b*) = *x*. But it
is also true that when we merely suppose that *f*(*a*) = *f*(*b*), then
we are prepared to infer inside the scope of the supposition that *If
f*(*a*) = *x*, *then f*(*b*) = *x*. The epistemic account cannot
satisfactorily explain this. At the time I didn't know how to adequately
explain these intuitions, but now it seems the partial binding story can
do the work. It seems that inside the scope of a supposition that *p*,
the value of X is *p* + Y, where Y is the value X would otherwise have
had. That is, the variable in the conditional is partially bound to the
supposition that governs the discourse. That explains why all the
inferences mentioned in section one are acceptable, even when the
premise is merely a supposition.

### Coda: Methodological Ruminations {#coda-methodological-ruminations .unnumbered}

The version of relativism defended here is conservative in a number of
respects. Three stand out.

First, it is conservative about what propositions are. The propositions
that are the content of open indicatives (relative to contexts of
assessment) are true or false relative to worlds, not to judges, or
epistemic states, or anything of the sort.

Second, it is (somewhat) conservative about how the sentences get to
have those propositions as content. The standing meaning of the sentence
contains a variable place that gets filled by context. To be sure, it is
a plural variable that can be partially bound, but there is independent
evidence that plural variables can be partially bound. And of course,
and this is a radical step, its value can be different for different
assessors of the one utterance. But from the indexical relativist
perspective, the contextualist theory that values for variables are set
by contexts of utterance is an overly hasty generalisation from the
behaviour of a few simple indexicals. (It isn't clear even clear that
the contextualist theory can account for simple pronouns, like 'you' or
'now' as they appear in sentences like the one you are now reading, so
this generalisation might have been very poorly motivated in the first
place.)

Third, it is conservative about the motivation for relativism. I haven't
relied on intuitions about faultless disagreement, which is an
inherently controversial topic. Rather, I've argued that we can motivate
relativism well enough by just looking at the grounds on which people
*agree* with earlier utterances. I think there is a general
methodological point here; most of the time when theorists try to
motivate relativism using cases of disagreement, they could derive most
of their conclusions from careful studies of cases of agreement. This
method won't *always* work; I don't think you can replicate the
disagreement-based arguments for moral relativism with arguments from
agreement for example. But I think that is a weakness with moral
relativism, rather than a weakness with the methodology of focussing on
agreement rather than disagreement with arguing for relativism.

Now one shouldn't fetishise epistemic conservativeness. But a relativism
that requires less of a revision of our worldview should be more
plausible to a wider range of people than a more radical relativist
view. And that's what I've provided with the indexical relativist theory
defended here.

[^1]: It is actually a little tricky to say just what the relevant types
    are. I mean to use the term so that two people make an utterance of
    the same type if their utterances use the same words, with the same
    syntax, and the same elided material, and the same meaning. So two
    utterances of "I am Australian" could be of the same type, even if
    offered by different people. In some cases, e.g. "Steel is strong
    enough", it might be controversial whether two utterances that
    intuitively have different contents are either (a) of the same type,
    or (b) use terms with different meanings, or (c) have different
    elided material. I'll try to stay neutral on this point.

[^2]: I don't mean to suggest that these are the *only* options. I'm
    leaving off options on which there are contextual effects on
    semantic content that are not syntactically triggered, for example.
    My reason for doing that is that there are, I think, good reasons
    for thinking that the context-sensitivity of indicative conditionals
    *is* syntactically triggered, so I don't need to investigate
    non-syntactic triggers here.

[^3]: I'm assuming throughout that it is sufficient for the truth of
    C(*p*, *q*, X) that it is a priori that *p* plus X entail *q*. I
    also think that's necessary, but I won't lean on this assumption.

[^4]: The move I'm about to make bears at least a family resemblance to
    some moves @LopezDeSa2008b makes in defending what he calls
    'indexical relativism', though he means something different by that
    phrase.

[^5]: I thought this was a way in which plural pronouns were unlike
    singular pronouns, but Zoltán Szabó suggested persuasively that
    singular pronouns could also be partially bound in the sense
    described below. The interesting cases concern pronouns that seem to
    refer to objects made from multiple parts, with circumstances of
    utterance determining some parts of the referent, and the other
    parts being the denotata of the terms to which the pronoun is
    partially bound. I'm not going to take a stand on whether such
    pronouns exist, but if Szabó's suggestion is correct, then the need
    to take X to be a plural variable is lessened.

[^6]: This response is similar to some of the arguments for speech act
    pluralism in @Cappelen2005.
