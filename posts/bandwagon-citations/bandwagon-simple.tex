\title{Bandwagon Effects in Citation Data}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Articles that reference highly cited articles tend to get more
citations. This effect is dramatic if by highly cited articles we mean
articles that are now highly cited. It's less dramatic, but still
notable, if we mean articles that were highly cited at the time the
original article was published. This should give us some pause if we use
citation data for making professional decisions, such as decisions about
who to hire or to fund. Comparisons of citations between authors who
work in fields of differing popularity can easily be misleading.
\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}\label{overview}

This paper concerns a striking fact about the way philosophy journal
articles are cited in philosophy journals. Articles that reference
highly cited articles get many more citations. As
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-comparison-all-time} shows, this effect can be
rather large.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-cohort-comparison-all-time-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cohort-comparison-all-time}}

\end{figure}%

The early years and the late years in that data are rather noisy. In the
early years, because few of the articles we'll call `highly cited' have
even been published, one of the lines is an average of very few
articles. In the late years, there hasn't been enough time to see stable
citation patterns. So for this paper I'll largely focus on the years
2000 to 2015; those are papers that were published late enough to cite
the articles now highly cited in philosophy, and also early enough to be
frequently cited themselves.
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-comparison-peak-years} is a restriction of
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-comparison-all-time} to the period I'll focus on,
i.e., 2000-2015.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-cohort-comparison-peak-years-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cohort-comparison-peak-years}}

\end{figure}%

Across those years, articles that cite highly cited articles are
themselves cited an average of 11.5 times, while those that do not are
cited an average of 3.5 times. To be clear, this is how often they are
cited in philosophy journals; we're not counting citations in journals
in other disciplines, or in books, book chapters, edited volumes,
theses, draft papers, handouts, or all the other things that one sees
in, e.g., Google Scholar. If you've only ever looked at citations on
Google Scholar, the absolute citation numbers here might look a little
small. But what's striking is the ratio. It's not obvious that one of
these numbers should be more than three times larger than the other.

The point of this paper is to explore why this ratio is so large, and
what it tells us about the nature of citation data. Given the uses to
which citation data is put in professional settings, where they are
often used as an important consideration in hiring, promotion, and
funding decisions, this discrepancy might be worrying. One might think
that it's only reasonable to use citations in these decisions if
citations are a guide to quality. But it's implausible that simply
citing something that a lot of other people cite makes the paper three
times better. The easiest first interpretation of the data is that
citation metrics are little more than a popularity contest, and like all
popularity contests they are subject to bandwagon effects. If so, they
shouldn't have any serious role to play in professional decisions.

I'm going to argue for a moderate position between these extremes.
Citation data are still useful, when used cautiously, but they are not a
great measure of the quality of papers being cited. They are a much
better measure of the \emph{influence} of those papers. Since it's
plausible to give some weight to how influential an academic's work is
in decisions about promotion and funding, it is reasonable to give some
weight to citations in making those decisions.

The primary argument for this will be empirical. Once we look more
closely at the citation data, we'll see a few things that aren't
consistent with the popularity contest story, and are better explained
by the idea that citations measure influence.

\section{The Optimist and the
Pessimist}\label{the-optimist-and-the-pessimist}

In this section I'll set out three views about what citations measure,
and present some initial evidence that citations track influence rather
than quality. I'll start with two views that are opposed to mine in
opposite directions, then end with the position I want to defend.

The figure I'll call the \emph{optimist} says that citations are a
measure of the quality of the cited work. The optimist doesn't think
this is a perfect measure, but they think they are a pretty good first
guide. Hence, they say, it's reasonable to give citation data a strong
weight in professional decisions. They are, says the optimist, the best
guide we have to the collective judgment about the quality of
philosophical work, and it's always good to listen to as many voices as
possible when trying to come to a decision about how good some work is.

The pessimist, on the other hand, says that citations measure little
more than popularity. They are no more suitable an input into
professional decisions than judgments about how well-liked, or
good-looking, the authors of papers are. In fact, they think, sometimes
they are in fact reflective of who the citing author likes, or perhaps
thinks is good-looking. So we should do away with them, and make
professional decisions solely by careful study of published works.

I plan to defend a glass half-full approach. Citations do measure
something of professional importance, but it isn't \emph{quality}, at
least in the first instance. Rather, it is \emph{influence}. Highly
cited papers are more influential.

The main evidence for this comes from a surprising pattern in the data.
If citations measure influence rather than quality or mere popularity,
we should expect that papers which cite \emph{currently} highly-cited
work benefit more than papers which cited work that was \emph{already}
highly-cited at the time. This is because influence is built through
networks of mutually-reinforcing work, while quality is intrinsic and
popularity should peak when work is most visible. And, as we'll see,
that's exactly what we do find.

If citations measure influence, they can still be professionally
important. Other things equal, it is better to assign resources to
people who will make a difference rather than those who will not. (At
least if we think the work has at least some merit.) So knowing that an
academic's work is influential is important in making professional
decisions.

But data about influence needs to be treated with caution. Whether a
work is influential turns on a host of contingent factors outside
anyone's control. Most notably, most influential works become
influential by being embedded in a larger literature, and the author who
is so embedded rarely deserves credit for the existence of that larger
literature. Nor does someone who works on topics on which no one else
has anything interesting to say deserve to be receive less credit merely
on that ground. Further, whether later academics are influenced by an
academic's work can be affected by all sorts of biases and prejudices.
So I wouldn't defend all the uses of citation data in professional
settings that the optimist would defend. But nor would I dismiss them as
mere popularity measures, like the pessimist would.

There is one very striking data point in favour of the optimist's view.
Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited} shows the articles that are most cited in the
database I'm using for this paper. I'll describe what that database is
in more details in Section~\ref{sec-methodology}, but the short version
is that I looked at one hundred prominent, English-language, analytic
philosophy journals. In those journals, I found every refernce to an
article in one of those journals from the time to journal started being
indexed by Web of Science through 2024. That produced 547290 citations
in 126136 articles. The twenty most cited articles are displayed in
Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited}.

\end{longtable}

Claims about philosophical quality are notoriously contentious, but
hopefully most readers will agree that those papers are, collectively,
pretty good. It would be very hard to find a set of twenty papers with
no citations at all which are just as good.

Still, there are reasons to push back against the optimist even here. If
the question is whether citations measure quality or influence, this
table is far from decisive. After all, these are also quite clearly very
influential paper.

And even the pessimist might raise some worries. The authors are all
white and almost all male, and the papers are all from a quarter century
ago. Is it really plausible that all the best work is so clustered?

The optimist might make two points in reply. On the age of the papers,
they might insist that citations need to be adjusted for the age of the
paper before being used as a quality measure. After all, a paper from
1975 being cited fifty times in fifty years seems less striking than a
paper from two years ago being cited fifty times in two years. On the
demographics, they might concede that this was a problem, but that the
discipline is getting somewhat better in appreciating work that isn't by
white men. The data \emph{somewhat} bears out this claim. In
Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited-2020s}, I've listed the papers that are most
cited in the database in articles published in the 2020s.

I'll leave it to the reader to judge whether this is a sufficiently
diverse group of authors to adequately respond to the pessimist's
charge. For present purposes, I want to look at a different point, one
that I think supports the story that citations measure influence rather
than quality.

Some papers appear on just one of Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited} and
Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited-2020s}. I'll focus on two prominent such
papers, Sally Haslanger's ``Gender and Race'', and Frank Jackson's
``Epiphenomenal Qualia''. Figure~\ref{fig-haslanger} and
Figure~\ref{fig-jackson} show how often those papers are cited each year
since their publication, as a proportion of all citations that
year.\footnote{The normalisation is crucial because the number of
  citations per year has exploded in the 2020s.}

It's hard to make sense of changes in citation patterns like this on the
strongest version of the optimist story. If citations measure quality,
do we have to say that ``Gender and Race'' is three or four times better
now than it was a few years ago, while ``Epiphenomenal Qualia'' is three
or four times worse? That's barely a coherent claim. Even if we admit
that the optimist just claims citations are a noisy measure, the ranges
here indicate that there is quite a lot of noise indeed.

A more plausible thing to say is that ``Gender and Race'' is much more
influential than it used to be, while ``Epiphenomenal Qualia'' is
considerably less influential than it used to be. On the `influence'
model of citations, one implication of Figure~\ref{fig-haslanger} and
Figure~\ref{fig-jackson} is that no one paper is now as influential as
``Epiphenonemal Qualia'' was for two decades. That actually sounds
plausible to me; it's a sign of how much more specialised philosophy has
become.

The pessimist can also use a feature of Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited} and
Table~\ref{tbl-most-cited-2020s} to argue for their view. The range of
subjects of those papers does not reflect the range of things
philosophers write about. There is no history of philosophy, no
aesthetics, and no philosophy of religion. There is very little
philosophy of science, or political philosophy, and not much
ethics.\footnote{Precisely how much there is in each of these categories
  depends on just how one draws the subdiscipliniary boundaries. But
  however one draws them, these topics are under-represented in the
  tables relative to their contribution to philosophy.}

There are two straightforward reasons for these facts. One is that
journals play a different role in different subdisciplines, so a measure
looking primarily at journals will not be as useful a measure across all
of philosophy. But the bigger measure is that the norms on citations
differ dramatically between different fields. Most notably, historians
of philosophy cite other historians much less than, say, metaphysicians
cite other metaphysicians. That's in part because so many citations in
history papers are to primary sources, and in part because citation
norms have changed dramatically in fields like metaphysics in recent
years in the direction of much more expansive citations. The result is
that comparing citations between individual philosophers across
different fields will rarely be a useful measure of quality, or
influence, or anything that might be professionally relevant. It just
won't be a like for like comparison.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec-methodology}

The data I'm using comes from Web of Science (WoS), combining XML files
(through 2021) and website downloads (2022-2024). I filtered the XML
data to articles in journals categorized as Philosophy or History \&
Philosophy of Science, then hand-selected one hundred journals with the
most inbound citations that were mostly English-language, broadly
analytic (rather than continental), and not just history of science. The
complete journal list appears in Table~\ref{tbl-list-of-journals} in
Section~\ref{sec-appendix}.

For these journals, I included all articles plus notes and reviews over
15 pages, regardless of WoS subject classification. This ensures
complete coverage for interdisciplinary journals where WoS labels are
unreliable.

Two supplemental steps were needed. First, WoS doesn't index \emph{The
Journal of Philosophy} from 1971-1974, so it leaves out many influential
articles. I compiled a complete article list from JSTOR and manually
searched for citations to these articles. Some data discontinuities
around this period may stem from this dual methodology.

Second, my XML data extends only through 2021. I downloaded 2022-2024
data from the WoS website, processing it with the bibliometrix package
(\citeproc{ref-bibliometrix}{Aria and Cuccurullo 2017}). Cross-checking
2021 data showed differences under 1\% for article counts and slightly
over 1\% for citations---close enough to combine the datasets reliably.

In this data set, 318 articles have at least 100 citations. I'm calling
these the `highly cited' articles. Their temporal distribution is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-when-highly-cited}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-when-highly-cited-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-when-highly-cited}How many articles published each
year have at least 100 citations.}

\end{figure}%

I decided to focus on articles published between 2000 and 2015 because
before 2000, there are too many highly cited articles that could not
possibly be cited, and after 2015 the citation numbers are so low that
the data is too noisy. The WoS data quality is much higher for journals
that use bibliographies rather than those that use citations in
footnotes. By 2000 most journals had switched over to using
bibliographies, so we don't have quite as many worries about data
quality as we do before then.

In later sections I'm going to consider articles that were highly cited
at various times. The articles with at least 100 citations make up about
0.32\% of the published articles. When considering which articles were
highly cited at various times, I'm going to look at the articles that
are in the top 0.3\% of articles then published by number of citations,
including ties. (I'm using 0.3\% rather than 0.32\% because sometimes
there are a lot of ties, so it often ends up around 0.32\% anyway.)
Citations have been expanding so quickly that getting into this category
used to require many fewer citations than it does now. For example, as
of 2000, an article with 29 citations was in the top 0.3\% of articles
by citations.

\section{Citing the Highly Cited}\label{sec-cite-highly-cited}

As noted earlier, from 2000-2015, it seemed to help one's citations a
lot to cite an article that would eventually get 100 or more citations.
In the next section, I'll come back to how much it helped to cite an
article that was already highly cited. In this section I'll look at
whether there are simple explanations for the difference noted earlier:
articles which cite one of the highly cited get an average of 11.5
citations, while those that do not get an average of 3.5 citations.

The first thing to check is whether this is just an effect of timing.
Perhaps the articles that cite highly cited articles are from times that
tend to have higher citations. Figure~\ref{fig-pct-articles-citinghc}
suggests this is at least possible, since the percentage of articles
that do cite highly cited articles changes considerably over the period
we're looking at.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-pct-articles-citinghc-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-pct-articles-citinghc}The proportion of articles
each year citing highly cited articles}

\end{figure}%

But if we were just looking at an artifact of publication time, we'd
expect the articles that cite highly cited articles to be cited
\emph{less} often, since the times when highly cited articles are more
common cited tend to have fewer citations. We see this in
Figure~\ref{fig-citations-by-year}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-citations-by-year-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-citations-by-year}Average number of citations each
year.}

\end{figure}%

I'll still check for temporal effects in what follows, but the initial
evidence is that this doesn't explain the difference.

A more plausible explanation is that articles which have more references
to other articles tend to get cited more. This is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-avg-cites-by-refs-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-avg-cites-by-refs}Average number of citations for
articles with different number of references.}

\end{figure}%

This could explain the difference quite simple. Obviously articles that
have more outgoing references are more likely to cite a highly cited
article. They are more likely to cite any random collection of articles.
And as Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs} shows, that means they will in
general have more citations.

There are two reasons for the pattern we see in
Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs}. One is that you'd expect longer
papers to have more citations. If we model editors as trying to maximise
citations and constrained by a page budget, then the quantity they'll
try to maximise is not the number of citations per article, but the
number of citations per page. On this model, the effect seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs} arises because number of citations is
a reasonable proxy for length.

But I doubt that explains everything going on here. Remember that both
axes in Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs} measure citations in
philosophy journals. Some of the papers represented in those large dots
in the bottom left might be widely discussed, but not in philosophy
journals. That could be because they are papers at the intersection of
philosophy and some other field, and are primarily discussed in that
other field. Or it could be because they are papers in history of
philosophy which largely discuss primary sources or contemporary books.
So it's not surprising that there is an effect here, and we should
control for it before making any claims about the effect of citing
highly cited articles in particular.

What we see in Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs-split} is that citing
highly cited articles makes a difference even if we control for number
of references.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-avg-cites-by-refs-split-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-avg-cites-by-refs-split}Even controlling for number
of references, citing a highly cited article matters.}

\end{figure}%

Among articles with \emph{n} references, for \emph{n} from 1 to 15,
those that cite highly cited articles always have more citations. On
average, the articles that do cite highly cited articles get 84\% more
citations.\footnote{That is, the geometric mean of the ratio between the
  two lines in Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs-split} is 1.8398964.} I
did a much longer analysis that controlled both for when articles was
published and how many references they had, using somewhat arbitrary
buckets to ensure I was always comparing sufficiently large numbers of
articles, and the result turned out almost exactly the same. That is,
citing a highly cited article was associated with an 84\% increase in
citations. Given the results were so similar, I won't go over all the
details here, and instead just look at the graphs that don't control for
publication date.

This increase of 84\% is not small. Further, it's incredibly unlikely
that by pure chance the `Cites highly cited' line in
Figure~\ref{fig-avg-cites-by-refs-split} would be higher than the
`Doesn't cite highly cited' line at all 15 data points. But this is
still a considerably smaller effect than we saw at the start, when
looking at the raw averages of citations for papers that do and don't
cite highly cited papers. On the raw averages, citing a highly cited
paper was correlated with an increase in citations of 225\%. So
controlling for the numner of references was important.

Should we also control for where a paper is published? Perhaps it's just
the case that papers published in journals like \emph{Philosophical
Review} are both more likely to cite highly cited articles, and more
likely to be cited? I'm not going to control for that for a couple of
reasons. It's not that the presuppositions are wrong. In fact,
\emph{Philosophical Review} articles are much more likely than the
average article to cite highly cited articles, and are more likely to be
cited. But there are two reasons to not control for publication venue.

One reason is that controlling for the number of references to
philosophy journals in a paper already does much of the work you might
want when controlling for publication venue. In
Figure~\ref{fig-where-published}, I've graphed two things. The smaller
blue dots show, for each of the journals, the average number of
references in each paper to other journals, and the percentage of papers
that cite highly cited articles. The larger coral dots (with lines
connecting them) show what percentage of articles with that many
references cite highly cited articles.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-where-published-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-where-published}References and citations for
different journals.}

\end{figure}%

As you can see, the journals mostly cluster around the average. The one
notable exception is \emph{Philosophy Compass}, for reasons I don't
quite understand. But in general, any connection between publication
venue and percentage of papers that cite highly cited articles is
already accounted for by controlling for the number of references.

The other reason I don't want to control for venue is that when we use
citation data in practice, we typically do not in fact control for
venue. Nobody would give the following speech. ``Yes, Professor X's
publications are widely cited. But that's just because she only
published in \emph{Philosophical Review} and \emph{Mind}. Relative to
the average papers in those journals, her papers do not stand out.''
It's clear what's wrong with this speech. The people who are impressed
by Professor X's papers, and are using citation data to support their
view, will say that it's because the papers are so good that they ended
up in \emph{Philosophical Review} and \emph{Mind}, and that's also why
they were widely cited. It's not that they were widely cited merely
because they were in those venues. If we controlled for publication
venue, we'd be resembling a bit too closely the person who makes this
speech, rather than the person impressed by Professor X.

\section{Three Theoretical Accounts}\label{sec-three-accounts}

So after taking account of possible alternative explanations, it seems
plausible that citing a highly cited article leads to an increase in
citations of around 84\%. What could explain this?

The strongest form of the optimist story is that citing one of these
papers is a sign of quality. It's hard to find this story plausible.
Just citing ``New Work for a Theory of Universals'' or other papers like
that is not in itself a sign that the paper is nearly twice as good as
it would be otherwise. I certainly don't think my citation of ``New
Work'' in this paper makes the paper twice as good. This doesn't show
that citations are wholly independent of paper quality, just that there
are patterns in the citation data that aren't explained by the quality
of the paper being cited.

The strongest form of the pessimist story is that citations are just a
measure of something like popularity, and associating with the popular
papers is a way of acquiring popularity. This isn't a priori
implausible, and it would explain the data I've presented so far. But
we'll see in Section~\ref{sec-then-now} that there are other data points
that it doesn't explain as well.

The theory that citations track influence does just as good a job as the
theory that citations track popularity at explaining the data in
Section~\ref{sec-cite-highly-cited}. This might not be immediately
obvious, so let's work through an example. I'll focus on John
MacFarlane's 2003 paper ``Future Contingents and Relative Truth''. This
has 120 citations in the journals we're looking at, so it's one of the
highly cited papers. But, like with most highly cited papers in
philosophy, it took a few years for the citations to appear in large
numbers. Figure~\ref{fig-macfarlane} shows its citation frequency since
publication.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-macfarlane-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-macfarlane}Citation frequency for MacFarlane
(\citeproc{ref-WOS000183846000001}{2003})}

\end{figure}%

Through 2008, that's five years after publication, it had only ten
citations. That's more than most papers, but not a sign that it would be
as cited as it turned out to be over the five years after
that.\footnote{The drop after 2015 isn't because the subject matter of
  the paper was less discussed; it's rather that people started citing
  MacFarlane's 2014 book \emph{Assessment Sensitivity}. At one time I
  thought looking at which papers had dramatic falls in citations would
  be an interesting guide to changing fashions in the field. But it
  turned out that most dramatic drops were because papers had been
  superseded by books, and that's what happened here. Why that reverses
  in the 2020s, and people more frequently cite papers that have been
  superseded by books, is itself interesting, but for another day.}
What's relevant to our purposes is revealed in
Table~\ref{tbl-macfarlane}, which lists those ten papers, and shows how
often they were cited in the hundred journals.

It shouldn't be controversial that ``Future Contingents'' was an
influential paper. It was the first presentation in print of
MacFarlane's distinctive version of relativism, which became one of the
most discussed theories in philosophy. What is less clear is which claim
we should believe about the relationship between ``Future Contingents''
and the papers in Table~\ref{tbl-macfarlane}. Here are two prima facie
plausible claims.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One manifestation of the influence of ``Future Contingents'' is that
  it led to later discussions, by MacFarlane himself as well as by
  Lasersohn, Glanzberg, Brogaard and others, which in turn were
  extremely influential.
\item
  One reason that ``Future Contingents'' was so influential is that a
  network of fascinating papers built up around it, with these early
  works by Lasersohn, Glanzberg and Brogaard near its center, and it was
  that network more than any one paper which was influential in the
  field.
\end{enumerate}

The explanation I like of the result in
Section~\ref{sec-cite-highly-cited} is that both these claims are true.
We want to explain why papers which cite highly cited papers, like
``Future Contingents'', are cited more often than average. The influence
story is that if these later papers, the ones in
Table~\ref{tbl-macfarlane}, had no been so influential, then ``Future
Contingents'' would not have been as influential, and hence not as
highly cited.

That's a nice story; it brings out how philosophy is a collective
enterprise and the big developments in the field come not from lone
geniuses but from fruitful interactions. But how could we tell if is it
true? What predictions does it make that differ from the raw popularity
story? That's what we'll turn to in Section~\ref{sec-then-now}.

\section{Testing the Stories}\label{sec-then-now}

So far I've discussed the citation records of papers that cite papers
which are, as of 2024, highly cited. We could also look at the citation
records of papers which cite papers that were, at the time those papers
were published, highly cited. If citations are just tracking popularity,
then we might expect these papers would also get a boost to their
citation numbers. On the influence story, we'd expect that the effect
would disappear, since these papers can't possibly influence how many
citations the papers they cited already had.

As noted earlier, I'll say that a paper is highly cited at a time if
it's in the top 0.3\% of papers published up to that time by citation
count. (In case of ties, I'll include anything with as many cites as a
paper in the top 0.3\%.) The big test will be to look at papers that do
and don't cite such a paper, as of their own publication time, and ask
how often they are cited.

The raw data, not controlled for any possible confounds, suggests that
things are like the popularity story predicts. (Again, the data here is
all about papers from 2000-2015.) Papers which cite papers that were at
the time highly cited get an average of 10.85 citations, while those
that do not get an average of 5.68. The former number is 91\% larger.

But as before, the raw data is misleading. This could just be an
artifact of the facts that articles that include more references are
more widely cited, and that articles that include more references are
more likely to cite articles from any arbitrary set. We should control
for the number of references in the cited article. When we do that, we
get Figure~\ref{fig-then-high-cited}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{bandwagon-simple_files/figure-pdf/fig-then-high-cited-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-then-high-cited}The relationship between references
and citations for articles that do and do not cite then highly cited
articles.}

\end{figure}%

The result is that there is still a clear benefit to citing articles
that were, at the time, highly cited. It would be implausible to say
that it's just a coincidence that the first fourteen data points in
Figure~\ref{fig-then-high-cited} point in the same direction. But the
effect is small. The difference between the data points in
Figure~\ref{fig-then-high-cited} is, on average, just 20\%. I tried a
few other ways of controlling for both publication year and the number
of references and the result was always that the surplus was around
15-20\%. That's not nothing, and we can be very confident the true value
is greater than zero. So this set of data gives some support to the
popularity story.

But it looks like it gives more support to the influence story. When we
say that there is a citation benefit to citing highly cited articles,
that is only true if we mean citing articles that are \emph{now} highly
cited. And that means that the articles that accrue the extra citations
probably made an impact in making those articles be highly cited.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}

The results here should give some pause to those using citation data in
professional decisions, especially those to do with hiring, promoting,
or funding. Citations are far from an unbiased measure of the quality of
philosophical work. For one thing, citation numbers tend to be very
different in different fields of philosophy. For another, citations
don't seem to be distributed evenly across demographic categories.

Those facts probably aren't new to a lot of readers. What might be new
is the data shown here about how citations tend to cluster in topics.
One key way to get more citations is to write about something that will
be a central philosophical topic in a few years time.

That said, writing about something that will be a central topic might in
itself be a virtue in philosophical work. Perhaps it is just a sign of
predictive skill, of being able to skate to where the puck is going.
