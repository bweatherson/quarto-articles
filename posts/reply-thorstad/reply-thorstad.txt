It's natural to have an externalist account of ecological rationality. The usual defence of a heuristic is that it works, and what it means for something to work is that it gets decent results in the kind of environment the subject is in. That is, the usual defence is basically some kind of reliabilism, and hence externalist. Unsurprisingly, most authors who have written on ecological rationality have either implicitly assumed, or explicitly argued for, an externalist account.

In "Ecological rationality without externalism", David @ThorstadERWE raises a number of really good challenges to this natural view. The point of this note is to argue that the right response to these challenges is not, as Thorstad argues, to embrace internalism. But nor is it to dismiss the challenges. Rather, these challenges tell us some interesting things about the right form of externalism, and in particular about how externalists need to pay attention to time.

I'm going to focus on two challenges in particular that Thorstad raises. The first is that externalists don't properly account for the importance of the subject's information.^[I'm going to use 'information' and 'evidence' interchangably here; whether they need to be distinguished is left for a larger project.] The second is that externalist theories get the wrong answer about cases in which the subjects change environments. Let's take these two in order.

In §5, Thorstad argues that externalist theories don't account ...



Blah blah introduction

There is a simple way in which ecological rationality can be both information sensitive and externalist. Say that what's the proper subject of rationality is not what the agent does or believes, but the function the agent adopts from information to actions and beliefs. That could still be externalist if either the inputs to the function are individuated by externalist standards (e.g., following @Williamson2000), or if the evaluation of the function itself is externalist. If what makes a function good or bad is not that it conforms to a priori standards of success, but simply that it works (on average, in similar enough environments), we'll still have an externalist theory. Thorstad notes the first option, largely to set it aside. I'll concentrate here on the second option.

This simple theory, as described, is much too simple. If the 

One, which Thorstad carefully notes though mostly to set aside, is that one might take information itself to be externalist. The natural view here is the one defended by Timothy @Williamson2000. If being information requires being known, and what one knows depends on things external to the agent, then information that subjects get different information when they see something than when they merely hallucinate it, 


-------

Setting this aside for now. One question and a thought.

Question: The paper is framed as a dispute between externalist views and information-sensitive views. But why not both? If information is externalist (a la Williamson), or if the information/support relation is externalist (e.g., depends on contingent correlations) you'll have both.

Thought: The most interesting cases in the paper, in §5.2 and §9, turn on environments changing. There might be a connection to old Dretske stuff here about the learning environment and the application environment. But more importantly, this shows that rationality is sensitive to the information *stream* not the information *set*. In multi-arm bandit problems, the practically optimal strategies are sensitive to which order you get information in. (See also Holton on how intentions should be resilient even in the face of some evidence that would have led to them not being formed.) This would be enough to capture the relevant cases, and seems independently interesting.
