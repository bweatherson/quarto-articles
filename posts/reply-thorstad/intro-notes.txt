David Thorstad's "Ecological rationality without externalism" develops an information-sensitive account of bounded rationality as an alternative to traditional externalist approaches. Theories of ecological rationality hold that rational strategies are environment-relative: a belief-forming process or decision procedure may be rational in environments where it performs well but irrational elsewhere. Most articulations of ecological rationality have been externalist, making rationality depend on the actual structure of an agent's environment and the actual performance of strategies within it. Thorstad argues that an information-sensitive approach—on which rationality depends on evidential probabilities generated by the agent's total evidence—avoids key challenges facing externalism while retaining many of its advantages.

Thorstad raises three main challenges to externalism in Section 5. (NOTE THIS SENTENCE IS WRONG - THIS ISN'T SOMETHING HE SAYS!) First, externalist views struggle to capture the normative force of informational limitations: if excellent evidence suggests a process will perform badly but it actually performs well, externalists must say the agent should use it anyway. Second, externalist views produce counterintuitive verdicts in novel environments: when an agent is transported to a new environment without realizing it, externalists cannot simultaneously vindicate the rationality of following her evidence in both the old environment and the new one. Third, externalist views fail to fully vindicate seemingly irrational cognitions in laboratory settings where agents are misled about which environment they occupy, undercutting a key project of ecological rationality theory.

In Section 9, Thorstad applies his information-sensitive framework to poverty traps. He notes that agents exiting poverty often retain short-termist patterns of behavior—high borrowing, low saving—for some time after their circumstances improve, even when such behaviors are no longer beneficial. Thorstad argues that information-sensitive accounts can rationalize this "rational short-termist delay" in ways externalist accounts cannot: agents gradually adapt their strategies as they acquire evidence about their changed environment, rather than being required to immediately shift behavior once external circumstances change. This expanded rationalizing treatment, he suggests, helps avoid victim-blaming not only for those currently in poverty but also for those shaped by past experiences of poverty.
