title: "Doing Philosophy With Words"
description: |
  This paper discusses the coverage of ordinary language philosophy in Scott Soames' "Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century". After praising the book's virtues, I raise three points where I dissent from Soames' take on the history. First, I suggest that there is more to ordinary language philosophy than the rather implausible version of it that Soames sees to have been destroyed by Grice. Second, I argue that confusions between analyticity, necessity and priority are less important to the ordinary language period than Soames takes them to be. Finally, I claim that Soames' criticisms of Ryle turn in part on attributing reductionist positions to Ryle that Ryle did not hold.

Scott @Soames2003 has written two wonderfully useful books that will be
valuable introductions to twentieth century philosophy. The books arose
out of his well-received classes on the history of twentieth century
history at Princeton, and will be valuable to anyone teaching similar
courses. I shall be relying on them as I teach such a course at Cornell.

Published in *Philosophical Studies* 135 (2007): 429-37.

The books consist of detailed case studies of important
twentieth-century works. They are best read alongside those original
texts. Anyone who works through the canon in this way will have an
excellent introduction to what twentieth century philosophers were
trying to do. The selections are judicious, and while some are obvious
classics some are rather clever choices of papers that are
representative of the type of work being done at the time. And Soames
doesn't just point to the most important works to study, but the most
important sections of those works.

Soames's discussion of these pieces is always built around an analysis
of their strengths and weaknesses. He praises the praiseworthy, but the
focus, at least in the sections I'm discussing (ordinary language
philosophy from Wittgenstein to Grice), is on where these philosophers
go wrong. This is particularly so when the mistakes are representative
of a theme. There are three main mistakes Soames finds in philosophers
of this period. First, they rely logical positivism long after it had
been shown to be unviable. Second, they disregard the principle that
semantics should be systematic. Third, they ignore the distinction
between necessity and a priority. All three constitute major themes of
Soames's book, and indeed of twentieth century philosophy as Soames sees
it.

These books concentrate, almost to a fault, on discussion of
philosophers' published works, as opposed to the context in which they
are written. Apart from occasionally noting that some books were
released posthumously, we aren't told whether the philosophers who wrote
them are alive, and only in one case are we told when a philosopher was
born. This kind of external information does not seem important to
Soames. He is the kind of historian who would prefer a fourth reading of
Austin's published works to a first reading of his wartime diaries. And
he'd prefer to spend the evening working on refutations, or charitable
reformulations, of Austin's arguments to either. I'm mostly sympathetic
to this approach; this is history of *philosophy* after all. We can
leave discussions of the sociology of 1950s Oxford to those better
qualified. But this choice about what to write about has consequences.

Most of Soames's chapters focus almost exclusively on a particular book
or paper. The exceptions are like the chapter on *Sense and Sensibilia*,
where Soames contrasts Austin's discussion with Ayer's response. We
learn a lot about the most important works that way, but less about
their intellectual environment. So the book doesn't have much by way of
broad discussion about overall trends or movements. There's very little,
for example, about who were the influencers and who the influenced.
There's nothing about how anyone not called 'Wittgenstein' changed their
positions in response to criticism. One assumes from the chronology that
Ryle's influence on Austin was greater than Austin's influence on Ryle,
for example, but Soames is silent on whether this is true.

Soames says at one point that, "[Ryle] was, along with Wittgenstein,
J. L. Austin, and Paul Grice, one of the prime movers in postwar
philosophy in England." (68). But we aren't really told why this is so,
apart from the discussion of some prominent works of these four
philosophers. (Perhaps Soames has taken the maxim *Show it, don't say
it* rather completely to heart.) Nor are why told why the list includes
those four, and not, say, Strawson or Geach or Anscombe. Actually
Anscombe's absence reminds us that there is almost no discussion of
women in philosophy in the book. That's not Soames fault, it's a
reflection of a long-running systematic problem in philosophy that the
discipline has a hard time recruiting and retaining women. Could some of
that be traced back to what was going on in the ordinary language
period? That kind of questions *can't* be addressed by the kind of
history book that Soames has written, where the focus is on the best
philosophical writing, and not on the broader philosophical community.

One of the other consequences of the format is that, by necessity, many
important figures are left out, on pain of writing a fifteen-volume
book. In the period under discussion here there was historically
important work by (among many others) Nelson Goodman, Wilfrid Sellars
and Roderick Chisholm, some of which connects up closely to the themes
and interests of the ordinary language philosophers, but none of which
is as much as mentioned. (Goodman is mentioned in the epilogue as
someone Soames regrets not covering.)

Now this can't be a complaint about the book Soames has written, because
it would have been impossible to cover any more figures than he did in
the style and depth that he did. And it would have been impossible to
tell in detail the story of how Ryle's impact on the philosophical world
differed from Austin's, or of the painfully slow integration of women
into the top echelons of philosophy, without making the book be even
more monumental than it is. All we're left with is a half-hearted
expression of regret that he didn't write a different *kind* of book,
one that told us more about the forest, even as we value what he says
about the tallest of the trees.

### Grice and The End of Ordinary Language

There is one place where Soames stops to survey the field, namely his
discussion of the impact of Grice's work on the ordinary language
tradition. Soames argues that with Grice's William James lectures, the
idea of ordinary language philosophy had "run their course". The
position seems to be that Grice overthrew a paradigm that had been
vibrant for two decades, but was running out of steam by the time of
Grice's James lectures. How plausible is this?

The first step is to work out just what it was that @Grice1989 refuted.
When summarising the ordinary language paradigm that he takes Grice to
have overthrown, Soames is uncharacteristically harsh. In Soames's
summary one of the characteristic activities of an ordinary language
philosopher is "opportunistically assembling reminders about how
philosophically significant words are used in ordinary settings" (216).
That *may* be a fair enough description of *some* mid-century work, but
it isn't a fair summary of the best of the work that Soames has spent
the previous two hundred odd pages discussing. It all suggests that
Grice didn't so much overthrow ordinary language philosophy as much as
badly done ordinary language philosophy, and this category might not
include Strawson, Ryle, Austin and so on.

More importantly, it isn't entirely clear just what it was Grice did
that caused this paradigm shift. In Soames's telling it seems the
development of the speaker meaning/semantic meaning distinction was
crucial, but @Austin1962 at least already recognised this distinction,
indeed appealed to it twice in *Sense and Sensibilia*. Soames mentions
the discussion on pages 89 to 91 of *Sense and Sensibilia* of phrases
like "I see two pieces of paper", and there is also the intriguing
discussion on pages 128-9 of the relation between *accurate* and *true*
where Austin goes close to stating Grice's submaxim of concision.

The other suggestion is that Grice restored the legitimacy and
centrality of systematic semantic theorising. It's true Grice did that,
but this doesn't show we have to give up ordinary language philosophy
unless it was impossible to be an ordinary language philosopher and a
systematic semanticist. And it isn't clear that this really is
impossible. It hardly seems *inconsistent* with the kind of philosophy
Austin did (especially in his theory of perception) that one endorse a
systematic semantic theory. (Though Austin *himself* rarely put forward
systematic analyses.) Notably, there are plenty of very systematic
formal semanticists who take Strawson's work on descriptions seriously,
and try and integrate it into formal models. So we might wonder why
Grice's work shouldn't have led to a kind of ordinary language
philosophy where we paid more careful attention to system-building.

More broadly, we might wonder whether the ordinary language period
really did end. The analysis of knowledge industry (strangely
undiscussed in a work on *analysis* in the twentieth century) seemed to
putter along much the same before and after the official demise of
ordinary language philosophy. And there are affinities between the
ordinary language philosophers and important contemporary research
programs, e.g. the 'Canberra Plan' as described by Frank @Jackson1998.
So perhaps before we asked who killed ordinary language philosophy (It
was Professor Grice! In Emerson Hall!! With the semantics/pragmatics
distinction!!!) we should have made sure there was a corpse. More on
this point presently.

### A Whig History?

One of the major themes of Soames's discussion is that there are some
systematic problems in twentieth century philosophy that are righted by
the heroes at the end of the story. I already mentioned the heroic role
assigned to Grice. But the real star of the show is @Kripke1980, who
comes in as a deus ex machina at the end showing how different necessity
and a priority are, and thereby righting all manner of grievous wrongs.
That Kripke is an important figure in twentieth century philosophy is
hardly a matter of dispute, but Soames does stretch a little to find
errors for our hero to correct.

Some of the complaints about philosophers collapsing the necessary/a
priori distinction do hit the target, but don't leave deep wounds in
their victims. For instance, Soames quotes @Ryle1954 arguing (in
*Dilemmas*) that perception cannot be a physiological process because if
it were we couldn't *know* whether we saw a tree until we found out the
result of complicated brain scans. Soames points out, perfectly
correctly, that the seeing might be necessarily identical to the brain
process even if we don't know, and even can't know without complicated
measurements, whether they are identical. Soames is right that Ryle has
made an epistemological argument here when a metaphysical argument was
needed. But rewriting Ryle so he makes that metaphysical argument isn't
hard. If my seeing the tree is necessarily identical to the brain
process, and the brain process is (as Ryle and Soames seem to agree it
is) individuated by the brain components that implement it, then I
couldn't have seen the tree had one of the salient neurons in my brain
been silently replaced with a functionally equivalent silicon chip.
Since it *is* possible that I could have seen a tree even if a salient
neuron was replaced with a functionally equivalent silicon chip, the
seeing and the brain process are not necessarily identical. So while
Ryle might have slipped here, and Kripke's work does help us correct the
slip, the consequences of this are basically verbal.

A more important charge of ignoring the necessary/a priori distinction
comes in Soames's discussion of Wittgenstein's deflationism about
philosophy. Here is the salient passage.

> His deflationary conception of philosophy is also consistent with, and
> even derivative from, his new ideas about meaning plus a set of
> unquestioned philosophical presuppositions he brings to the
> enterprise. The philosophical presuppositions include the then current
> and widespread assumptions that (i) that philosophical theses are not
> empirical, and hence must be necessary and a priori, and (ii) that the
> necessary, the a priori and the analytic are one and the same. Because
> he takes these assumptions for granted, he takes it for granted that
> if there are any philosophical truths, they must be analytic (29).

This seems to me to be mistaken twice over.

First, it isn't clear to me that there is *any* appeal to concepts of
necessity in the passages in Wittgenstein Soames is summarising here,
and metaphysical necessity simply doesn't seem to have been a major
interest of Wittgenstein's. Wittgenstein does appear to reason that if a
proposition is not empirical it is a priori, but that inference doesn't
go via claims about necessity, and isn't shown to be fallacious by any
of Kripke's examples.

Second, it simply isn't true that philosophers in Wittgenstein's time
took for granted that the analytic and the a priori were one and the
same. To be sure, many philosophers in the early twentieth century
(including many argue the younger Wittgenstein) argued against Kant's
claim that they are distinct, but this isn't quite the same as taking
for granted they are identical. And there are a few places where
Wittgenstein appears to accept that some propositions are synthetic a
priori. For example in *Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics* he
says it is synthetic a priori that there is no reddish green, (Part III,
para 39) and goes on to say this about primes.

> The distribution of primes would be an ideal example of what could be
> called synthetic a priori, for one can say that it is at any rate not
> discoverable by an analysis of the concept of a prime number.
> [@Wittgenstein1956 Part III, para 42]

Now it is far from obvious what the connection is between remarks such
as these and the remarks about the impossibility of philosophical theses
in the *Investigations*. Indeed it is not obvious whether Wittgenstein
really believed in the synthetic a priori at any stage of his career.
But given his lack of interest in metaphysical necessity, and openness
to the possibility of synthetic a priori claims, it seems unlikely that
he was, tacitly or otherwise, using the argument Soames gives him to get
the deflationary conclusions.[^2]

### Getting the Question Right

As I mentioned above, Soames's is the kind of history that focuses on
the works of prominent philosophers, rather than their historical
context. There's much to be gained from this approach, in particular
about what the greats can tell us about pressing philosophical
questions. But one of the costs is that in focussing on what they say
about *our* questions, we might overlook *their* questions. In most
cases this is a trap Soames avoids, but in the cases of Austin and Ryle
the trap may have been sprung.

Soames sees Austin in *Sense and Sensibilia* as trying to offer us a new
argument against radical scepticism.

> Austin's ultimate goal is to undermine the coherence of skepticism.
> His aim is not just to show that skepticism is unjustified, or
> implausible, or that it is a position no one has reason to accept.
> Rather, his goal is to prevent skepticism from getting off the ground
> by denying skeptics their starting point. (173-4)

But we don't get much of an interpretative argument that this is really
Austin's goal. Indeed, Soames concedes that Austin "doesn't always
approach these questions directly" (172). I'd say he does very little to
approach them at all. To be sure, many contemporary defenders of direct
realism are interested in its anti-sceptical powers, but there's little
to show *Austin* was so moved. Scepticism is not a topic that even
arises in *Sense and Sensibilia* until the chapter on Warnock, after
Austin has finished with the criticism of Ayer that takes up a large
part of the book. And Soames doesn't address the question of how to
square the somewhat dismissive tone Austin takes towards scepticism in
"Other Minds" with the view here propounded that Austin put forward a
fairly radical theory of perception as a way of providing a new answer
to the sceptic.

If Austin wasn't trying to refute the sceptic, what was he trying to do?
The simplest explanation is that he thought direct realism was true,
sense-data theories were false, and that "there is noting so plain
boring a the constant repetition of assertions that are not true, and
sometimes no even faintly sensible; if we can reduce this a bit, it will
all be to the good." [@Austin1962 5] I'm inclined to think that in this
case the simplest explanation is the best, that Austin wrote a series of
lectures on perception because he was interested in the philosophy of
perception. Warnock says that "Austin was genuinely shocked by what
appeared to his eye to be recklessness, hurry, unrealism, and inadequate
attention to truth" [@Warnock1989 154] and suggests this explained not
only why Austin wrote the lectures but their harsh edge.

There is one larger point one might have wanted to make out of a
discussion of direct realism, or that one might have learned from a
discussion of direct realism, that seems relevant to what comes later in
Soames's book. If we really see objects, not sense-data, then objects
are constituents of intentional states. That suggests that public
objects might be constituents of other states, such as beliefs, and
hence constituents of assertions. Soames doesn't give us a discussion of
these possible historical links between direct realism and direct
reference, and that's too bad because there could be some fertile ground
to work over here. (I'm no expert on the history of the 1960s, so I'm
simply guessing as to whether there is a historical link between direct
realism and direct reference to go along with the strong philosophical
link between the two. But it would be nice if Soames has provided an
indication as to whether those guesses were likely to be productive or
futile.)

Soames gives us no inkling of where theories of direct reference came
from, save from the brilliant mind of Kripke. Apart from the absence of
discussion of any connection between direct realism and direct
reference, there's no discussion of the possible connections between
Wittgenstein's later theories and direct reference, as Howard
@Wettstein2004 has claimed exist. And there's no discussion of the
(possibly related) fact that Kripke was developing the work that went
into *Naming and Necessity* at the same time as he was lecturing and
writing on Wittgenstein, producing the material that eventually became
*Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*. Kripke is presented here
as the first of the moderns[^3], and in many ways he is, but the ways in
which he is the last (or the latest) of the ordinary language
philosophers could be a very valuable part of a history of
philosophy.[^4]

Matters are somewhat more difficult when it comes to Ryle's *The Concept
of Mind*. Ryle predicted that he would "be stigmatised as
'behaviourist'" [@Ryle1949 327] and Soames obliges, and calls him a
verificationist to boot.

> If beliefs and desires were private mental states [says Ryle], then
> we could never observe the beliefs and desires of others. But if we
> couldn't observe them, then we couldn't know that they exist, [which
> we can.] ... This argument is no stronger than verificationism in
> general, which by 1949 when *The Concept of Mind* was published, had
> been abandoned by its main proponents, the logical positivists, for
> the simple reason that every precise formulation of it had been
> decisively refuted (97-8).

But Ryle's position here isn't verificationism at all, it's
abductophobia, or fear of inference to underlying causes. Ryle doesn't
think the claim of ghosts in the machine is *meaningless*, he thinks it
is false. The kind of inference to underlying causes he disparages here
is *exactly* the kind of inference to unobservables that paradigm
verificationists, especially Ayer, go out of their way to *allow*, and
in doing so buy all end of trouble.[^5] And abductophobia is prevalent
among many contemporary *anti*-verificationists, particularly direct
realists such as @McDowell1996, @Brewer1999 and @Smith2003 who think
that if we don't directly observe beer mugs we can never be sure that
beer mugs exist. I basically agree with Soames that Ryle's argument here
(and the same style of argument recurs repeatedly in *The Concept of
Mind*) is very weak, but it's wrong to call it verificationist.

The issue of behaviourism is trickier. At one level Ryle surely is a
behaviourist, because whatever *behaviourism* means in philosophy, it
includes what Ryle says in *The Concept of Mind*. Ryle is the
reference-fixer for at least one disambiguation of *behaviourist*.
However we label Ryle's views though, it's hard to square what he says
his aims are with the aims Soames attributes to him. In particular,
consider Soames's criticism of Ryle's attempt to show that we don't need
to posit a ghost in the machine to account for talk of intelligence.
(Soames is discussing a long quote from page 47 of *The Concept of
Mind*.)

> The description Ryle gives here is judicious, and more or less
> accurate. But it is filled with words and phrases that seem to refer

> Unless all of these can be shown to be nothing more than behavioral

And Soames immediately asks

> So what are the prospects of reducing all this talk simply to talk
> about what behavior would take place in various conditions? (106)

The answer, unsurprisingly, is that the prospects aren't good. But why
this should bother *Ryle* is never made clear. For Ryle only says that
when we talk of mental properties we talk about people's dispositions,
not that we talk about their *purely behavioural* dispositions. The
latter is Soames's addition. It is rejected more or less explicitly by
Ryle in his discussion of knowing how. "Knowing *how*, then, is a
disposition, but not a single-track disposition like a reflex or a habit
... its exercises can be overt or covert, deeds performed or deeds
imagined, words spoken aloud or words heard in one's head, pictures
painted on canvas or pictures in the mind's eye." [-@Ryle1949 46-47].
Nor should Ryle feel compelled to say that these dispositions are
behavioural, given his other theoretical commitments.

Ryle is opposed in general to talk of 'reduction' as the discussion of
mechanism on pages 76ff shows. To be sure there he is talking about
reduction of laws, but he repeatedly makes clear that he regards laws
and dispositions as tightly connected [-@Ryle1949 43, 123ff] and
suggests that we use mental concepts to signal that psychological rather
than physical laws are applicable to the scenario we're discussing
(167). Moreover, he repeatedly talks about mental events for which it is
unclear there is any kind of correlated *behavioural* disposition, e.g.
the discussion of Johnson's stream of consciousness on page 58 and the
extended discussion of imagination in chapter 8. Ryle's claim that
"Silent soliloquy is a form of pregnant non-sayings" (269) hardly looks
like the claim of someone who wanted to reduce all mental talk to
behavioural dispositions, unless one leans rather hard on 'pregnant'.
But we aren't told whether Soames leans hard on this word, for he never
quite tells us why he thinks all the dispositions that Ryle considers
must be behavioural dispositions, rather than (for example) dispositions
to produce other dispositions.

To be sure, from a modern perspective it is hard to see where the space
is that Ryle aims to occupy. He wants to eliminate the ghosts, so what
is left for mind to be but physical stuff, and what does physical stuff
do but behave? He's not an eliminativist, so he's ontologically
committed to minds, and he hasn't left anything for them to be but
behavioural dispositions. So we might see it (not unfairly) but that's
not how Ryle sees it.[^6] Soames sees Ryle as an ancestor of a reductive
materialist like David Lewis, and a not very successful one at that. But
the Ryle of *The Concept of Mind* has as much in common with
non-reductive materialists, especially when he says that "not all
questions are physical questions" [-@Ryle1949 77], insists that "men are
not machines, not even ghost-ridden machines" [-@Ryle1949 81] and
describes Cartesians rather than mechanists as "the better soldiers"
[-@Ryle1949 330] in the war against ignorance. Perhaps a modern
anti-dualist should aim for a reduction of the mental to the physical,
but Ryle thought no such reduction was needed to give up the ghost, and
the historian should record this.

### Conclusion

As I said at the top, Soames has written two really valuable books. For
anyone who wants to really understand the most important philosophical
work written between 1900 and 1970, reading through the classics while
constantly referring back to Soames's books to have the complexities of
the philosophy explained will be immensely rewarding. Those who do that
might feel that the people who skip reading the classics and just read
Soames's books get an unreasonably large percentage of the benefits
they've accrued. As noted once or twice above I have some quibbles with
some points in Soames's story, but that shouldn't let us ignore what a
great service Soames has provided by providing these surveys of great
philosophical work.

[^2]: I'm grateful to many correspondants for discussions about
    Wittgenstein. They convinced me, inter alia, that it would be
    foolish of me to commit to strong views of any kind about the role
    of the synthetic a priori in Wittgenstein's later thought, and that
    the evidence is particularly messy because Wittgenstein wasn't as
    centrally concerned with these concepts as we are.

[^3]: The first of what David @Armstrong2000 has aptly called "The Age
    of Conferences".

[^4]: Just in case this gets misinterpreted, what I'm suggesting here is
    that Kripke (and his audiences) might have been influenced in
    interesting ways by philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s, *not* that
    Kripke took his ideas from those philosophers. The latter claim has
    been occasionally made, but on that 'debate'
    [@Soames1998a; @Soames1998b] I'm 100% on Soames's side.

[^5]: It would be particularly poor form of me to use a paradigm case
    argument without discussing Soames's very good dissection of
    Malcolm's paradigm case argument in chapter 7 of his book. So let me
    note my gratitude as a Cornellian for all the interesting lines of
    inquiry Soames finds suggested in Malcolm's paper -- his is a
    paradigm of charitable interpretation, a masterful discovery of
    wheat where I'd only ever seen chaff.

[^6]: Of course he *couldn't* have seen it that way since in 1949 he
    wouldn't have had the concept of ontological commitment.
