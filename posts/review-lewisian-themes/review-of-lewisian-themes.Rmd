David Lewis didn't seem particularly fond of festschrifts. He didn't
participate in the one volume of papers on his work published in his
lifetime (*Reality and Humean Supervenience*, Rowman and Littlefield
2001). He rarely contributed to festschrifts for others, in recent
decades only contributing papers to volumes in honour of his very
closest friends (David Armstrong and Hugh Mellor). I haven't done a
systematic study of this, but my casual reading suggests he didn't often
refer to papers published in festschrifts either. More generally, he
strongly favoured published in journals with blind review to publishing
in edited volumes of solicited papers.

So if there was to be a festschrift for David Lewis, as there surely
should be, it should be one put together just the way *Lewisian Themes*
was. Most of the papers for it were selected by blind refereeing, not by
inviting the usual suspects. (And the result was that several young
philosophers, even graduate students, are represented in the
collection.) The festschrift did not start life as this volume, but as
an edition of a journal. And not just any journal, but the journal that
Lewis's work most often graced: the *Australasian Journal of
Philosophy*. This volume reprints the papers from that issue, and adds
four more papers that were left out for space considerations.

The result is a marvellous collection that reflects Lewis's work in both
its quality and its breadth. Given the amount of material herein, I can
do little more than summarise the papers and present a few reflections
on what some of them tell us about the future directions for Lewisian
philosophy. Here is the list of topics covered, each of which is
followed in parentheses by the names of the authors who address that
topic.

-   Quantum Mechanics (David Lewis; David Papineau)

-   Properties (Andy Egan; Josh Parsons)

-   Truth in Fiction (Richard Hanley; Jim Mackenzie)

-   Ramseyan Humility (Rae Langton; Jonathan Schaffer)

-   Chance (Adam Elga; Ned Hall)

-   Mental Content (Robert Stalnaker; Barry Taylor; Alan Hájek and
    Philip Pettit)

-   Modal Realism (Kris McDaniel; Barry Taylor; Max Cresswell)

-   Counterpart Theory and Essentialism (Max Cresswell; L. A. Paul)

-   Similarity (Barry Taylor; David Vander Laan)

-   Holes (Roberto Casati and Achille Varzi)

-   Truth (Marian David)

-   Vagueness (Gideon Rosen and Nicholas J. J. Smith)

The breadth of the papers here is astounding. Three of the papers
(Papineau, Langton and Schaffer) respond to material of Lewis's that was
only published posthumously. Summaries of David Lewis's work normally
start by mentioning his modal realism, but this presents a somewhat
distorted picture of his interests and importance. The list here is a
better guide to the range of Lewis's work. (Though as the editors note,
it is quite incomplete because it leaves out Lewis's work on materialism
and on set theory and mereology , not to mention his work on
conditionals and on value theory and many other topics.)

The only paper directly about modal realism is McDaniel's interesting
paper on how we might formulate and defend a version of modal realism
that allows worlds to overlap. Barry Taylor's paper develops some
considerations about simplicity that suggest a worry for Lewis's
argument against linguistic ersatzism: in particular he argues against
the existence of alien universals. And Max Cresswell formulates his
discussion of counterpart theory using modal realist language. And
that's it for the discussion of modal realism, which seems about right
given its relative importance in Lewis's overall picture.

Many of the papers accept the broad outlines of Lewis's views, but
suggest alternative ways of developing the details. For instance, Andy
Egan's paper "Second Order Predication and the Metaphysics of
Properties" discusses Lewis's view that properties are sets of
individuals. Egan argues that Lewis should instead have said that
properties are functions from worlds to sets of individuals in that
world. You might think that these two views are equivalent. Let *f* be a
function that Egan calls a property, and consider the set {*x*: for some
world *w*, *x* ∈ *f*(*w*)}. Why wouldn't that set be a Lewis-style
property? Well, it would be if no object is in more than one world.
Isn't that true on Lewis's metaphysics? Not quite. Most ordinary
individuals are in one world only, but *properties* are in multiple
worlds. If the property *being red* has some property, say *being
instantiated*, in some worlds but not others, should it be a member of
the property *being instantiated* or not? Egan argues, persuasively,
that Lewis can give no good answer to this question. But on the view
that properties are functions, we can say that the function that we
identify with the property *being instantiated* maps worlds onto a set
that includes *being red* in worlds where there are red things, and a
set that does not include it in worlds where there are no red things. So
this looks like a nice fix to a technical problem for Lewis. Egan goes
on to argue that the change undermines some of Lewis's arguments against
endurantism and modal overlap.

Ned Hall discusses Lewis's widely influential theory of objective
chance. There are two disputes running through Hall's paper: the dispute
between reductionists and anti-reductionists about chance, and the
dispute between the old and new versions of the Principal Principle,
presented here as (O) and (N).

\(O\) C~0~(A \| E & ch~t~(A) = x) = x

\(N\) C~0~(A \| HL) = ch~t~(A \| L)

Here C~0~ is an initial credence function of a rational agent, ch~t~ is
the chance function at t, H is the history of the world to t, L is the
conjunction of the laws, and E is any evidence that is 'admissible' with
respect to A at t. (Evidence is admissible, roughly, if it doesn't
provide any more information about A than we get from knowing its
chance.) Lewis thought it was a cost of his reductionist position that
he was forced to give up (O) and retreat to (N). Hall suggests that it
isn't a cost, it is really something we could have derived all along.
Hall's reasoning is a little hard to follow here. He shows elegantly
that if the reductionist agrees to treat the chance function as an
expert function, then she should accept (N) rather than (O). (Roughly
speaking, to treat a function as an expert function is, as Hall says on
page 101, to consider its opinion so epistemically superior to yours
that you are disposed to defer to it. Before we can give a formal
statement of this we need to make it precise, which may not be trivial.
One of the important innovations of Hall's paper is to clarify some
importantly distinct ways of making it precise, in particular
distinguishing the cases where the expert is better informed than you
from the case where the expert is a better judge of evidence than you.)
But it is not clear how showing that the reductionist is forced to
accept (N) rather than (O), shows that it isn't a *cost* of reductionism
that it is incompatible with (O).

Hall makes two nice points about how (N) stands with respect to the
reductionist/anti‑reductionist debate. First, he notes that it isn't
clear in general how reductionists can derive (N), i.e. derive the claim
that the chance function *is* an expert function, from their general
principles. Lewis often touted it as a virtue of reductionism that such
a derivation seems possible, but Hall suggests that there will be
problems with the details here. Lewis's optimism rested on cases where
there was a close connection between chance and limiting relative
frequency, but this is not the only kind of case. Hall argues,
persuasively, that this part of the reductionist program will have
difficulties with cases where the chance of an F being a G varies
continuously with some magnitude *m* of the F (say its mass), and the
proposition A concerns whether a particular object *a*, which is an *F*
such that *m*(*a*) is unique, is also a G. (The general project of
trying to incorporate continuously variable quantities, like masses,
into Lewis's metaphysics appears to be very difficult, and there could
be some very interesting philosophical discoveries to be made in this
field.) Second, Hall notes that it is not as hard for the
anti‑reductionist to explain (N) as Lewis suggests. To be sure, the
anti-reductionist can't derive (N) from, say, metaphysical necessities
and logic. But we know that reasonable principles of inductive
rationality won't follow merely from metaphysical necessities and logic;
in addition, we need a number of substantive synthetic principles. There
is no reason why (N), or something that entails (N), cannot be among
these.

The difficulty Lewis imagines for the anti-reductionist here arises
largely from an insufficient attention to epistemology. Lewis never took
epistemology (at least informal epistemology) as seriously as he took
metaphysics, philosophy of mind, or philosophy of language, and
occasionally this shows up in the papers here. Jonathan Schaffer's paper
"Quiddistic Knowledge" argues that there is no plausible epistemological
theory that grounds Lewis's claim in "Ramseyan Humility" that "we are
irredemiably ignorant about the identities of the fundamental
properties." And Robert Stalnaker in "Lewis on Intentionality" argues
that Lewis's content internalism derives from an implausible commitment
to epistemological internalism.

There are of course many more good ideas throughout this volume. For
example, Marian David has a thorough, and thoroughly convincing,
response to Lewis's argument that the correspondence theory of truth is
not a competitor to the redundancy theory of truth. Max Cresswell
provides a few reasons for thinking that the counterpart relation has to
be an equivalence relation, in which case we may as well do without
counterpart theory. (Cresswell's paper and the recent paper on a similar
topic by Michael Fara and Timothy Williamson, "Counterparts and
Actuality", *Mind* 114: 1-30, complement each other nicely, and should
be required reading for anyone interested in debates about counterpart
theory.) Alan Hájek and Philip Pettit argue that Lewis's argument
against the view that desires are beliefs about what is good assumes
that goodness is not an 'indexical' property, and that this might fail
if what is good is partially a function of, say, our evidence, as on the
view that what is good is what maximises *expected* utility. And there
are many more gems like these.

It is a great compliment to Lewis's style as a philosopher that, as we
see in this collection, Lewis amassed a great number of admirers who
thought the best way to honour his work was to criticise it in every way
imaginable. It is sad to stop and think how much we would have learned
from hearing Lewis's responses.
