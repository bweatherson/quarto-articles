So, it seems that a good epistemic consequentialist will take the bribe. But, doesn't that seem like the height of epistemic irresponsibility? It means choosing to believe that *C*~0~ is certainly false when you have conclusive evidence for thinking that it is true. If you see the child on the lawn in front of you, how can you sanction believing she is not there?

As Greaves admits, intuitions are divided here. Some consequentialists might think that "epistemic bribes" are at least sometimes worth taking, while those of a more deontological bent will always find such trade-offs "beyond the pale"  [@Berker2013b 363]. We will largely sidestep these contentious issues here, though our argument will offer comfort to epistemic consequentialists who feel queasy about accepting the bribe offered in Imps. We contend that, when inaccuracy is measured properly, the consequences of adopting the **cred~2~** credences are strictly worse than the consequences of adopting **cred~1~**.

The basic problem is that Imps cherry-picks propositions in a way no consequentialist should condone. Its persuasive force rests on the assumption that, for purposes of epistemic evaluation, nothing matters except the accuracies of the credences assigned to propositions in the target set $\mathscr{X}$. But $\mathscr{X}$ is the wrong target! By confining attention to it Greaves ignores the many other credences to which Emily becomes committed as a consequence of adopting **cred~1~** or **cred~2~**. Any (coherent) agent who invests credence zero in *C*~0~ must also invest credence zero in any proposition *C*~0~ Λ *Y*, where *Y* is any conjunction or disjunction of elements from $\mathscr{X}$. Likewise, anyone who invests credence one in *C~n~* must invest credence one in any proposition *C~n~ \vee Y*, where *Y* is any conjunction or disjunction from $\mathscr{X}$. In the current context (where the probabilities of the various *C~i~* are independent), when Emily adopts a credence function over $\mathscr{X}$ she commits to having a credence for (i) every atomic proposition ±*C*~0~ Λ ±*C*~1~ Λ ±*C*~2~ Λ … Λ ±*C*~10~, where '±' can be either an affirmation or a negation, and (ii) every disjunction of these atomic propositions. In short, she commits to having credences over the whole Boolean algebra *\mathscr{A}_\mathscr{X}* generated by $\mathscr{X}$. Since each event of a child coming out is independent, adopting **cred~1~** will commit her to setting **cred~1~**(±*C*~0~ Λ ±*C*~1~ Λ ±*C*~2~ Λ … Λ ±*C*~10~ ) = \frac{1}{1024}* when *C*~0~ is affirmed, and 0 when it is negated. While adopting **cred~2~** commits her to setting **cred~2~**(±*C*~0~ Λ ±*C*~1~ Λ ±*C*~2~ Λ … Λ ±*C*~10~ *) equal to 1 when *C*~0~ is negated and the rest of the **C~i~** are affirmed, and to 0 otherwise. In this way, each of these probability assignments over the 2048 atoms determine a definite probability for every one of the *2^{2048}* propositions in *\mathscr{A}_\mathscr{X}*.

It is our view that consequentialists should reject any assessment of epistemic utility that fails to take the accuracies of *all* these credences into account. All are consequences of adopting **cred~1~** or **cred~2~**, and so all should be part of any consequentialist evaluation of the quality of those credal states. The right "target set" to use when computing epistemic disutility is not $\mathscr{X}$ but *\mathscr{A}_\mathscr{X}*. If we don't do that, we ignore most of the ways in which **cred~1~** and **cred~2~** differ in accuracy. If Emily takes the bribe, she goes from having credence 0.5 in *C*~0~ \leftrightarrow C_1* to having credence 0 in it. And that's unfortunate, because the chance of *C*~0~ \leftrightarrow C_1* goes from 0.5 to 1. This is another proposition, as well as *C*~0~, that Emily acquires a false belief in by taking the bribe. Of course, there are other propositions not counted that go the other way. Originally, Emily has a credence of 0.25 in *C*~1~ Λ C_2*, and its chance is also 0.25. After taking the bribe, this has a chance of 1, and her credence in it is 1. That's an improvement in accuracy. So there are a host of both improvements and deteriorations that are as yet unaccounted for. We should account for them, and making the target set be *\mathscr{A}_\mathscr{X}* does that.

When seen from this broader perspective, it turns out the seeming superiority of **cred~2~** over **cred~1~** evaporates. The rest of this section (and the appendix) is dedicated to demonstrating this. We'll make the calculations a little easier on ourselves by relying on a theorem concerning Brier scores for coherent agents. Assume, as is the case here, that Emily's credences are defined over an atomic Boolean alegbra of propositions. The atoms are the 'worlds', or states that are maximially specific with respect to the puzzle at hand. In this case there are 2048 states, which we'll label *s_0* through *s_{2047}*. In *s_k*, the first child is on the lawn iff *k \leq 1023*, and summerhouse child *i* comes out iff the (*i* + 1)th digit in the binary expansion of *k* is 1. Let *\mathscr{S}_\mathscr{X}* be the set of all these states. That's not a terrible target set; as long as Emily is probabilistically coherent it is comprehensive. The theorem in question says that for any credence function **cred** defined over a partition of states *\mathscr{S}*, and over the algebra *\mathscr{A}* generated by those states,

Theorem-1

:    ***{Brier}_{\mathscr{A}}(**{cred}, @) = \frac{|\mathscr{S}|}{4}**{Brier}_{\mathscr{S}}(**{cred}, @)*

<aside>Alejandro Pérez Carballo gives a more direct and elegant proof of this result in a recent manuscript. We have kept our inefficient proof since its structure provides a guide for the proof of Theorem-3.</aside>

To prove this we rely on a series of lemmas.

Let $\mathscr{A}$ be the algebra generated by a finite partition of states *\mathscr{S}= \{s_1, s_2, …, s_N\}*. \@ is a truth-value assignment for propositions in $\mathscr{A}$. For simplicity, assume *s_1* is the true state, so that \@(*s_1*) = 1 and \@(*s_n*) = 0 for *n > 1*. The credence function *C** assigns values of *c~1~, c~2~, …, c_{N-1}, C~n~* to the elements of $\mathscr{S}$, where *\sum^{N}_{n=1} C~n~ = 1* in virtue of coherence.

It will be convenient to start by partitioning $\mathscr{A}$ into four "quadrants". Let *B* range over all disjunctions with disjunctions drawn from *\mathscr{B}= \{s_2, s_3, …, s_{N-1}\}* (including the empty disjunction, i.e., the logical contradition *\bot*). Then, $\mathscr{A}$ can be split into four disjoint parts:

$\mathscr{A}_1 = \{B \vee s_1 \vee s_N: B$ a disjunction of the elements of $\mathscr{B}\}$  
$\mathscr{A}_2 = \{B \vee s_1: B$ a disjunction of the elements of *\mathscr{B}\}$  
$\mathscr{A}_3 = \{B \vee s_N: B$ a disjunction of the elements of *\mathscr{B}\}$  
$\mathscr{A}_4 = \{B: B$ a disjunction of the elements of *\mathscr{B}\}$

Notice that:

$\mathscr{A}_1 \cup \mathscr{A}_2$ contains all and only the true propositions in $\mathscr{A}$.  
$\mathscr{A}_3 \cup \mathscr{A}_4$*$ contains all and only the false propositions in $\mathscr{A}$.  
$\mathscr{A}_1$*$ and $\mathscr{A}_4$ are *complementary* sets, i.e., all elements of $\mathscr{A}_4$ are negations of elements of $\mathscr{A}_1$, and conversely.  
$\mathscr{A}_2$ and $\mathscr{A}_3$ are also complementary.  
$\mathscr{A}_1 \cup \mathscr{A}_4$ is the subalgebra of $\mathscr{A}$ generated by \{*s*~1~ ∨ *s~N~*, *s*~2~, *s*~3~, …, *s*~*N*-1~\}.

All four quadrants have the same cardinality of 2^*N*-2^.

For an additive scoring rule **I**(**c**, \@) = $\sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}}\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{c}(A), @(A))$ and *j* = 1, 2, 3, 4, define **I**~j~ = $\sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}_j}\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{c}(A), @(A))$, and note that **I**(**c**, \@) = 2^-*N*^(**I**_1 + **I**_2 + **I**_3 + **I**_4)*.

Lemma-1.1
:    If *\textbf{I}* is negation symmetric, i.e., if **i**(**c**(¬ A), @(¬ A)) = **{i}(**c**(A), @(A))* for all *A*, then ***{I}_1 = **{I}_4* and ***{I}_2 = **{I}_3*, and ***{I}(**c**,@) = 2^{1-N}(**{I}_2 + **{I}_4)*.

*Proof*  
This is a direct consequence of the fact that $\mathscr{A}_1* is complementary to $\mathscr{A}_4* and that $\mathscr{A}_2* is complementary to $\mathscr{A}_3* since this allows us to write

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{I}_1(\mathbf{c},@) &= \sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}_1} \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{c}(A), @(A)) = \sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}_1} \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{c}(¬ A), @(¬ A)) = \mathbf{I}_4(\mathbf{c},@). \\
\mathbf{I}_3(\mathbf{c},@) &= \sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}_3} \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{c}(A), @(A)) = \sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}_3} \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{c}(¬ A), @(¬ A)) = \mathbf{I}_2(\mathbf{c},@). \text{ QED}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Applying Lemma 1.1 with **I** = **Brier** we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\#)\quad \mathbf{Brier}_{\mathscr{A}}(\mathbf{c}, @) &= 2^{1-N} \sum_{A \in \mathscr{A}} (@(A) - c(A))^2 \\
 &= 2^{1-N} \sum_B [(1-c~1~)^2 - 2(1-c~1~)\mathbf{c}(B) + \mathbf{c}(B)^2]
 \end{aligned}
$$
 
since

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Brier}_2 &= \sum_B[1 - \mathbf{c}(B \vee s_1)]^2 &&= \sum_B[(1 - c~1~) - \mathbf{c}(B)]^2 \\
& &&= \sum_B [(1-c~1~)^2 - 2(1-c~1~)\mathbf{c}(B) + \mathbf{c}(B)^2] \\
\mathbf{Brier}_4 &= \sum_B \mathbf{c}(B)^2 && \quad
\end{aligned}
$$

Lemma-1.2
:    $$
     \begin{aligned}
     (\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} C~n~)^2 &= \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + 2 \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j
     \end{aligned}
     $$

Proof by induction. Easy.

Lemma-1.3
:     $$
      \begin{aligned}
       \mathbf{Brier}_{\mathscr{S}}(\mathbf{c},@) &= \frac{2}{N}[(1-c~1~)^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2  - (1-c~1~)(\sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~) + \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j]
       \end{aligned}
       $$

*Proof*  
Using the definition of the Brier score and the fact that *s_1* is true, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Brier}_{\mathscr{S}}(\mathbf{c},@) &= \frac{1}{N}[(1 - c~1~)^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + (1 - \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}C~n~)^2] \\
&= \frac{1}{N}[(1 - c~1~)^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + ((1 -c~1~) - \sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~)^2] \\
&= \frac{1}{N}[(1 - c~1~)^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + (1 -c~1~)^2 - 2(1 - c~1~) \sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~ + (\sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~)^2] \\
&= \frac{1}{N}[(1 - c~1~)^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + (1 -c~1~)^2 - 2(1 - c~1~) \sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~  \\
&\quad \quad +\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + 2 \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j] \quad \text{(Lemma-1.2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then grouping like terms and factoring out 2 yields the desired result. QED

Lemma-1.4
:    $$
     \begin{aligned}
     \sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~ &= 2^{3-N}\sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}\mathbf{c}(B)
     \end{aligned}
     $$

*Proof*  
For each *n = 2, 3, …, N-1*, each *s_n* appears in half of the *2^{N-2}* disjunctions with disjuncts drawn from *\mathscr{B}*. As a result, each *C~n~* appears as a summand *2^{N-3}* times among the sums that express the various ***{c}(B)*. So *\sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}**{c}(B) = 2^{N-3}\sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~*. QED

Lemma-1.5
:     **
      \begin{aligned}
      \sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}**{c}(B)^2 &= 2^{N-3}[\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j]
      \end{aligned}
      **

*Proof*  
We proceed by induction starting with the first meaningful case of *N=4*, where calculation shows *\sum_B**{c}(B)^2 = (c~2~ + c_3)^2 + c{_2}^2 + c{_3}^2 = 2[c{_2}^2 + c{_3}^2 + c~2~c_3]*. Now, assume the identity holds for disjunctions *B* of elements of *\mathscr{B}* and show that it holds for disjunctions *A* of elements of *\mathscr{B}\cup \{s_N\}*.

**
\begin{aligned}
\sum_A**{c}(A)^2 &= \sum_B**{c}(B)^2 + \sum_B**{c}(B \vee s_N)^2 \\
&= \sum_B**{c}(B)^2 + \sum_B(**{c}(B)^2 + 2C~n~**{c}(B) + c{_N}^2)\\
&= 2\sum_B**{c}(B)^2 + 2C~n~\sum_B**{c}(B) + \sum_Bc{_N}^2 \\
&= 2 \cdot 2^{N-3}[\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j] + 2C~n~\sum_B**{c}(B) + \sum_Bc{_N}^2 &&\text{(Induction Hypothesis)}\\
&= 2^{N-2}[\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j] + 2^{N-2}C~n~\sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~ + \sum_Bc{_N}^2 &&\text{(Lemma-1.4)} \\
&= 2^{N-2}[\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} c{_n}^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-2} \sum_{j>n}^{N-1}C~n~c_j] + 2^{N-2}C~n~\sum_{n=2}^{N-1}C~n~ + 2^{N-2}c{_N}^2 &&\text{Since *|\mathscr{B}| = 2^{N-2}*} \\
&= 2^{N-2}[\sum_{n=2}^{N} c{_n}^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} \sum_{j>n}^{N}C~n~c_j] && \text{ QED}
\end{aligned}
** 

Plugging the results of the last two lemmas into Lemma-1.3 produces a result of

**
\begin{aligned}
**{Brier}_{\mathscr{S}}(\textbf{c},@) &= \frac{2}{N}[(1-c~1~)^2 + 2^{3-N}\sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}**{c}(B)^2 - 2^{3-N}(1-c~1~)\sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}**{c}(B)] \\
&= \frac{2}{N}\sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}[2^{2-N}(1-c~1~)^2 + 2^{3-N}**{c}(B)^2 - 2^{3-N}(1-c~1~)**{c}(B)] \\
&= \frac{2^{3-N}}{N}\sum_{B \in \mathscr{B}}[(1 - c~1~)^2 + 2**{c}(B)^2 - 2(1-c~1~)**{c}(B)]
\end{aligned}
** 

Comparing this to (\#) we see that it is just *\frac{N}{4}* times Brier*_\mathscr{S}(**{c},@)*, as we aimed to prove. QED.

Theorem-2
:    When inaccuracy over $\mathscr{A}$ is measured using the Brier score, the least accurate credal states are those which assign credence 1 to some false atom of $\mathscr{A}$.

*Proof*  
As before, suppose that *@(s_1) = 1*, and let *C** be a credence function that assigns credence 1 to some false atom *s_2, s_3,..., s_N* of $\mathscr{A}$. In light of Theorem-1 it suffices to show that ***{Brier}_\mathscr{S}(**{c}, @) > **{Brier}_\mathscr{S}(**{b}, @)* where **b** does not assign credence 1 to any false atom. Start by noting that for any credence function *\pi* defined on the atoms of $\mathscr{A}$ one has

**
\begin{aligned}
**{Brier}_\mathscr{S}(\pi,@) &= \frac{1}{N}[(1-\pi_1)^2 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1}\pi{_n}^2+ (1-\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\pi{_n})^2] \\
&= \frac{1}{N}[1 - 2\pi_1 + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\pi{_n}^2+ (1-\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\pi{_n})^2]
\end{aligned}
**

But, since each *\pi_n \in [0, 1]* is non-negative, it follows that *\pi_1 \geq \pi{_1}^2, \pi_2 \geq \pi{_2}^2, …, \pi_N \geq \pi{_N}^2* with the inequality strict in each case unless *\pi_n* is either 1 or 0.

This means that the sum *\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\pi{_n}^2+ (1-\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\pi{_n})^2* is less than or equal to 1, with equality if and only if exactly one of the atoms *s_n* is assigned probability 1 (and the rest have probability zero). As a result, **Brier***_\mathscr{S}(\pi, @) \leq \frac{2}{N}(1 - \pi_1)* with equality if and only if exactly one of the atoms *s_n* is assigned probability 1. So, there are three relevant cases:

If *\pi* assigns some false atom probability 1, **Brier***_\mathscr{S}(\pi, @) = \frac{2}{N}\cdot(1 - 0) = \frac{2}{N}*.

If *\pi* assigns the true atom probability 1, **Brier***_\mathscr{S}(\pi, @) = \frac{2}{N}\cdot(1 - 1) = 0*.

If *\pi* does not assign any atom probability 1, **Brier***_\mathscr{S}(\pi, @) < \frac{2}{N}\cdot(1 - c~1~) \leq \frac{2}{N}*.

So, since *C** fits case (i) and **b** fits case (ii) or (iii) we have the desired result. QED

Theorem-3
:    Let $\mathscr{A}$ be an algebra of propositions generated by atoms *a_1, ..., a_{2N}*, where *a_1* is the truth. Let *P* and *Q* be probability functions defined on $\mathscr{A}$. *P* assigns all its mass to the first *N* atoms, so that *P(a_1 \vee … \vee a_N) = 1*, and it also assigns some positive probability to *a_1*. *Q* assigns all its mass to the false atom *a_{2N}*, so that *Q(a_{2N}) = 1*. Then, for any proper score **I** satisfying Truth-directedness, Extensionality and Negation Symmetry we have ***{I}(v_1, P) < **{I}(v_1, Q)* where *v_1* is the truth-value assignment associated with *a_1* (i.e., where *v_1(X) = 1* if and only if *a_1* entails *X*).

*Proof*  
We can divide the algebra $\mathscr{A}$ into four quadrants 

**
\begin{aligned}
\mathscr{A}^1 &= \{X \in \mathscr{A}: a_1 \vDash X \text{ and } a_{2N} \vDash X\} \\
\mathscr{A}^2 &= \{X \in \mathscr{A}: a_1 \vDash X \text{ and } a_{2N} \nvDash X\} \\
\mathscr{A}^3 &= \{X \in \mathscr{A}: a_1 \nvDash X \text{ and } a_{2N} \vDash X\} \\
\mathscr{A}^4 &= \{X \in \mathscr{A}: a_1 \nvDash X \text{ and } a_{2N} \nvDash X\}
\end{aligned}
** 

We know the following:

-   *Q* is maximally accurate on *\mathscr{A}^1 \cup \mathscr{A}^4*. Every proposition in *\mathscr{A}^1* is true, and *Q* assigns it a probability of 1. Every proposition in *\mathscr{A}^4* is false, and *Q* assigns it a probability of 0.
-   *Q* is maximally inaccurate on *\mathscr{A}^2 \cup \mathscr{A}^3*. Every proposition in *\mathscr{A}^2* is true, and *Q* assigns it a probability of 0. Every proposition in *\mathscr{A}^3* is false, and *Q* assigns it a probability of 1.
-   *P* is maximally accurate on *\mathscr{A}^3 \cup \mathscr{A}^4*. Every proposition in *\mathscr{A}^3 \cup \mathscr{A}^4* is false, and *P* assigns it a probability of 0.
-   Each quadrant has *2^{2N-2}* elements.

Lemma-3.1
:   When *a_1* is true, the accuracy score of *P* over the propositions in *\mathscr{A}^1* is identical to the accuracy score of *P* over the propositions in *\mathscr{A}^2*.

*Proof*  
Note first that the function *F: \mathscr{A}^1 \rightarrow \mathscr{A}^2* that takes *X* to *X ∧ ¬ a_{2N}* is a bijection of *\mathscr{A}^1* onto *\mathscr{A}^2*. Since every proposition in *\mathscr{A}^1 \cup \mathscr{A}^2* is true, we can then write the respective accuracy scores of *\mathscr{A}^1* and *\mathscr{A}^2* as 

**
\begin{aligned}
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^1}(a_1, P) &= 2^{2-2N} \cdot \sum_{X \in \mathscr{A}^1} **{I}(1, P(X)) \\
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P) &= 2^{2-2N} \cdot \sum_{X \in \mathscr{A}^1} **{I}(1, P(X \wedge ¬ a_{2N}))
\end{aligned}
** 

Note: *X* ranges over *\mathscr{A}^1* in both summations. But since *P(a_{2N}) = 0* we have *P(X) = P(X ∧ a_{2N})* for each *X* in *\mathscr{A}^1*. Since **I** is extensional, this means that ***{I}(1, P(X)) = **{I}(1, P(X ∧ a_{2N}))* for each *X* in *\mathscr{A}^1*. And, it follows that ***{I}_{\mathscr{A}^1}(a_1, P)* and ***{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P)* are identical. (Note that even if *P(a_{2N}) > 0*, Truth-directedness entails that ***{I}_{\mathscr{A}^1}(a_1, P) < **{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P)*.)

Lemma-3.2
:    When *a_1* is true, the accuracy score of *Q* over *\mathscr{A}^2* is identical to the accuracy score of *Q* over *\mathscr{A}^3*.

*Proof*  
To see this, note first that the function *G: \mathscr{A}^2 \rightarrow \mathscr{A}^3* that takes *X* to *G(X) = ¬ X* is a bijection (i.e., the negation of everything in *\mathscr{A}^2* is in *\mathscr{A}^3* and vice-versa). This, together with the fact that *\mathscr{A}^2* contains only truths and *\mathscr{A}^3* contains only falsehoods, lets us write 

**
\begin{aligned}
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, Q) &= 2^{2-2N} \cdot \sum_{X \in \mathscr{A}^2} **{I}(1, Q(X)) \\
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^3}(a_1, Q) &= 2^{2-2N} \cdot \sum_{X \in \mathscr{A}^2} **{I}(0, Q(¬ X))
\end{aligned}
** 

But since **I** is negation symmetric, ***{I}(1, Q(X)) = **{I}(0, Q(¬ X))* for every *X*, which means that ***{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, Q) = **{I}_{\mathscr{A}^3}(a_1, Q)*. (Note that this proof made no assumptions about *Q* except that it was a probability.)

Lemma-3.3
:    If *P(a_1) > 0*, the accuracy score of *P* over *\mathscr{A}^2* is strictly less than the accuracy score of *Q* over *\mathscr{A}^2*.

*Proof*  
Since *Q(X) = 0* everywhere on *\mathscr{A}^2* we have **\begin{aligned}
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P) &= 2^{2-2N} \cdot \sum_{X \in \mathscr{A}^2} **{I}(1, P(X)) \\
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, Q) &= 2^{2-2N} \cdot \sum_{X \in \mathscr{A}^2} **{I}(1, 0) 
\end{aligned}
** 

But, by Truth Directedness ***{I}(1, 0) > **{I}(1, P(X))* since *P(a_1) > 0* implies that *P(X) > 0* for all *X \in \mathscr{A}^2*. Thus ***{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, Q) > **{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P)*.

To complete the proof of the theorem we need only note that 

**
\begin{aligned}
**{I}_{\mathscr{A}}(a_1, P) &= \frac{**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^1}(a_1, P)}{4} + \frac{**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P)}{4} &\text{(since }P\text{ is perfect on }\mathscr{A}^3 \cup \mathscr{A}^4) \\
&= \frac{**{I}_{\mathscr{A}^2}(a_1, P)}{2} &\text{Lemma-3.1} \\
