Data about attitude reports provide some of the most interesting
arguments for, and against, various theses of semantic relativism. This
paper is a short survey of three such arguments. First, I'll argue
(against recent work by von Fintel and Gillies) that relativists can
explain the behaviour of relativistic terms in factive attitude reports.
Second, I'll argue (against Glanzberg) that looking at attitude reports
suggests that relativists have a *more* plausible story to tell than
contextualists about the division of labour between semantics and
meta-semantics. Finally, I'll offer a new argument for invariantism
(i.e. against both relativism and contextualism) about moral terms. The
argument will turn on the observation that the behaviour of normative
terms in factive and non-factive attitude reports is quite unlike the
behaviour of any other plausibly context-sensitive term. Before that,
I'll start with some taxonomy, just so as it's clear what the intended
conclusions below are supposed to be.

### How Not to be a Strawman

Here are three mappings that we, as theorists about language, might be
interested in.

-   **Physical Movements** $\rightarrow$ **Speech Acts**. I'm currently
    moving my fingers across a keyboard. In doing so, I'm making various
    assertions. It's a hard question to say just how I manage to make an
    assertion by moving my fingers in this way. Relatedly, it's a hard
    question to say just which assertions, requests, questions, commands
    etc people make by making physical movements. This mapping is the
    answer to that question.

-   **Speech Acts** $\rightarrow$ **Contents**. For some speech acts,
    their content is clear. If I assert that grass is green, the content
    of my assertion is that grass is green. For other speech acts,
    including perhaps other assertions, it is not immediately obvious
    what their content is. This mapping answers that question.

-   **Contents** $\rightarrow$ **Truth Values**. Given a content, it
    isn't always clear whether it is true or false (or perhaps something
    else). This mapping provides the truth values of every content of
    every speech act.

The details of each of these mappings is interesting, to say the least.
Indeed, a full description of those mappings would arguably include an
answer to every question ever asked. We're not likely to know that any
time soon. But we can ask, and perhaps answer, interesting questions
about the topology of the mappings. Here are two distinct questions we
can ask about each of the three mappings.

-   **Is it one-one or one-many?** The mapping from a natural number to
    its natural predecessor is one-one. That's to say, every number is
    mapped to at most one other number. The mapping from a person to the
    children they have is one-many. That's not to say that everyone has
    many children, or indeed that everyone has any children. It's merely
    to say that some things in the domain are mapped to many things in
    the range.

-   **Is the mapping absolute or relative, and if relative, relative to
    what?** Consider a mapping that takes a person A as input, and
    relative to any person B, outputs the first child that A has with B.
    This mapping is relative; there's no such thing as the output of the
    function for any particular input A. All there is, is the output
    relative to B1, relative to B2, and so on. But note that in a good
    sense the mapping is one-one. Relative to any B, A is mapped to at
    most one person.

A very simple model of context-sensitivity in language says that all
three of these mappings are one-one and absolute. It will be helpful to
have a character who accepts that, so imagine we have a person, called
Strawman, who does. There are six basic ways to reject Strawman's views.
For each of the three mappings, we can say that it is one-many or we can
say that it is relative.

This way of thinking about Strawman's opponents gives us a nice
taxonomy. The first mapping is about *speech acts*, the second about
*contents* and the third about *truth*. Someone who disagrees with
Strawman disagrees about one of these three mappings. They might
disagree by being a *pluralist*, i.e. thinking that the mapping is
one-many. Or they might disagree by being a *relativist*, i.e. thinking
the mapping is relative to some thing external. The respective defenders
of Strawman on these questions are the *monists* and the *absolutists*.

So the *speech act pluralist* is the person who thinks the first mapping
is one-many. The *content relativist*, is the person who thinks the
second is relative to some other variable (perhaps an assessor). And the
*truth monist* is the person who thinks that contents have (at most) one
truth value. All these terms are a little bit stipulative, but I think
it the terminology here somewhat matches up with regular use. And it's
the terminology I'll use throughout this paper.

One other nice advantage of this taxonomy is that it helps clarify just
what is at issue between various opponents of Strawman. So Andy
@Egan2009-EGABBA has some data about uses of "you" in group settings
that suggest such utterances pose a problem for Strawman. But it's one
thing to have evidence that Strawman is wrong, another altogether to
know which of his views is, on a particular occasion, wrong. I think
separating out Strawman's various commitments helps clarify what is
needed to isolate Strawman's mistake on an occasion.

It is, I think, more or less common ground that the first of Strawman's
commitments, speech act monism, is false. The King can, by uttering
"It's cold in here", both assert that it's cold in here, and command his
lackey to close the window. Those look like two distinct speech acts
that he's made with the one physical movement. Herman Cappellen and
Ernest Lepore [@Cappelen2005] have many more examples to show that
Strawman is wrong here. Once we go beyond that though, it's less clear
that Strawman is mistaken. Perhaps by thinking about cases where, by the
one physical movement, we intend to communicate *p* to one audience
member, and *q* to another, we can try to motivate speech-act
relativism. That's an issue I'll leave for another day. In contrast to
what he says about speech acts, what Strawman says about content and
truth is, if not universally accepted, at least popular. So I'll call
*orthodox contextualism* the view that Strawman is right about the
content mapping and the truth mapping; each mapping is both one-one and
absolute.

It is worthwhile noting two very separate models for content that lead
to two quite distinct ways in which we can reject Strawman's last two
absolutist views. John MacFarlane's paper on Non-Indexical Contextualism
@MacFarlane2009-MACNC was extremely useful in setting up the relevant
distinctions here, but the particular models for content I'm describing
here are both set out in greatest detail in recent work by Andy Egan.

The first is the centred worlds model for content. This is the idea that
for some utterance types, any token of that type expresses the same
content. But that content is a set of centred worlds, that is true at
some centres and false at other centres in the same world. So we might
think that the content of "Beer is tasty" is, roughly, the set of
possibilia who have pro-attitudes to the taste of beer. More precisely,
it is the set of world-centre pairs such that the agent at (or perhaps
closest to) the centre has pro-attitudes towards the taste of beer. On
this view, content monism will be maintained -- what an utterance of
"Beer is tasty" says is invariant across assessors. (I'm assuming here
that assessor-relativity is the only relativity we're interested in.)
But truth absolutism will fail, since whether that content is true for
*a*~1~ and *a*~2~ will depend on what their attitudes are towards beer.
This kind of centred worlds model for content is what Egan has developed
in [@Egan2007-EGAEMR].

The second model lets assessors get into the content-fixing mechanism,
but says the content that is fixed is a familiar proposition whose truth
is not assessor relative. This is easiest to explain with an example
involving second-person pronouns. For some utterances of "You are a
fool", the content of that utterance, relative to *x*, is that *x* is a
fool. Now whether *x* is indeed a fool is a simple factual question, and
whether it is true isn't assessor relative. But if some people are fools
and others are not, whether the utterance is true or false depends on
who is assessing it. So content relativism is true, while truth
absolutism is preserved. This is a view Egan has defended for some
tokens of second person pronouns [@Egan2009-EGABBA] .

In "Conditionals and Indexical Relativism" [@Weatherson2009-WEACAI], I
called the combination of content relativism and truth absolutism
"indexical relativism", and defended such a view about indicative
conditionals. I called something similar to the combination of truth
relativism and content absolutism "non-indexical contextualism". More
precisely, I followed MacFarlane in using that phrase for the
combination of truth relativism and content absolutism and the view that
whether a speaker's utterance is true (relative to an assessor) is a
matter of whether the proposition they express is true relative to their
context. I like the name "indexical relativism", but it has also been
used for theories that aren't even heterodox in the above sense, so
perhaps persisting with it would just invite confusion. (And the name
implies a particular view about how the relativity works; namely that
there is something like an indexical element in what's asserted that
gets its value from the context of assessment.) In other contexts I've
used "relativism" as the label for all and only heterodox views, but
this label is potentially quite confusing. Indeed, it's a possible worry
about the arguments in my "Conditionals and Indexical Relativism" that
they really just support heterodoxy; a separate argument would be needed
(and might not be easy to supply) against pluralist alternatives to
content relativism about indicative conditionals.

### Factive Verbs and Relativism

In "CIA Leaks" [@vonFintel2008], Kai von Fintel and Thony Gillies raise
a problem for heterodox theories about 'might'. (Actually they raise
several, but I'm only going to deal with one of them here.) Their
primary target is what I called truth relativist theories, but the
argument they raise is interesting to consider from all heterodox
perspectives. The problem concerns embedding of 'might'-clauses under
factive attitude verbs. They argue as follows:

1.  *S realises that p* presupposes that *p*.

2.  This presupposition is carried over when the sentence is used as the
    antecedent of a conditional. So, for instance, *If S realises that
    p, then q* presupposes that *p*.

3.  But, on standard heterodox proposals, we can properly say *If S
    realises that it might be that p, then q*, even though it isn't true
    that it might be that *p*.

4.  So heterodox proposals are false.

Here is the example they use to make the case.

> Bond planted a bug and some misleading evidence pointing to his being
> in Zuurich and slipped out. Now he and Leiter are listening in from
> London. As they listen, Leiter is getting a bit worried: Blofeld
> hasn't yet found the misleading evidence that points to Bond's being
> in Zurich. Leiter turns to Bond and says:
>
> 1.  If Blofeld realizes you might be in Zurich, you can breathe
>     easy---he'll send his henchman to Zurich to find you. (93)
>
> Now the problem is that for the heterodox theorist, "You might be in
> Zurich", as uttered by Leiter to Bond, expresses (relative to Bond), a
> proposition that is true iff for all Bond knows, Bond might be in
> Zurich. Just how it does this will differ for different heterodox
> theorists, but so far they all agree. But that isn't the case; since
> Bond knows he is in London. So (34) should sound defective, since it
> contains a presupposition failure. But it isn't defective, so
> heterodoxy is mistaken.

Before we look at how heterodox theorists might respond to this case,
it's worth looking thinking about how Strawman might respond to it. The
simplest idea is to say that in *It might be that p*, there is a hidden
variable *X*. The value of *X* is set by context. And the sentence
expresses the proposition that for all *X* knows, *p* is true. (Perhaps
we might use some epistemic relation other than 'knows', but that's not
relevant here.)

Now, and this is crucial, the variable *X* might be either free or
bound. If there is nothing around to bind it, as in a simple utterance
of *It might be that p*, then it will be free. And typically if it is
free, *X* denotes a group consisting of the speaker and perhaps those in
the same conversation. But when the might-clause is embedded under a
propositional attitude ascription (factive or not), the variable *X*
will be bound to the subject of the attitude ascription. So in *Y
believes that it might be that p*, the value of *X* will simply be *Y*.
So in *Blofeld realises you might be in Zurich*, the value of *X* is
Blofeld. And hence the embedded might claim is true, since that claim is
simply that for all Blofeld knows, Bond is in Zurich. Which, in the
story, is true.

The reason for going through all of this is that the theorist who
accepts truth absolutism, but rejects content absolutism, can say
exactly the same thing. There is a variable *X* in the structure of
what's asserted. Strawman thinks that you only get a determinate
assertion when you fill in the value of *X*. We can disagree with that;
we can say that an assertion can literally contain a variable, one that
potentially gets its value from assessors. That way the content of a
particular assertion can be different for different assessors. Once
we've made this move, we can rejoin Strawman's story. This variable is
either free or bound. If it is bound, we tell exactly the same story as
Strawman. But, we insist, if it is free, the value of *X* is sometimes
set by contextual features of the hearer as well as of the assessor. In
the standard case, *X* is a group consisting of the speaker, the hearer,
and perhaps some people who get in the group in virtue of their
proximity to the speaker or hearer.

So we end up saying the same thing about the acceptability of (34) as
Strawman. The content of *You might be in Zurich,* as embedded in (34),
is quite different to the content those words would have if uttered as a
standalone sentence, because the value that a key variable takes is
different. For us, the value that variable takes differs for different
assessors, but that's completely irrelevant to the explanation of the
acceptability of (34).

For the truth relativist (who is also a content absolutist) things are a
little more interesting. Such a theorist will typically reject the
presence of a variable like X in the structure of what is said. So they
cannot appeal to the kind of explanation that we've offered (twice over)
for how (34) may be acceptable. The solution is to simply reject the
generalisation about factive verbs. Let's start with some seemingly
distant examples, in particular examples about fiction. It seems that
(5) doesn't have any false presuppositions.

5.  Watson realised that private detectives were (in late 19th Century
    London) better at solving murder mysteries than police.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
6.  Had Watson realised earlier that private detectives were better at
    solving murder mysteries than police, he would have liked Holmes
    more than he did.

7.  Had Watson realised earlier that private detectives were better at
    solving murder mysteries than police, the early chapters of the book
    would have been more interesting.

Note that this isn't anything particular to do with subjunctive
conditionals. Imagine that we are settling down to watch a new
adaptation of the Holmes stories that we are told won't be particularly
faithful to the books in detail. I might properly say (8).

8.  If Watson realises that private detectives were better at solving
    murder mysteries than police, the early scenes will be more
    interesting.

But now it is easy to see the way out of the argument for the proponent
of the centred world view. The crucial thing about Watson isn't, such a
theorist will say, that he's in another possible world. The crucial
thing is that some propositions that are false relative to us (e.g. the
proposition that private detectives were better at solving murder
mysteries than police) are true relative to him. The true generalisation
seems to be that S Vs that p, where V is factive, presupposes that p is
true relative to S. And that's true in the cases that von Fintel and
Gillies describe. So it's not true that the centred world theorist
should predict that these utterances have false presuppositions. And
that's all to the good, because of course they don't.

### Glanzberg on Metasemantics

Papers arguing for relativism about some term *t* frequently, perhaps
typically, start with a survey of reasons why (orthodox) contextualism
about *t* cannot be correct. And such a survey will frequently include a
sojourn through some quite specific contextualist theories, with some
fairly obvious counterexamples. @Egan2005-EGAEMI sticks to the script as
far as this goes. We note that *a* *might be F* can't, for instance,
mean that *For all S knows, a is F*, where *S* is the speaker. And we
note that some other simple theories along the same lines can't be true.

It's interesting to think through what kind of force such tours through
the possible contextualist theories could have. We might think that
there's a tacit argument that if some contextualist theory were true, it
would be one of these simple ones, and none of the simple ones is true,
so no contextualist theory is true. I'm not going to take a stand on
exegetical debates here, so I'm not going to consider who may or may not
have been making such an argument. I don't think that it was the
intended argument in @Egan2005-EGAEMI, but that's beside the point,
because it is an argument that's now being debated. The argument under
consideration isn't, or at least isn't directly, that the
contextualist's *semantic* proposal is mistaken. Rather, the argument is
that the accompanying *metasemantic* theory, i.e. the theory of how
semantic values get fixed, is intolerably complicated. Slightly more
formally, we can argue as follows.

1.  If contextualism is true, the metasemantic theory of how a
    particular use of "might" gets its semantic value is hideously
    complicated.

2.  Metasemantic theories about how context-sensitive terms get their
    values on particular occasions are never hideously complicated.

3.  So, contextualism is false.

The problem with this argument, as @Glanzberg2007 has argued, is that
premise 2 seems to be false. If we just look at some so-called
'automatic' indexicals, like "I" or "here" or "now", it just may be
plausible. (But even in those cases things are tricky when we look at
recordings, as in @Weatherson2002-WEAMI.) Once we widen our gaze though,
we see that there are examples of uncontroversially context-sensitive
terms, like "that", for which the accompanying metasemantic theory is,
by any standard, hideously complicated. So the prospects of getting to
relativism from metasemantic complexity are not, I think, promising.

That isn't the only kind of metasemantic argument for relativism though.
A better argument for relativism turns on the fact that metasemantics
*is* generally complicated. The contextualist, I think, has to make
metasemantics too systematic at a key point. (Again, I'm not doing
exegesis, but I do think something like this argument was intended in
Egan et al (2005). I'm largely here highlighting something that I think
has been thus far overlooked in the commentaries on that piece.)
Consider the following pair of sentences.

9.  Those guys are in trouble, but they don't know that they are.

10. ??Those guys are in trouble, but they might not be.

Something has gone wrong in (10). I conclude that (10) can't be used to
express (9). That is, there's no good interpretation of (10) where those
guys can be the denotation of *X* in the theory I attributed to Strawman
in the previous last section. That's to say, the value of *X* can't just
be the most salient individual(s) in the context, since the guys are
being made rather salient. And nor can it be anaphoric on previously
mentioned people, unless they are the subjects of a propositional
attitude ascription. We'll investigate this exception in what follows.

A natural move at this stage is to adopt what in @Egan2005-EGAEMI we
called the *Speaker Inclusion Constraint* (hereafter SIC). That is, in
unembedded uses of "might" the group *X* always includes the speaker.
Now the explanation of the problem with (10) is that for the speaker to
assert the first clause, she must know that the guys are in trouble, but
if that's the case, and she's in group *X*, then the second clause is
false.

If the SIC really holds, it looks like it should hold in virtue of the
meaning (in some sense of "meaning") of "might". As a rule, tidy
generalisations like this should be part of semantics, not
metasemantics. Compare two possible theories about "we". Both theories
say that "we" is a plural pronoun. One theory goes on to say that it is
part of the meaning of "we" that it picks out a group that includes the
speaker. That is, it puts this version of the SIC into the semantics.
Another theory says that the SIC for "we" is just a nice metasemantic
generalisation. I take it that the second position is very unattractive;
it's part of the meaning of "we" that it picks out a group including the
speaker. And I think the relevant point generalises. At least it
generalises as far as another SIC, namely the one that holds for
"might".

Semantic constraints on indexical terms hold, as a rule, for both
embedded and unembedded uses of those indexicals. You can't use "she",
even as a bound variable, to denote (relative to any variable
assignment) a male human. There's something badly wrong with *Every
student thinks she will win*, if some students are female and others
male. As Michael Glanzberg pointed out to me, complex demonstratives
headed by "this" have to pick out an object that is in some way
proximal, and this applies to bound complex demonstratives as well. So
we have to use "that" rather than "this" in sentences like *Every
connoisseur remembers that/\*this first great wine they drank*. For a
more familiar example, you can't interpret *O'Leary thinks that I am a
fool*, as uttered by Daniels, to mean that O'Leary self-ascribes
foolishness. In short, it seems that there are three related conclusions
we can draw here. First, there are semantic constraints on the possible
values of context-sensitive expressions. Second, any interesting
generalisation about the possible value of a context-sensitive
expression is traceable to such a semantic constraint. Third, these
constraints remain in force when the expression is used in an attitude
report, or as a bound variable.

The problem for contextualists about "might" is that it doesn't behave
at all this way. The SIC holds for unembedded uses. That implies that it
is part of the meaning of "might". So it should hold for embedded uses.
But it does not. Indeed, for many embedded uses of "might", a reading
compatible with the SIC is simply unavailable. For instance, we can't
interpret *Every student thinks that they might have failed* as meaning
that every student thinks that, for all I know, they failed. My
knowledge just doesn't matter; we're talking about those students'
fears. This all suggests the following argument.

1.  If contextualism is true, then the explanation of the SIC is that it
    is part of the meaning of "might" that the relevant group X includes
    the speaker.

2.  If it is part of the meaning of "might" that the relevant group X
    includes the speaker, then this must be true for all uses of
    "might", included embedded uses.

3.  When "might" is used inside the scope of an attitude ascription, the
    relevant group need not include the speaker.

4.  So, contextualism is not true.

Glanzberg argued, correctly, that it's no problem for the contextualist
if, according to their theory, metasemantics was complicated and messy.
It's not a problem because, well, metasemantics is complicated and
messy. But this cuts both ways. And it is a problem for the
contextualist that they have to put the SIC into metasemantics. It's
just not messy enough to go there.

There are two objections to this argument (both of which were pressed
when this paper was presented at Arché) that are worth considering
together.

> *Objection One: There are other generalisations that do go into
> metasemantics*
>
> It's very odd, to say the least, to use third-person pronouns to

The simplest response to the first objection is that the purported
generalisation, a third-person pronoun does not denote the speaker,
isn't really a universal generalisation at all. It's possible to refer
to oneself by name; certain people in the news do it on a regular basis.
For example, a famous footballer Smith might say "Smith deserves a pay
raise". In such a context, it isn't at all odd (or at least any odder
than it already is) to use third-person pronouns, e.g. by continuing the
above utterance with "and if he doesn't get one, he's not going to
play".

The second objection is a little trickier, but I think it's possible to
understand these utterances as a kind of projection. The speaker is
speaking from the perspective of the hearer. This isn't an unattested
phenomenon. Something like it must be going on when speakers use "we" to
denote the hearer. Imagine, for instance, a policeman coming across a
person staggering out of a pub and saying "We've had a bit much to drink
it seems". The policeman certainly isn't confessing to dereliction of
duty. Nor is this case sufficient to throw out the idea that "we" is a
*first person* plural pronoun. Rather, the policeman is speaking from
the drunk's perspective. I suspect the same thing is going on in both of
the examples above.

So I think both objections can be answered. But neither answer is
completely convincing. And the two responses undermine each other. If we
accept projection is a widespread phenomenon, then perhaps
self-denotation with a third person pronoun is a kind of projection. We
should then restate the argument, without assuming there's a response to
this pair of objections.

To do so, let's step back from the details of the SIC. What we started
with was a simple fact, that (10) can't be used to express (9). That's
not threatened by counterexamples to the SIC, and it still needs
explanation. The SIC is a proposed semantic explanation, and perhaps, if
it has counterexamples, it fails. I suspect something like it is
correct, but I don't plan to rely on that suspicion here. That's because
we can be independently confident that the explanation here will be
semantic, not pragmatic. We can be confident of this because there just
doesn't look to be anything like a pragmatic explanation available.

Compare the discussion of third-person pronouns. Even if we can't use
third-person pronouns to pick out ourselves (when not speaking
projectively), there is an obvious pragmatic explanation for this. We
have first-person pronouns available, and if we mean to denote
ourselves, using a first-person pronoun will do so in the clearest
possible way. Since it is good to be clear, when we pass up the chance
to use a first-person pronoun, the obvious conclusion for a hearer to
draw is that we don't mean to denote ourselves. The details of this
explanation could use some filling out, but it at least has the form of
an explanation. It simply doesn't seem that any such explanation will be
available for why (10) can't be used to express (9). It's not that (9)
isn't a thought that we might be interested in expressing. And it's not
that if we wanted to express it, we would have had an obviously
preferable form of words to (10). It's true that we have the words in
(9) itself, but (a) they are longer, and (b) on the contextualist view
whenever we use an epistemic modal there is some such paraphrase
available, a paraphrase that typically does not defeat the acceptability
of epistemic modals.

If there isn't a pragmatic explanation of why (10) can't be used to
express (9), then there must be a semantic explanation. But the only
semantic explanation that looks plausible from a contextualist
perspective, is a semantic restriction on *X*. And we know, from
considering the data about embedded epistemic modals, that there is no
such restriction. So we have a problem for contextualism. Slightly more
formally, we can offer the following argument against orthodox
contextualism about epistemic modals.

1.  Whatever acceptability data can't be explained pragmatically must be
    explained semantically.

2.  There is no pragmatic explanation for why (10) can't be used to
    express (9).

3.  If 1 and 2 then the meaning of "might" must explain why (10) can't
    be used to express (9).

4.  If the meaning of "might" must explain why (10) can't be used to
    express (9), and contextualism is true, there must be a restriction,
    provided by the meaning of "might" on the relevant group *X* that
    excludes groups like those guys.

5.  If there is a restriction, provided by the meaning of "might" on the
    relevant group *X* that excludes groups like those guys, then when
    "might" is embedded under an attitude verb, the group *X* still
    can't be those guys.

6.  In "Those guys believe that they might be in trouble", the relevant
    group *X* just is those guys.

7.  So, contextualism is false.

This argument is just an argument against contextualism about "might".
It doesn't obviously generalise very far. It's crucial to the argument
that (10) can't be used to express (9), even when the relevant guys are
made pretty salient. A similar argument against contextualism about,
say, taste claims, would have to start with the premise that a clause
like "but it's tasty", at the end of a sentence about *a*, couldn't be
used to express the thought that it is tasty to *a*. And such a premise
wouldn't be true. As Tamina @Stephenson2007 points out, make a
particular dog salient and "It's tasty" can express the thought that it
is tasty to the dog. So I'm rather sceptical that the considerations
here generalise to an argument against contextualism about predicates of
personal taste.

### Against Moral Relativism

At first glance there seems to be very little pattern to the way that
contextually sensitive terms behave in attitude ascriptions. We can find
terms, like we, whose denotation inside a belief ascription is not
particularly sensitive to the context of the ascribee. So in (11), we is
naturally interpreted as denoting the speaker and those around her.

1.  Otto believes that we are fools.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Vinny the Vulture believes that rotting carcasses are tasty.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Suzy believes that this kind of dog food is tasty.

On the other hand, when we use epistemic modals in belief reports, the
relevant 'knower' is always the ascribee. Consider, for example, (14).

1.  Jack believes that Smith might be happy.

So we have a progression of cases, where in (11) the contextually
sensitive term 'we' has to get its denotation from the context of
utterance, in (14) the contextually sensitive term 'might' gets its
denotation from the context of the ascribee, and (12) and (13) show that
'tasty' can behave in either of these ways. I've been putting this all
in terms that will make most sense if we are accepting truth absolutism,
but the same points can be made without that assumption if we so desire.

As I said, at first it might look like there is no pattern here at all.
But if we look at other attitudes, we see that there is an interesting
pattern. The way that 'we', 'tasty' and 'might' behave in belief reports
is just the same as they behave in knowledge reports. We can see this in
the following examples.

1.  Otto knows that we are fools.

2.  Vinny the Vulture knows that rotting carcasses are tasty.

3.  Suzy knows that this dog food is tasty.

4.  Jack knows that Smith might be happy.

*t* behaved quite differently in belief and knowledge reports. If that
were the case it would be possible in principle to find a passage of the
form of (15) that's true.

1.  S believes that ... t .... Indeed S knows it. But S doesn't know
    that ... t ... .

The problem for contextualism about "wrong" is that it is forced to
violate this principle. Assume that X is wrong means that X is wrong
relative to the standards of some salient group G. We'll leave aside for
now the question of whether G is determined by the speaker's context or
the assessor's context, as well as the question of whether the sentence
expresses a proposition involving G, or a proposition that is true or
false relative to groups. We'll also leave aside the question of just
what it means for something to be wrong relative to the standards. (Does
it mean that G actually disapproves of it, or would disapprove of it
under reflection, or that it doesn't have properties that G wants to
promote, or something else?) We'll simply assume that there have been
people whose standards are different to ours in ways that make a
difference for the wrongness of actions. If that isn't the case, we
hardly have a relativism worthy of the name. It's obviously
controversial just what could be an example of this, but I'll take as my
example Jefferson Davis's belief that helping fugitive slaves was wrong.
It seems true to say Davis had this belief, so (16) is true.

1.  Davis believed that helping fugitive slaves was wrong.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Davis knew that helping fugitive slaves was wrong.

Now neither the truth of (16), nor the falsity of (17) is, on its own,
sufficient to undermine contextualism about "wrong". The truth of (16)
is consistent with the claim that "wrong" behaves like "might". So in
attitude ascriptions, what matters is the ascribees context. And the
falsity of (17) is consistent with the claim that "wrong" behaves like
"we", and (17) is false because what helping fugitive slaves was wrong
expresses in our context is false.

Rather, the problem is that an adequate account of "wrong" has to
account both for the truth of (16) and the falsity of (17). And that
doesn't seem to be possible. At least it isn't possible without
supposing that "wrong" behaves differently in knowledge reports and
belief reports. And we've seen some reasons above to believe that that's
not how context-sensitive terms behave, whether the term is one like
"we", for which an orthodox theory seems best, or like "might", for
which a heterodox theory seems best.

I'll end with some objections that I've encountered since I've started
discussing this argument, with my replies to each of them.

> *Objection: This is question-begging against the moral relativist*.

This is the most common reaction I've heard, but I do find it hard to
make sense of. It is hard to see just which premise is question-begging.
Nothing in moral relativism as such prevents us accepting the truth of
*Davis believed that helping fugitive slaves was wrong*, and nothing in
moral relativism prevents us from rejecting *Davis knew that helping
fugitive slaves was wrong*. There is, I say, a problem with doing both
of these things, as we should want to do. But if an argument is going to
be rejected as question-begging because the other side can't
simultaneously accept *all* of its premises, well we won't have many
arguments left to work with.

A little more seriously, the relativist theories that I'm opposing here
are semantic theories. If we can't reject them because they commit us to
endorsing sentences that we (the opponents of the view) can see to be
false, then it is hard to know what could count as an argument in
semantics. It's no defence of a view to say that its proponents cannot
see it is false, if the rest of us can see it.

> *Objection: We would see the knowledge claim (17) is true, if only we
> didn't have anti-relativist prejudices*.

This might well be right; it's certainly hard to know when one is
prejudice free. Perhaps all that's going on is that we don't want to be
committed in any way to saying that it's wrong to help fugitive slaves,
and we're worried that accepting (17) would, in some way, so commit us.

But note how much I've done to stack the deck in favour of
pro-relativist intuitions, and to dissipate this worry. The argument is
coming at the end of a whole paper defending relativism. Earlier in this
very paper I defended some relativist views from arguments using factive
attitude verbs by noting that it is tricky to state just what factivity
comes to. In particular, I noted that we can sometimes say *A knows that
S* in circumstances where we would not, indeed could not truthfully,
utter *S*. And I repeated this observation at the start of this section.
I think I've done as much as possible to (a) overcome anti-relativist
prejudice, and (b) frame the argument in such a way as to make it as
easy as possible to accept (17). But even in this frame, I still say we
can see that it is false.

There's a really interesting philosophical position around here. Start
with the idea that we should be invariantists, perhaps realists in some
quite strong sense, about moral comparatives. Perhaps this could be tied
to the fairly intuitive idea that comparatives are what's crucial to
morality. Then say that terms like "right" and "wrong" pick out, in a
context-sensitive way, points on the moral scale. So some kind of
contextualism, presumably orthodox, is right for those terms. This
position is immune to the objection given above, because (16) turns out
to be true, and (17) false, if we interpret "wrong" to mean *above the
actually contextually-salient level of wrongness, on the objectively
correct wrongness scale*.

But I think a similar pair of examples show that this won't work. Assume
that we're talking about various people's charitable giving in a context
where we don't hold people to super-high standards. So the charitable
actions of, say, Bill Gates count as laudable in our circumstances. (I
assume that on the merits Gates's donations are for the good;
determining whether this is true is well outside the scope of this
paper.) Now consider a philosopher, call him Peter, who doesn't believe
in the moral supererogatory, so he thinks anything less than the best
you can do is morally wrong. It seems to me that, as uttered in our
context, (18) expresses a truth and (19) a falsehood.

1.  Peter believes that Bill Gates's level of charitable donation is
    wrong.

2.  Peter knows that Bill Gates's level of charitable donation is wrong.

And I don't think there's a good contextualist explanation for this pair
of judgments. If "wrong" was just a simple context-sensitive term in the
way suggested, then (18) should be false, because Peter doesn't believe
that Bill Gates's level of charitable donations do rise to the level of
wrongness that is, as it happens, is salient in our context. But
intuitively, (18) is true.

The same kind of objection can be raised to a more prominent kind of
theory that takes a certain kind of normative standard to be set by
context, namely classical contextualism about "knows". Assume it is
common ground that George has excellent, but not irrefutable, evidence
that he has hands. Assume also that we're in a low standards context for
knowledge. And assume that René thinks knowledge requires objective
certainty. Then it seems that we can truly say (20), but not (21).

1.  René believes that George doesn't know he has hands.

2.  René knows that George doesn't know he has hands.

Again, the pattern here is very hard to explain on any kind of
contextualist theory, be it orthodox or heterodox

> *Objection: Normative terms might be sui generis. Perhaps they are the
> only counterexamples to the pattern in (15)*.

Anything could be the exception to any rule we like. But it's bad
practice to assume that we have an exception on our hands. If we
heterodox theorists simply responded to von Fintel and Gillies' argument
from factive verbs by saying that we had an exception to a general
pattern here, we would, quite rightly, not be taken seriously.
Contextualists and relativists about normative terms should be held to
the same standard.

> *Objection: Relativism does have counterintuitive consequences, but
> all theories have some counterintuitive consequences. Arguably
> everyone is going to have to accept some kind of error theory, and
> this is a relatively harmless kind of error to attribute to the folk*.

If we were convinced, perhaps by one or other of the contemporary
developments of Mackie's argument from queerness [@Mackie1977], that no
non-relativistic moral theory is possible (apart from a Mackie-style
moral error theory), that would be an interesting argument for moral
relativism. Certainly I'd be more willing to accept that (16) and (17)
don't have the same kind of context-sensitivity than I would be to
accept that, say, it's not wrong to torture babies.

It is well beyond the scope of this paper to adjudicate such debates in
any detail, but I am a little sceptical that we will ever face such a
choice. Generalising wildly, most of the time our choice is between (a)
accepting a moral error theory, (b) accepting some odd semantic
consequences, as outlined here, or (c) rejecting some somewhat plausible
claim about the nature of moral judgment, such as motivational
internalism. (Without internalism there's nothing to make moral
properties "queer" in Mackie's sense, for example.) Arguments that
present a trilemma such as this deserve to be judged on their merits,
but my feeling is that we should normally take option (c). That's not to
say this objection is obviously flawed, or that the argument I've
offered is a knock-down refutation of relativism. It clearly is not. But
I think it is a challenge that moral relativists and contextualists
should face up to.
