# Introduction

Your article content goes here. You can write in Markdown and it will be converted to the appropriate LaTeX.

## Subsection

More content here.

### Subsubsection

Even more content.

## Cases with Description Lists

You can use Pandoc's definition list syntax, which will be converted to `ergodescription` environments:

Trolley
:   This is the trolley case description. It will be formatted with the ergodescription environment.

Case 1
:   This is another case with its description.

Or you can use titled descriptions by adding `{.ergodescription title="Cases Can Be Titled"}` after the list:

Trolley
:   This is the trolley case description.

Case 2
:   Another case description.

{.ergodescription title="My Custom Title"}
