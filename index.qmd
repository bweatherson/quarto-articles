I’m the Marshall M. Weinberg Professor of Philosophy at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

My dissertation (Monash, 1998) was called _On Uncertainty_, and it discussed formal models for reasoning under uncertainty. I have published three books:

  - [Oxford University Press site](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/normative-externalism-9780199696536)
  - [Version submitted for publication](ne/index.html)
- A History of Philosophy Journals: Volume 1 Evidence from Topic Modeling, 1876-2013 (Maize Press, 2022)
  - [Maize Press site](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/2v23vw98g)
  - [Version submitted for publication](https://lda.weatherson.org)
- Knowledge: A Human Interest Story (Open Book Publishers, 2024)
  - [Open Book site](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0425)
  - [Version submitted for publication](kahis/index.html)

I have published over 70 papers over the years, and drafts of all of these papers are available here.

- [All papers](papers.html)
- [Epistemology papers](epist.html)
- [Decision theory papers](gdt.html)

The links will take you to versions of the papers that can be read in the browser. There is a link in the sidebar of each paper to a traditional PDF. There are links to the published versions of each paper on my [CV](cv.html).

I am an editor of [Philosophers’ Imprint](https://www.philosophersimprint.org/).
