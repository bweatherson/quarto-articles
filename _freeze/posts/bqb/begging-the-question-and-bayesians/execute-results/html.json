I argue that the same criticism can be levelled at Maher's own argument for Bayesianism.\ndate: April 1 2001\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"0.1016/S0039-3681(99)00020-5\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - games and decisions\n  - notes\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1111/0.1016/S0039-3681(99)00020-5\njournal:\n    title: \"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A\"\n    publisher: \"Science Direct\"\nvolume: 30\nnumber: 4\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: begging.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\nThe arguments for Bayesianism in the literature fall into three broad\ncategories. There are Dutch Book arguments, both of the traditional\npragmatic variety and the modern 'depragmatised' form. And there are\narguments from the so-called 'representation theorems'. The arguments\nhave many similarities, for example they have a common conclusion, and\nthey all derive epistemic constraints from considerations about coherent\npreferences, but they have enough differences to produce hostilities\nbetween their proponents. In a recent paper, @Maher1997 has argued that\nthe pragmatised Dutch Book arguments are unsound and the depragmatised\nDutch Book arguments question begging. He urges we instead use the\nrepresentation theorem argument as in @Maher1993. In this paper I argue\nthat Maher's own argument is question-begging, though in a more subtle\nand interesting way than his Dutch Book wielding opponents.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A* 30: 687-697.\n\nPicture by [ankakay](https://www.flickr.com/photos/56738296@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/de17378a-3148-4ae7-b101-a773da9674ef).\n</aside>\n\n### Bayesianism\n\nWhat's a Bayesian? The term these days covers so many different\npositions that the only safe course is to strictly define what one means\nby the term. The alternative, as the discussion in @Walley1996 shows, is\nto have one of the least interesting semantic debates ever held. I\ndefine a Bayesian to be one who is committed to two theses, which I'll\ncall (B1) and (B2).\n\n(B1)\n\n:   Belief comes by degrees.\n\n(B2)\n\n:   It is a requirement of consistency that these degrees of belief, or\n    credences, be consistent with the probability calculus.\n\nI should explain (B2) a little. Historically, Bayesians held that\ncredences were, or at least ought be, reals in [0, 1], and the\nfunction *Bel* which takes any proposition into the agent's credence in\nthat proposition should be a probability function. Modern Bayesians,\nfollowing @Levi1980 and @Jeffrey1983, allow that credences can be\nimprecise. In this case the consistency requirement is that there be\nsome precisification of their credences which is a probability function.\n(B2) is deliberately ambiguous between the traditional and modern\nBayesian positions, largely because nothing in this debate turns on this\nquestion[^1].\n\nThere are many other properties that could have been used to define\nBayesians. For example, it could be suggested that it is requirement of\nbeing a Bayesian that one think rules like (B2) are derived by analysing\ncredences as dispositions to bet. This is suggested by @Kaplan1993 [320]\nto be the \"fundamental Bayesian insight\". Or it could be argued that\nbeing a Bayesian requires some an extra rule to the effect that\ncredences are updated by conditionalisation. I haven't included that for\ntwo reasons. First, I'm mostly interested in static constraints on\ncredences, and secondly, some paradigm Bayesians like @Levi1980 and\n@vanFraassen1989 reject this rule in its fully general form. Finally it\nmight be suggested that Bayesians aren't those that believe certain\nprinciples like (B1) and (B2), but only those who think these principles\nprovide the foundation for all philosophy of science. So perhaps my\ndefinition is a bit liberal.\n\nNow it is well known that not everyone's a Bayesian. One group of\nnon-Bayesians who have received too little attention from their Bayesian\nrivals are those who accept (B1) but not (B2). That is, theorists who\nagree there are such things as credences, and even that credences are\nimportant for philosophy of science, but not that they ought be\nconstrained by the probability calculus. The most interesting example is\nthe theory of evidence developed by @Dempster1967 [@Dempster1968] and\n@Shafer1976\n\nDempster and Shafer, like many other theorists, think that when we have\nno evidence either for or against *p*, we should have low credences in\nboth *p* and ${\\lnot}$*p*. In the limit case it is acceptable to have\nour credence in both *p* and in ${\\lnot}$*p* set at zero. Now this is in\nconflict with (B2), for it is a theorem of the probability calculus that\n*Pr*(*p*) + *Pr*(${\\lnot}$*p*) = 1, and so by (B2) it is a requirement\nof rationality that *Bel*(*p*) + *Bel*(${\\lnot}$*p*) = 0.\n\nThis intuition about cases where the evidence is low is formalised in a\nrather neat theory. For simplicity I'll say how the theory works when we\nare interested in finitely many propositions; Shafer shows the infinite\ncase can be dealt with but it doesn't raise any philosophically\ninteresting differences. We are interested in *n* propositions, so the\npossibility space contains 2*^n^* 'worlds'. A proposition *A* can be\nidentified in the usual ways with the set of worlds at which it is true.\nThe Bayesian has us place a normalised measure on this possibility\nspace, with our credence in *A* being the measure of the set *A*. In\nDempster and Shafer's theory we place a normalised measure, which they\ncall a 'mass function' on the power set of the worlds, excluding the\nnull set. Our credence in *A* is calculated as the measure of the set of\nsets which are subsets of *A*. So in the simplest case, where we are\njust interested in one proposition *p*, the mass function is defined on\n{{*p*}, {${\\lnot}$*p*}, {*p*, ${\\lnot}$*p*}}. Complete ignorance is\nrepresented by giving {*p*, ${\\lnot}$*p*} mass one, and the other sets\nmass zero. Hence both *Bel*(*p*) and *Bel*(${\\lnot}$*p*) are zero. On\nthe other hand, *Bel*(*p* ${\\vee}$ ${\\lnot}$*p*) will be one, as is\n*Bel*(*C*) for any classical tautology *C*. As a consequence of this we\nwill not have the addition rule.\n\n*Addition*:\n\n:   For disjoint *A*, *B*,\n    *Bel*(*A* ${\\vee}$ *B*) = *Bel*(*A*) + *Bel*(*B*)\n\nSince Bayesians believe in *Addition* and some opponents do not,\narguments for Bayesianism should be *inter alia* arguments for\n*Addition*. I don't want to argue that Dempster and Shafer's theory is\nright. It has some internal problems, particularly with updating, which\nmake it look not too promising as a general theory of evidence. The\nrecent collection edited by @Yager1994 has papers dealing with many of\nthese issues for the interested reader. My interest in this theory is\nmerely to show the kind of theorist the Bayesian must argue against.\nThis is particularly important when the alleged problem with arguments\nfor Bayesianism is that they are question-begging.\n\nAs a last point about the Dempster-Shafer theory it might be noted that\nnot only does *Addition* fail for credences, the equivalent rule for\nvaluing bets also fails. Put formally, let an *A*-bet be a bet which\npays £1 if *A* and nothing otherwise. It is consistent with the\nDempster-Shafer theory to say the value of an *A*-bet is always\n£*Bel*(*A*). So on this theory it is not the case that for disjoint *A*,\n*B* it is true that the value of an (*A* ${\\vee}$ *B*)-bet always equals\nthe value of an *A*-bet plus the value of a *B*-bet.\n\nSince it is sometimes thought there is an argument showing this to be\nincoherent, it is worthwhile giving a partial defence of its\nconsistency. An argument like the following appears, as we'll see, to be\nendorsed by Maher. There exists a voucher which is an\n(*A* ${\\vee}$ *B*)-bet, a ticket which is an *A*-bet and a coupon which\nis a *B*-bet. Now anyone holding the ticket and the coupon will receive\nexactly the same payout in all circumstances as anyone holding the\nvoucher, hence they must have the same value. Hence the value of the\nvoucher is the value of the ticket plus the value of the coupon. The\nproblem with this argument is that it assumes the ticket and the coupon\nare not what economists call complementary goods. Some goods, like say\ncompact discs, have more value to a consumer if they hold certain other\ngoods, like compact disc players. On the Dempster-Shafer theory, the\nticket and the coupon may well be complementary goods. To anyone holding\nthe ticket, the value of the coupon is the difference between value of\nthe voucher and the value of the ticket, that is,\n*Bel*(*A* ${\\vee}$ *B*) - *Bel*(*A*). This will in general be greater\nthan its 'intrinsic' value *Bel*(*B*). But this goes no way to showing\nthat its value to someone without the ticket must be greater than\n*Bel*(*B*). This, in rough outline, is the objection @Schick1986 makes\nto Dutch Book arguments. So arguments for *Addition* which assume that\n*A*-bets and *B*-bets are not complements will beg the question against\nproponents of the Dempster-Shafer theory, who have a principled reason\nto reject that assumption.\n\n### Dutch Book Arguments\n\nAs I mentioned above, there are three broad categories of arguments for\nBayesianism, two breeds of Dutch Book arguments and 'representation\ntheorem' style arguments. In this section I'll briefly deal with the\nDutch Book arguments before looking at Maher's version of the\nrepresentation theorem argument in section 3.\n\nThe classic, pragmatic, Dutch Book argument, assumes that appropriate\ncircumstances exist whereby the amount an agent would be prepared to pay\nfor any *A*-bet is £*Bel*(*A*). Indeed, they assume this not only is\ntrue, but that it would remain true while the agent starts trading in\nbets. Given these assumptions, if the agent's credences are not a\nprobability function, a clever bookie who knows just their credences can\nsell them a 'Dutch Book' which is guaranteed to lose in all\ncircumstances.\n\nEveryone's got their favourite objection to this argument, so I won't\nspend much time on it here. @Maher1993 [98] argues that the declining\nmarginal utility of money means that this won't work for pounds, and\nsince there is no currency with a constant marginal utility this flaw\ncan't be resolved. This is a rather odd objection since @Savage1954\nargued long ago that we could get around this problem by using bets\ndenominated in lottery tickets. As mentioned above, @Schick1986 takes\nthe possibility of complementary bets to be a crushing blow to the\nargument. My favourite objection turns on the distinction that Adam\nSmith famously drew attention to between the usefulness of a good and\nits market value. *Bel*(*A*) can determine, at most, the usefulness of\nan *A*-bet, so at disequilibrium a coherent agent should probably *not*\ntrade *A*-bets for £*Bel*(*A*). And since there's Dutch Books to be sold\nwe must be at disequilibrium, so the initial assumption about\n'appropriate circumstances' must be false. In any case, there are enough\ndifferent objections to this argument that we can safely move on.\n\nThe depragmatised Dutch Book arguments, as in @HowsonUrbach1989,\n@Christensen1996 and @Hellman1997, do away with the prospect of a bookie\nactually milking the poor incoherent agent. Rather they use similar\nreasoning to show that there is something wrong with an agent whose\ncredences are not probability functions. I will concentrate on\nChristensen's argument, but similar comments apply to the other two\narguments.\n\nChristensen does not believe that an agent who's credence in *A* is *x*\nshould be prepared to buy a *A*-bet for £*A*. However he does say that\nthe agent should \"evaluate such [trades] as fair\" [@Christensen1996\n456]. So credences may 'sanction' (his term) certain odds even if the\nagent does not desire to accept these sanctioned bets. This may come\nabout because of the declining marginal utility of the currency in which\nthe bets are denominated, or because of a dislike of gambling, or\npossibly because of the discrepancy I mentioned between use-value and\nexchange-value. Now making the safe enough assumption that credences\nthat sanction trades which lead to sure loss are defective he concludes\nthat credences which do not satisfy the probability calculus are\ndefective.\n\nHowever, @Maher1997 [301-3] points out, the argument so far doesn't get\nthe conclusion Christensen wants. Indeed for some simple Shafer\nfunctions which are not probability functions no sure-loss trades will\nbe sanctioned. To get Christensen's conclusion, we need the extra\npremise that if two trades are sanctioned their sum is sanctioned.\nEquivalently, we need the premise that what bets are sanctioned is\nindependent of what bets are already held. But given the definition of\n'sanction' this just is the premise that credences must satisfy\n*Addition*. So the argument is question-begging against the writer who\ndenies *Addition*. Maher shows that similar problems beset the arguments\nin @HowsonUrbach1989 and @Hellman1997.\n\n### Representation Theorems\n\nThe alternative Maher supports is based around 'representation\ntheorems'. A similar approach is taken by @Kaplan1996, but I'll focus on\nMaher. In any case, the issues that arise are exactly the same. The\nbasic idea is that it is a requirement on the coherence of an agent's\npreferences that there exist a probability function and a set of utility\nfunctions equivalent up to affine transformation such that the agent\nprefers gamble *f* to *g* iff the expected utility of *f* given the\nprobability function and any of the utility functions is greater than\nthat of *g*. The probability function will give us the agent's credences\nin all propositions. Preferences are decreed to be coherent if they\nsatisfy a number of axioms that Maher defends. For example, it is\nrequired that preferences be transitive, that an agent not prefer *f* to\n*g* and prefer *g* to *f*, and so on. The claim here is that the defence\nof these axioms begs the question against a supported of the\nDempster-Shafer approach.\n\nStrictly Maher does not quite believe that all coherent credence\nfunctions are probability functions. The argument to that conclusion\nrequires that preferences be complete, and Maher does not think this is\nplausible. If we drop that assumption we get the conclusion that the\nagent's credences should be represented by sets of probability functions\nas in Levi and Jeffrey, not a single probability function. However for\nconvenience he assumes first that completeness holds, and I'll follow\nthis lead. Nothing pertaining to the success or otherwise of the\nargument turns on this point.\n\nThere are a few immediate problems with this approach. Maher needs to\nassume that if an agent has a higher credence in *p* than in *q* they\nwill prefer a *p*-bet to a *q*-bet. The problem is that when it is\nunlikely that we will ever see *p* or ${\\lnot}$*p* confirmed we may well\nprefer a *q*-bet to a *p*-bet even if we have a higher degree of belief\nin *p*. I would prefer a bet on the Yankees winning the next World\nSeries to a bet on Oswald being Kennedy's assassin, even though I have a\nhigher degree of belief in Oswald's guilt than the Yankees's success,\nbecause betting on the Yankees gives me *some* chance of getting a\npayout.\n\nMaher is aware of this point, but his attempt to dispose of it is\ndisastrous. His example is comparing a bet on the truth of the theory of\nevolution, construed as the claim that all life on earth is descended\nfrom a few species, with betting on its negation @Maher1993 [89]. Taking\nscientists as his expert function he asks some biologists which of these\nbets they would prefer, on the assumption that there are\nextraterrestrials who have been observing earth from its formation and\nwill adjudicate on the bet. He is rather happy that they all plump for\nbetting on Darwin. But this is a perfectly useless result. The objection\nwas that we can have degrees of belief on unverifiable propositions, but\nour attitudes to bets on these propositions will be quite different to\nour attitude towards bets on verifiable propositions. He has attempted\nto counter this by simply making the problematic proposition verifiable.\nWhen we drop the assumption that there are extraterrestrials, so the\ntheory of evolution would become unverifiable, presumably most people\nwould (strictly) prefer a bet on a fair coin landing heads to either a\nbet on the theory of evolution or its negation. Preferences in a\nsituation when the theory is verifiable are completely irrelevant to the\nproblem unverifiable theories pose for Bayesian philosophies of science.\nSo we have a problem, although I'd be prepared to accept for the sake of\nthe argument it can be finessed.\n\nThe major problem for Maher is that his argument is just as\nquestion-begging as the Dutch Book arguments he criticises, though in a\nmore subtle and interesting way. For Maher's argument to work we have to\naccept some constraints on preferences, such as transitivity. His\nargument is only as strong as the argument for these constraints. He has\nnine axioms which must be justified in some way[^2]. The most\ninteresting is Independence, which he construes as follows. **D** is a\nset of gambles and **X** a set of propositions, *f* ${\\leq}$ *g* means\nthe agent either prefers *g* to *f* or is indifferent between them,\n*f* ${\\equiv}$ *g* means that *f* and *g* are exactly the same gamble,\nthey have the same payouts in all possible worlds, and\n*f* ${\\equiv}$ *g* on *A* means that on all possible worlds in which\n*A*, *f* and *g* have the same payouts.\n\nIndependence\n\n:   For all *f*, *f*$^\\prime$, *g*, *g*$^\\prime$ ${\\in}$ **D** and\n    *A* ${\\in}$ **X**, if *f* ${\\equiv}$ *f* $^\\prime$ on *A*,\n    *g* ${\\equiv}$ *g*$^\\prime$ on *A*, *f* ${\\equiv}$ *g* on\n    ${\\lnot}$*A*, *f* $^\\prime$ ${\\equiv}$ *g*$^\\prime$ on ${\\lnot}$*A*\n    and *f* ${\\leq}$ *g* then *f* $^\\prime$ ${\\leq}$ *g*$^\\prime$\n    [@Maher1993 190]\n\nThe idea is that if *f* and *g* have the same payouts given some\nproposition, say *A*, our preference between *f* and *g* should be\nindependent of its value. All that matters, according to this idea, is\nthe comparative fact that if *A* turns out true *f* and *g* have\nidentical payouts, so whichever of the bets is preferred given\n${\\lnot}$*A* should be preferred overall. The most famous examples where\nintuition says this may be violated are the Allais and Ellsburg\n'paradoxes'. Since uncertainty plays a larger role in it, I'll briefly\nsketch the Ellsburg paradox. An urn contains 90 balls. Thirty of these\nare yellow, and remainder are either black or red in unknown proportion.\nThe payouts for the four gambles in question are given in this table.\n\n::: {.center}\n  -------------- ----- ------- --------\n                 Red   Black   Yellow\n  *f*            £1    0       0\n  *g*            0     0       £1\n  *f*$^\\prime$   £1    £1      0\n  *g*$^\\prime$   0     £1      £1\n  -------------- ----- ------- --------\n:::\n\nMany subjects prefer *g* to *f*, since they know the chance of a yellow\nball being drawn but not that of a red ball, but prefer *f*$^\\prime$ to\n*g*$^\\prime$ since they know the chance of a red or black ball being\ndrawn but not that of a black or yellow ball. This is easily justifiable\nunder the Dempster-Shafer approach. Let *B*, *R* and *Y* be the\npropositions that a black, red and yellow ball respectively is drawn.\nGiven the evidence about the composition of the urn, it seems plausible\nto set *Bel*(*B*) = *Bel*(*R*)=0, *Bel*(*Y*)=*Bel*(*Y*${\\vee}$*B*) =\n*Bel*(*Y*${\\vee}$*R*) = $\\frac{1}{3}$ and *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*) =\n$\\frac{2}{3}$. Bayesians say this is coherent, but it is perfectly\nacceptable under a Dempster-Shafer theory. Given these credences, the\nvalue of *f* is £0, and the value of *g* is £$\\frac{1}{3}$. However the\nvalue of *f*$^\\prime$ is £$\\frac{2}{3}$ while the value of *g*$^\\prime$\nis just £$\\frac{1}{3}$. Hence it is not only acceptable, but arguably a\nrequirement of rationality that an agent prefer *g* to *f* but\n*f*$^\\prime$ to *g*$^\\prime$.\n\nWith these preferences, and setting *A* to 'A black ball is not drawn'\nwe can see this violates Maher's independence axiom. No objection yet,\nmany people are just irrational. The real problem arises with Maher's\nargument that people who choose in this way are irrational. The\nfollowing two choice trees set out two 'tree form' versions of the\nchoices facing these subjects.\n\n![](begging-img1.png){width=\"300pt\"}\n\nThe left-hand tree represents the choice between *f* and *g*. The\nsubject is told that if a black ball is drawn they will receive nothing,\nbut if it is not drawn they will have a choice between betting on red\nand betting on yellow. So far we have a standard enough dynamic choice\nproblem. Maher proposes to make it synchronic by requiring that subjects\nspecify in advance what they would do if they reached the square, that\nis if a black ball is not drawn. This, he claims, makes the situation\nexactly as if the agent was choosing between *f* and *g*. Now the\nright-hand tree is the same as the left-hand tree in all respects but\none. If a black ball is drawn the agent receives £1, not nothing. But\nthe only choice the agent has to make is exactly the same as in the\nleft-hand tree, so they ought make the same choice. We can concede to\nMaher here that it would be irrational to specify, in advance, a\npreference for *g* over *f* in the left-hand tree and for *f*$^\\prime$\nover *g* in the right-hand tree. This is, however, insufficient for his\nconclusion.\n\nThe problem lies in his assumption that \"it seems uncontroversial that\nthe consequences a person values are not changed by representing the\noptions in a tabular or tree form\" @Maher1993 [71]. As @Seidenfeld1994\nmakes clear, this is exactly what is controversial in these\ncircumstances. Indeed this premise, call it Reduction, is expressly\ndenied by a number of heterodox decision theorists, and by writers who\ndeny *Addition* on the occasions they talk about decision theory. There\nis a good reason for this. As noted above, on the Dempster-Shafer\ntheory, *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*)may be greater than *Bel*(*B*)+*Bel*(*R*).\nWhen evaluating the worth of choosing *f*$^\\prime$ in the original,\ntabular, it seems plausible that it is *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*) that\nmatters, not *Bel*(*B*)+*Bel*(*R*). However in the tree form problem all\nthat matters to *f*$^\\prime$ is *Bel*(*B*), for the possibility that we\nwon't need to choose, and *Bel*(*R*), for the possibility that we do.\n\nThe point is that Maher has to either assume agents only consider\n*Bel*(*B*) and *Bel*(*R*) when assessing *f*$^\\prime$, not\n*Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*), or that *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*) is some function of\n*Bel*(*B*) and *Bel*(*R*) so that we can ignore that complication, in\nhis 'uncontroversial' assumption. The first option is implausible,\nsurely when comparing *f*$^\\prime$ and *g*$^\\prime$ we just compare\n*Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*) with *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*Y*). More interestingly, I\nclaim that the second is question-begging. Given that virtually everyone\nagrees that in some cases, for example lotteries, degrees of belief\nshould be probability functions, in some cases the function which gives\nus *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*) from *Bel*(*B*) and *Bel*(*R*) must be\naddition. Hence he must assume that *Bel*(*B*${\\vee}$*R*) =\n*Bel*(*B*)+*Bel*(*R*) for the move from tabular to tree form to be\nplausible. But this is just what he was trying to prove, so the argument\nis question-begging.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMaher rightly objects to depragmatised Dutch Book arguments on the\nground that they are question-begging. That is, they use their\nconclusion as an implicit premise. It is argued here that the same\nobjection applies to Maher's argument for Bayesianism. He relies on the\nreducibility of tree form decisions to table form decisions, but the\nonly justification for this could be a reliance on *Addition*. But\n*Addition* was what he was trying to prove all along, so he isn't\nallowed to take Reduction as a premise.\n\nThere are three moves that Maher could make here. First, he could say\nthat Reduction is so obvious that it should be acceptable as a premise\nwithout justification. The resulting argument may be effective at\nconvincing some agnostics about Bayesianism that their implicit\nassumptions all along were Bayesian, but it would be completely\nineffective against the sceptics about Bayesianism I have been\ndiscussing. Secondly, he could come up with a new argument for Reduction\nthat I haven't considered here and isn't vulnerable to this objection.\nGiven the conclusions of the last section I doubt this is possible, but\nthe ingenuity of philosophers shouldn't be underestimated. Thirdly, and\nmost interestingly, he could look for justifications of Bayesianism that\ndo not rely on construing credences as dispositions to bet. Since the\narguments from considerations about preferences to constraints on\ncredences have so far all failed, the time might be right to look at the\nproblem from a different direction.\n\n[^1]: Historically the impetus for allowing imprecise credences was the\n    economic distinction between insurable and uninsurable risks, as\n    discussed in @Knight1921, @Keynes1937, @Tintner1941 and @Hart1942.\n\n[^2]: There is a further axiom designed to guarantee countable\n    additivity, but that raises independent problems and won't be\n    discussed here.\n",
