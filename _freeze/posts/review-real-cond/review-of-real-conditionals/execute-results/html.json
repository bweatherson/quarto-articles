Lycan takes compositionality seriously, so in\nhis theory the meaning of 'even if', for example, should be a\ncombination of the meaning of 'even' and the meaning of 'if'. After\nreading his work, it's hard to take seriously work which does not share\nthis methodology.\n\nLycan's semantics for conditionals makes central use of what\nhe calls 'events'. An event is not a possible world, for it need not be\ncomplete or consistent. It is more like what Barwise and Perry call a\n'situation'. Conditionals are quantifiers over events, as follows:\n\n- P if Q = P in any event in which Q\n- P only if Q = P in no event other than one in which Q\n- P even if Q = P in any event including any in which Q (17)\n\n\nThe quantifiers here are contextually restricted. Lycan includes in the\nsemantic analysis a predicate of events *R*, whose role is to restrict\nthe quantifiers over events. An event satisfies *R* only if it is\n'envisaged', which is similar to saying it is a 'real' or 'relevant'\npossibility. The value of *R* changes frequently; sometimes it even\nchanges mid-sentence. This fact is appealed to frequently in explaining\nsome surprising behaviour of conditionals. For example, the invalidity\nof antecedent-strengthening: *if p then r*, *so if p and q then r*, is\nexplained by saying the class of events relevant to the truth of the\nconclusion may be larger than the class of events relevant to the truth\nof the premise. In particular, at least one event in which *p* *and\nq* is relevant to the conclusion, but no such event need be relevant to\nthe premise. A similar explanation is given for the failure of\ntransitivity and contraposition.\n\nThe quantifier domain must include some non-actual events or\nconditionals will turn into material implications. Surprisingly, Lycan\nsays that sometimes the quantifier includes only non-actual events. In\nthese cases, it is possible that all (relevant) *p*-events can\nbe *q*-events, even though *p* is true but not *q*. That is, in these\ncases modus ponens is invalid. Lycan argues persuasively that the case\nagainst modus ponens is at least as strong as the case against\nantecedent-strengthening, contraposition and modus tollens.\n\nThere is an extended discussion of 'even', which is\nnecessary for providing a theory of 'even if'. Lycan first suggests\nthat *Even Grannie was sober* means *Everyone, including Grannie*, *was\nsober*. The quantifier domain includes everyone no less likely than\nGrannie to be sober. After discussing some counterexamples, Lycan\nsuggests that instead it means *Everyone plus Grannie was sober*, where\nthe quantifer ranges over everyone whom you would expect to be sober.\nLycan is committed to 'even' being a quantifier because of its syntactic\nsimilarity to 'only', and because of the \"initial plausibility of ...\nuniversally quantified paraphrases\" (121) of sentences involving 'even'.\nThe discussion here is fascinating, but not conclusive. It isn't clear,\nfor example, that 'even' and 'only' have the same syntactic role.\nCompare *Even supposing Jack were here, he wouldn't help* with \\**Only\nsupposing Jack were here, he wouldn't help*.\n\nLycan also includes a helpful discussion of how his theory\nhandles Allan Gibbard's 'Riverboat Puzzle' and related cases. It is\ntroubling, for those who don't analyse conditionals as material\nimplications, that sometimes one speaker can say *If p, q*, another can\nsay *If p, not q*, and both seem to be speaking truly. Lycan argues we\nshould accept this troubling consequence, but explain it by\nmaking *R* sensitive to epistemic considerations.\n\nAs well as these points, Lycan raises some powerful\nobjections to 'No Truth Value' theories of conditionals, and against the\nextensive use of probability theory in semantics. The book concludes\nwith two appendicies on 'non-conditional' conditionals, such as *If\nyou're hungry, there's biscuits on the sideboard*.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this book, not least it's witty,\neven charming, style. Lycan considers more examples, from more diverse\nsources, than most writers. The theory he presents is innovative and at\nleast aims to be comprehensive. And of course there are some good\narguments for it. Despite this there are, as always, occasional grounds\nfor complaint.\n\nAlthough Lycan is very careful to get the syntax of 'if'\nright, and proves that unlike 'and' and 'or' it is not a co-ordinating\nconjunction, it is not so clear that the syntactic evidence provides\ndistinctive support for his semantic theory. If it's consistent with the\nsyntax to say *p if q* means *All relevant q-events are p-events*, it's\nconsistent with the syntax to say that it means *All nearby q-worlds are\np-worlds*. So the syntactic argument for preferring Lycan's theory, to,\nsay, Stalnaker's, is not obviously overpowering. Lycan suggests that we\ncan naturally paraphrase conditionals as quantifications over events,\nbut since he is using *event* 'in a slightly uncommon way' (17) it is\nnot obvious what support this gives for his theory.\n\nThere are few reasons to favour the use of events rather\nthan worlds in the analysis. The fact that events can be incomplete\nseems to only cause complications for the theory. The fact that they can\nbe inconsistent is used to rescue some intuitions about conditionals\nwith impossible antecedents, but many would argue those intuitions\nshould be discarded.\n\nBut the main worry is that Lycan needs to say more about\nsome key notions, particularly about his *R* and about validity. In the\ndiscussion of the Riverboat Puzzle, Lycan says, \"I do not have a good\nenough intuitive handle on my own notion of 'relevance' to provide a\ncrushing answer [to a question about why certain events are not covered\nby *R*].\" (173)  Lycan says that for an event to be *R*, \"the utterer\nmust have it at least tacitly in mind as a live prospect.\" (19) All\nevents in *R* are 'envisaged', to use the term he lands on. But \"there\nis somethig slightly artificial or stylized about 'envisaging' ...\n'Envisaging' is not a purely *de facto* cognitive or other psychological\nstate.\" (30) The upshot is that the envisaged possibilities are some,\nbut not always all, of those that are (possibly tacitly) regarded as\nlive. Just which possibilities then? We are never given a specific\naccount. Any account we do get is, as in the above quote, almost\nimmediately qualified. Since *R* does so much work, the reader is\nprobably owed a little more here. (This point is made at greater length\nin Ken Turner's excellent review of *Real Conditionals* in the *Journal\nof Pragmatics* forthcoming.)\n\nWe are also never specifically given an account of validity.\nWe are told that several argument forms, from antecedent-strengthening\nto modus ponens, are invalid. This seems to mean that one could assert\ntheir premises then reject, or a least decline to assert, their\nconclusion. It's important that this process of assertion and rejection\ntake place in real time, because the value of *R* needs to change for\nthe arguments to be invalid. Lycan has some arguments that this\nconception of validity is the philosophically interesting one, but this\ndeserves more treatment. The logical reforms it draws in go well beyond\nthe logic of conditionals. On Lycan's approach, *All swans are white, so\nall Australian swans are white* is, presumably, invalid, since the scope\nof the quantifier could change from premise to conclusion. And\ncontraposition fails for valid arguments. Contraposed modus ponens: *p,\nnot q, so not if p, q* is valid, but modus ponens is not.\n\nNone of this is to deny that *Real Conditionals* is a great\ncontribution to the literature, and if it causes more theorists to pay\nserious attention to Lycan's Event Theory, that would be an excellent\nconsequence.\n\n \n\n \n",
