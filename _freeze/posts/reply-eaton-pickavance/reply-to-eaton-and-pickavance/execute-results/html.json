They take this consequence to be so implausible that it refutes interest-relative invariantism. But in fact it is a consequence that any theory of knowledge that has the resources to explain familiar puzzles (such as Gettier cases) must have.\ndate: March 11 2016\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1007/s11098-016-0660-0\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - interest-relativity\n  - notes\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-016-0660-0\njournal:\n    title: \"Philosophical Studies\"\n    publisher: \"Springer\"\nvolume: 173\nnumber: 12\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: fire.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nDaniel Eaton and Timothy Pickavance note an interesting consequence of\nsome popular versions of interest-relative invariantism (IRI). They take\nthis consequence to be a *reductio* of (those versions of) IRI. I'll\nagree it is an interesting consequence, but argue that it cannot be a\n*reductio*. They take as a fixed point the following principle:\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophical Studies_ 173: 3231–3233.\n</aside>\n\n> We take it to be rather obvious that one ought not be able to go from\n> not knowing that $p$ to knowing that $p$ by getting evidence *against*\n> $p$, nor should one be able to go from knowing that $p$ to not knowing\n> that $p$ by getting evidence *for* $p$.  [@EatonPickavance2015 3142,\n> emphasis in original]\n\nThe interesting consequence they note is that some versions of IRI\nviolate this principle. It is possible, they argue, to come to know $p$\nsolely by getting evidence against it, at least on common versions of\nIRI.\n\nBut this is not a distinctive, or problematic, feature of IRI. It is\ntrue of any theory of knowledge that allows for Gettier cases.[^1]\nAssume that our protagonist *S* has evidence that makes *q* incredibly\nlikely, and on that basis the agent believes *q*. Assume further that\n*q* entails *p*, that *q* is false, and *p* is true. At least in typical\nsuch cases, *S* will not know that *p*.[^2] Now imagine that *S* gets\nnew evidence that makes *q* very unlikely, but makes *r*, which also\nentails *p*, likely enough. If *r* is true, then getting this new\nevidence could both decrease the evidential probability of *p*, and make\nit the case that *S* knows that *p*. The converse is possible too. If\nthe agent originally believes *p* on the basis of true *r*, then gets\nevidence that undermines *r*, but makes *p* more likely by making *q*,\nwhich is false and entails *p*, very likely, they will get evidence for\n*p*, and in virtue of that lose knowledge that *p*.\n\nThis point, that in Dharmottara/Gettier cases evidence can both create\nknowledge and be evidence against the proposition now known, is not\nnovel. Brian  [@Weatherson2014-ProbScept] discusses some such cases,\nattributing them to Martin Smith. Weatherson argues that any theory that\nallows for defeaters will have this consequence, since it will always be\npossible for evidence to defeat a defeater, while ever so slightly\nlowering the evidential probability of *p*. The same will be true of any\ntheory that puts a safety condition on knowledge, since it will always\nbe possible that a new experience will make an agent's belief safer,\nwhile ever so slightly lowering its evidential probability.\n\nHere's the particular way I think IRI should be implemented so that it\nhas the consequence Eaton and Pickavance reveal. But note that the\nbroader response I'm making to Eaton and Pickavance doesn't turn on any\nof the details here; it turns on interests being relevant to something\nthat grounds the difference between knowledge and justified true belief.\n\nI think interests matter to knowledge because they determine whether or\nnot practical considerations generate defeaters. Someone who believes\n*p*, but has different preferences over live issues conditional on *p*\nto what they have unconditionally, is in a way incoherent. This\nincoherence defeats any claim to knowledge of *p*. This kind of defeater\nshould be interest-relative, for if it were not, we'd say that only\nthings one is completely certain of can be known. If *p* is not certain,\none prefers \\$1 to a bet that pays \\$1 iff *p*. But conditional on *p*,\none is indifferent between these bets. The interest-relativity becomes\nrelevant here; this change in preference conditional on *p* doesn't\nmatter because one isn't really faced with such a choice.\n\nIf interest-relativity matters to knowledge because it matters to\ndefeaters, or to safety, or to whatever explains Dharmottara/Gettier\ncases, then we should expect IRI to have just the consequence Eaton and\nPickavance uncover. In short, any IRI theorist who thinks interests are\nrelevant to knowledge in ways that go beyond how they are relevant to\njustified belief should view Eaton and Pickavance's results as an\ninteresting discovery, not any kind of *reductio*.\n\n[^1]: Gettier cases should perhaps be called Dharmottara cases, since\n    Dharmottara's 8th Century examples somewhat predate Gettier's, and\n    are in some ways a little cleaner. Jennifer @Nagel2014 [57] has more\n    discussion of Dharmottara.\n\n[^2]: Is this restriction to 'typical' cases necessary? Perhaps -- see\n    recent work by Federico @Luzzi2010 for a good discussion of the\n    point.\n",
