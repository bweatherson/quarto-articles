Keynes did not provide a theory of uncertainty, but he did make some enlightening remarks about the direction he thought such a theory should take. I argue that some modern innovations in the theory of probability allow us to build a theory which captures these Keynesian insights. If this is the right theory, however, uncertainty cannot carry its weight in Keynes's arguments. This does not mean that the conclusions of these arguments are necessarily mistaken; in their best formulation they may succeed with merely an appeal to risk.\ndate: April 1 2001\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1093/cje/26.1.47\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - games and decisions\n  - philosophy of economics\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1093/cje/26.1.47\njournal:\n    title: \"Cambridge Journal of Economics\"\n    publisher: \"Oxford University Press\"\nvolume: 26\nnumber: 1\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: cambridge.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n@Keynes1936 clearly saw an important role for uncertainty in his\n*General Theory*. However, few contemporaries agreed with him, and\nsubsequent 'Keynesians' generally obliterated the distinction between\nrisk and uncertainty. In part this was caused by Keynes's informal\npresentation of his views on uncertainty in *The General Theory*. This\npaper has two aims. The first is to sketch a formal theory of\nuncertainty which captures Keynes's insights about the risk/uncertainty\ndistinction. I argue that the theory of imprecise probabilities\ndeveloped in recent years best captures Keynes's intuitions about\nuncertainty. In particular this theory provides a formal distinction\nbetween risk and uncertainty, and allows for an analysis of Keynes's\n'weight' of arguments. However, the second aim is to show that if this\nis right then Keynes was wrong to draw the economic consequences of\nuncertainty that he did. In broad terms, I argue that uncertainty is\neconomically impotent. It only has effects in conjunction with some\nother feature of models or the world, such as missing markets or agent\nirrationality. But these features plus the existence of risk are\nsufficient to get the conclusions Keynes wants. These conclusions of\nKeynes might be right, but if so they can be justified without reference\nto Keynesian uncertainty. At the end of the day, uncertainty is not as\neconomically interesting as it appears.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Cambridge Journal of Economics* 26: 47-62.\n\nPicture by [Extra Medium](https://www.flickr.com/photos/70121902@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/8370641b-400d-43a1-adc6-8bb80fcb24f4).\n</aside>\n\n### Imprecise Probabilities\n\nIn the classical, or Bayesian[^1], model of rationality all rational\nagents have precise degrees of belief, or credences, in each\nproposition. There is a probability function $Bel$ such that for any\nproposition $A$, there is a number $Bel(A)$. So if an agent believes $p$\nto degree $x$ she believes $p$ to degree $1-x$. This is appropriate for\nsome propositions. For example, if $p$ is a proposition about the decay\nof an atom with known half-life, or about any event with a known\nobjective chance and hence subject to risk and not uncertainty, the\nagent's credences should reflect the chances. Since chances are precise\nand form a probability function, the credences will also have these\nproperties. The Bayesian theory assumes that all situations can be\ntreated by analogy with these.\n\nAs Keynes pointed out in the famous *QJE* article [@Keynes1937], this\nanalogy is clearly mistaken. When $p$ is about the price of copper in\nthirty years, we do not know the chance that $p$ will be true. And we do\nnot have enough information to form a precise credence. As Keynes had\nargued in his *Treatise on Probability* sixteen years earlier, attempts\nto avoid this problem by appeal to a Principle of Indifference lead to\ncontradiction. In *The General Theory* he noted that he still approved\nof this little argument [@Keynes1936 152]. Hence Bayesians have no way\nof representing our ignorance in uncertain situations. They say that all\nrational agents have a precise epistemic attitude towards each\nproposition, believing it to some precise degree, whereas ignorance\nconsists in not having such a precise attitude.\n\nThe theory of imprecise probabilities avoids all of these difficulties.\nThe theory is quite old, dating back to work by Gerhard @Tintner1941 and\nA. G. @Hart1942, but has only received extensive consideration recently.\nThe best modern summaries are by the philosopher Isaac @Levi1980 and the\nstatistician Peter @Walley1991. There are minor differences, but the\ntheory I shall give captures all the common ingredients. According to\nBayesians, states of rational agents are represented by a single\nprobability function $Pr$; in the imprecise theory they are represented\nby a set of probability functions $S$. The agent's credence in $p$ is\nvague over the set of values that $Pr(p)$ takes for $Pr \\in S$. In the\nextreme case, for every $x \\in [0, 1]$ there will be a $Pr \\in S$ such\nthat $Pr(p) = x$. This represents almost total ignorance about $p$. The\nset $S$ is called the 'representor' of the agent whose credences it\nrepresents.\n\nIt is important to stress what $S$ represents, because there has been\nsome confusion over this[^2]. The $Pr$ do not represent the agent's\nhypotheses about the correct distribution of objective chances. I use\nthe phrase 'objective chance', or just 'chance', to refer to a property\nthat plays a certain role in fundamental physics, the property which\nmakes it the case that the whirrings of atoms in the void is\nindeterminate. Modern physics, or at least the most popular versions of\nit, teaches that chance infects all fundamental physical events. These\nchances fulfill all the properties that anyone has ever wanted in\nprobabilities. They reflect long-run frequencies of repeated events,\nthey put restrictions on reasonable degrees of belief, they can be\nproperly applied to single cases, and so on. If all fundamental physical\nevents are chance events, then arbitrary Boolean combinations of\nfundamental physical events should also, presumably, be chance events.\nBut any event whatsoever is some combination of fundamental physical\nevents, though for many it may not be clear which combination. So\nbaseball games, romantic affairs and stock market movements are all\nchance events in this sense, even though they are not, for instance,\nrepeatable events. Of course, trying to predict these using the laws of\nphysics will be even less productive than trying to predict them using\nthe methods we currently have available. Saying where all the atoms, or\nquarks, currently are is humanly impossible, and perhaps theoretically\nimpossible as well. Even allowing for this, computing where they will\nmove before they get there is beyond the capacity of any possible\nmachine.\n\nI distinguish between a situation where the agent does not know the\nobjective chance of some proposition, and a situation where the agent\nhas no precise credence in that proposition. An agent can have a precise\ncredence in $p$ without knowing its objective chance. If the agent\nbelieves that a certain number of chance distributions are possible, and\ngives each of them a precise credence, this entails she has a precise\ncredence in each event. (Imagine we see a fair coin be tossed, and land,\nbut do not see how it falls. The objective chance that it shows heads is\neither one, if it does, or zero, otherwise. But the appropriate credence\nin the proposition, the coin has landed heads, is one half.) Rather the\n$Pr$ represent the precise credence distributions that are consistent\nwith real imprecise distribution. For example, for some rational agent,\nand some proposition $p$, the agent's epistemic state will determine\nthat she believes $p$ to a greater degree than 0.2, and a lesser degree\nthan 0.4, but there will be no more facts about the matter. (In this\ncase $S$ will include a function $Pr$ such that $Pr(p) = x$ for each\n$x \\in [0.2,~0.4]$.) If we ask her whether she thinks $p$ is more likely\nthan some proposition, call it $q$, which she believes to degree 0.3,\nshe will not be able to say one way or the other. And this is not just\nbecause she lacks rationality or powers of introspective observation. It\nis no requirement of rationality that she believe $p$ is more likely,\nless likely or equally likely than $q$ As Levi and Walley have pointed\nout, the Bayesian arguments purporting to show this is a constraint on\nrationality have been hopelessly circular.\n\nThe reasons for wanting to be able to represent uncertainty were\nstressed by Keynes, and are generally well known. Before showing why\nthis theory captures Keynes's intuitions about uncertainty, I will\nbriefly mention two nice formal features of the theory of imprecise\nprobabilities. On many theories of uncertainty, particularly those that\nrepresent uncertain agents as having interval valued degrees of belief,\nit is hard to explain comparative statements, like \"$p$ seems more\nlikely to me than $q$\". These comparatives are crucial to our everyday\npractices of probabilistic reasoning. We say $p$ is more probable than\n$q$ according to $S$ iff for all $Pr \\in S, Pr(p) > Pr(q)$. This lets us\nsay, as seems right, that $A$ is more probable than $A \\wedge B$ for\nalmost all propositions $A, B$.\n\nThe second formal advantage is that we now have a simple way to update\nepistemic states on receiving new evidence. Let $S$ be the agent's\ncurrent representor, and the new evidence be $e$. Then the updated\nrepresentor, $S_e$ is given as follows:\n$$S_e = \\{Pr(\\bullet | e): Pr \\in S\\}$$\n\nThat is, we just conditionalise every probability function in $S$.\nAgain, updating has proven problematic for some approaches to\nuncertainty. The theory of evidence functions, developed by\n@Dempster1967 and @Shafer1976 allows that an agent can know that if\neither $e$ or $\\neg e$ comes in as evidence, their credence in $p$ will\nrise. This seems absurd; we can know before an experiment that whatever\nhappens we'll be more confident in $p$ than we are now.\n\nTo take a famous example, three prisoners $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are about to\nbe exiled to Elba. The governor decides on a whim that he will pardon\none, and casts a fair die to choose which. He tells the guards who is\npardoned, but instructs them not to tell the prisoners yet. $X$ pleads\nfutilely with his guard, and finally asks, \"Can you tell me the name of\none of the others who won't be pardoned.\" The guard, realising this will\nnot reveal $X$'s fate, agrees to answer. $X$ thinks that if $Y$ is\npardoned, the guard will say $Z$, so there is at least a one-third\nprobability of that. And if $Z$ is pardoned, the guard will say $Y$, so\nthere is also at least a one-third probability of that. But if he is\npardoned, what the guard will have to decide what to say, and we can't\nmake probability judgements about free human decisions. On the\nDempster-Shafer theory, the probability of $X$ being freed is one-third,\nbut the probability of $X$ being freed and the guard saying $Y$ goes to\nElba is zero, and the probability of $X$ being freed and the guard\nsaying $Z$ goes to Elba is zero. This is just a standard failure of\nadditivity, and not at all objectionable. The problem is that when the\nguard says that $Y$ will go to Elba, or that $Z$ will go to Elba, the\nprobability of $X$ being freed rises to one-half. (I will not go through\nthe mathematics here, because it can be found in any book on the\nDempster-Shafer theory. See, for example, @Walley1991 or @Yager1994.)\nSince $X$ did not learn about his chances of freedom, this seems like a\nrather odd result. The theory of imprecise probabilities avoids this\nproblem. It can be easily shown that on this theory for any evidence $e$\nif the probability of $p$ given $e$ is greater than the probability of\n$p$, then the probability of $p$ given $\\neg e$ is less than the\nprobability of $p$. (Again @Walley1991 contains the proof.)\n\n### Keynes and Imprecise Probabilities\n\nObviously enough, this is not the theory that Keynes formally endorses,\neither in his *Treatise on Probability* [@Keynes1921] or his economic\nwritings. Nevertheless, I think it is an important theory for\nunderstanding Keynes's use of uncertainty. This is because it, and it\nalone, captures all of the underlying motivations of Keynes's theory of\nuncertainty. Hence any economic consequences of uncertainty Keynes wants\nto draw will have to be derivable from this theory.\n\nI have so far spoken blithely of 'Keynes's theory of uncertainty',\nimplicitly assuming there is such a unique theory. In recent years a\nnumber of authors (e.g. @Runde1994a\n[@Davis1994; @Coates1996; @Bateman1996] have questioned this assumption,\nsaying that Keynes changed his theory between the writing of the\n*Treatise on Probability* and *The General Theory*. I will not deal\ndirectly with such criticisms here for a number of reasons. First, the\nmain dispute is over whether probabilities are given by logic or are\n'merely subjective', and that debate is independent of the debate about\nthe effects of allowing imprecise probabilities. Secondly, there are\nobvious space constraints. Many of these alternative interpretations\nwere put forward in book length arguments, and a fair response to them\nwould not be short. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, I take it\nthat the methodological game here is inference to the best explanation.\nWhatever criticisms I make of others' interpretations would be rather\nweak unless I showed that some other overall story was more persuasive.\nAnd if I come up with a more persuasive story here criticisms of their\naccounts will be slightly redundant. So I hope the reader at least\npermits the indulgence of setting out a theory of Keynes's ideas\npredicated on this rather controversial assumption.\n\nIn the *Treatise on Probability* (@Keynes1921, hereafter *TP*) Keynes\nsays that probability is essentially a property of ordered pairs of\npropositions, or what he calls arguments. He writes $p / q = \\alpha$,\nfor the probability of hypothesis $p$ on evidence $q$ is $\\alpha$. Now\nthis value $\\alpha$ is rather unusual. It sometimes is a number, but\nsometimes not; it sometimes can be compared to all numbers, but\nsometimes not; it sometimes can be compared to other probability values\nsuch as $\\beta$, but sometimes not and it can enter into arithmetic\noperations. As a consequence probabilities are subject to all the usual\nrules of the classical probability calculus. For example, whenever $p$\nand $r$ are inconsistent, then $(p \\vee r) / q = p / q + r / q$ always\nholds, even when none of these values is numerical.\n\nThese five properties are rather perplexing. Indeed, Keynes's failure to\nexplain or justify them fully is one of the main criticisms that Ramsey\n[@RamseyTruthProb 161-6] launches at Keynes's theory. But on this theory\nthey all fall out as consequences of our definitions. If $p/q = \\alpha$\nthen $\\alpha$ will be numerical iff there is some $x$ such that for all\n$Pr \\in S, Pr(p | q) = x$. Similarly $\\alpha > y$, for real valued $y$,\niff $Pr(p | q) > y$ for all $Pr \\in S$. A similar definition holds for\n$\\alpha < y$ and $\\alpha = y$, from which it can be seen that it is\npossible that $\\alpha$ is neither greater than, less than, nor equal to\n$y$. If none of these hold we say that $\\alpha$ and $y$ are\nincomparable. If $p / q = \\alpha$ and $r / s = \\beta$ then\n$\\alpha > \\beta$ iff for all $Pr \\in S, Pr(p | q) > Pr(r | s)$. Again\nsimilar definitions of less than and equal to apply, and the consequence\nof all these is that sometimes $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ will be comparable,\nsometimes not.\n\nRamsey is right to question the intelligibility of Keynes's use of\naddition and multiplication. We know what it means to add and multiply\nnumbers, but we have no idea what it is to add or multiply non-numerical\nentities. However, on this theory addition and multiplication are\nperfectly natural. Since we represent $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ by sets,\ngenerally intervals, then $\\alpha + \\beta$ and $\\alpha \\dot \\beta$ will\nbe sets. They are defined as follows. Again let $p / q\\ = \\alpha$ and\n$r / s = \\beta$.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha + \\beta &= \\{x: \\exists Pr \\in S (Pr(p | q) + Pr(r | s) = x)\\} \\\\\n\\alpha \\dot \\beta &= \\{x: \\exists Pr \\in S (Pr(p | q) \\dot Pr(r | s) = x)\\} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nThese definitions are natural in the sense that we are entitled to say\nthat the '+' in $\\alpha + \\beta$means the same as the '+' in 2 + 3. And\nthe definitions show why Keynes's $\\alpha$'s and $\\beta$'s will obey the\naxioms of the probability calculus. Even if $p / q$ and $\\neg p / q$ are\nnon-numerical, $p / q + \\neg p / q$ will equal {1}, or effectively 1. So\nwe have something like the additivity axiom, without its normal\ncounterintuitive baggage. The main problem with additivity is that\nsometimes we may have very little confidence in either $p$ or $\\neg p$,\nbut we are certain that $p \\vee \\neg p$. If we measure confidence by the\nlower bound on these probability intervals, this is all possible on our\ntheory. Our technical apparatus removes much of the mystery behind\nKeynes's theory, and fends off an important objection of Ramsey's.\n\nThe most famous of Keynes's conceptual innovations in the *TP* is his\nintroduction of 'weight'. He does this in the following, relatively\nopaque, paragraph.\n\n> As the relevant evidence at our disposal increases, the magnitude of\n> the probability of the argument may either decrease or increase,\n> according as the new knowledge strengthens the unfavourable or the\n> favourable evidence; but *something* seems to have increased in either\n> case, -- we have a more substantial basis upon which to rest our\n> conclusion. I express this by saying that an accession of new evidence\n> increases the *weight* of an argument. New evidence will sometimes\n> decrease the probability of an argument, but it will always increase\n> its 'weight' [@Keynes1921 77, italics in original].\n\nThe idea is that $p / q$ measures how the evidence in $q$ is balanced\nbetween supporting $p$ and supporting $\\neg p$. The concept of weight is\nneeded if we want to also know how much evidence there is. Note that\nweight only increases when relevant evidence comes in, not when any\nevidence comes in. The weight of the argument from my evidence to\n\"Oswald killed JFK\" is not increased when I discover the Red Sox won\nlast night.\n\nThe simplest definition of relevance is that new evidence $e$ is\nirrelevant to $p$ given old evidence $q$ iff $p / q \\wedge e)= p / q$,\nand relevant otherwise. Now there is a problem. Two pieces of evidence\n$e_1$ and $e_2$ can be irrelevant taken together, but relevant taken\nseparately. For a general example, let $e_1$ be $p \\vee r$ and $e_2$ be\n$\\neg p \\vee r$, for almost any proposition $r$. If I receive $e_1$ and\n$e_2$ sequentially, the weight of the argument from my evidence to $p$\nwill have increased twice as I receive these new pieces of evidence. So\nit must be higher than it was when I started. But if I just received the\ntwo pieces of evidence at once, as one piece of evidence, I would have\nproperly regarded it as irrelevant. Hence the weight in question would\nbe unchanged. So it looks as if weight depends implausibly not on what\nthe evidence is, but on the order in which it was obtained.\n\nKeynes avoids this implausibility by tightening up the definition of\nirrelevance. He says that $e$ is irrelevant to $p / q$ iff there are no\npropositions $e_1$ and $e_2$ such that $e$ is logically equivalent to\n$e_1\\ \\wedge e_2$ and either $e_1$ or $e_2$ is relevant to $p / q$.\nUnfortunately, as I noted in the previous paragraph for virtually any\nsuch evidence proposition there will be such propositions $e_1$ and\n$e_2$. This was first noticed by @Carnap1950. Keynes, had he noticed\nthis, would have had three options. He could conceded that everything is\nrelevant to everything, including last night's baseball results to the\nidentity of Kennedy's assassin; he could have conceded that the order in\nwhich evidence appears does matter, or he could have given up the claim\nthat new relevant evidence *always* increases the weight of arguments.\n\nThe last option is plausible. @Runde1990 defends it, but for quite\ndifferent reasons. He thinks weight measures the ratio of evidence we\nhave to total evidence we believe is available. Since new evidence might\nlead us to believe there is much more evidence available than we had\npreviously suspected, the weight might go down. I believe it holds for a\nquite different reason, one borne out by Keynes's use of uncertainty in\nhis economics. In *The General Theory* (@Keynes1936, hereafter *GT*)\nKeynes stresses the connection between uncertainty and 'low weight'\n(*GT*: 148n). If we regard $p$ as merely risky the weight of the\nargument from our evidence to $p$ is high, if we regard $p$ as uncertain\nthe weight is low. In the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* article he\nargues that gambling devices are, or can be thought to be, free of\nuncertainty, whereas human actions are subject to uncertainty. So the\nintervention of humans can take a situation from being risky to being\nuncertain, and hence decrease the weight in question.\n\nFor example, imagine we are playing a rather simple form of poker, where\neach player is dealt five cards and then bets on who has the best hand.\nBefore the bets start, I can work out the chance that some other player,\nsay Monica, has a straight. So my credence in the proposition *Monica\nhas a straight* will be precise. But as soon as the betting starts, my\ncredence in this will vary, and will probably become imprecise. Do those\nfacial ticks mean that she is happy with the cards or disappointed? Is\nshe betting high because she has a strong hand or because she is\nbluffing? Before the betting starts we have risk, but no uncertainty,\nbecause the relevant probabilities are all known. After betting starts,\nuncertainty is rife.\n\nThe poker example supports my analysis of weight. If weight of argument\nrises with reduction of uncertainty, then in some rare circumstances\nweight of arguments *decreases* with new evidence. Let $[x_1, x_2]$ be\nthe set given by $\\{x: Pr(p | q) = x\\}$ for some $Pr \\in S\\}$, where $S$\nis the agent's representor. Then the weight of the argument from $p$ to\n$q$, for this agent, is $1-(x_2 - x_1)$. That is, the weight is one when\nthe agent has a precise degree of belief in $p$, zero when she is\ntotally uncertain, and increasing the narrower the interval $[x_1, x_2]$\ngets. Now in most cases new relevant evidence will increase the weight,\nbut in some cases, like when we are watching Monica, this will not\nhappen. I follow Lawson (1985) in saying that $p$ is uncertain for an\nagent with evidence $q$ iff $p / q$ is non-numerical, i.e. iff the\nweight of the argument from $q$ to $p$ is less than one. Hence we get\nthe connection between uncertainty and weight Keynes wanted. I also\nclaim that the bigger $x_2 - x_1$ is, the more $p / q$ is unlike a real\nnumber, the more uncertain $p$ is. Keynes clearly intended uncertainty\nto admit of degrees @Keynes1937, so this move is faithful to his intent.\n\nKeynes's theory of probability is based around some non-numerical values\nwhose nature and behaviour is left largely unexplained, and a concept of\nweight which is subject to a telling and simple objection. Nevertheless,\nhis core ideas, that probabilities can but need not be precise, and that\nwe need a concept like weight as well as just probability, both seem\nright for more general reasons. Hence the theory here, which captures\nthe Keynesian intuitions while explaining away his mysterious\nnon-numerical values and making the concept of weight more rigorous,\nlooks to be as good as it gets for a Keynesian theory of uncertainty.\n\nOne particularly attractive feature of the account is how conservative\nit is at the technical level. We do not need to change our *logic*,\nchange which things we think are logical truths, or which things follow\nfrom which other things, in order to support our account of uncertainty.\nThis is in marked contrast to accounts based on fuzzy logic or on logics\nof vagueness. Not only are such changes in the logic unmotivated, they\nappear to lead to mistakes. No matter how uncertain we are about how the\nstock will move over the day, we know it will either close higher or not\nclose higher; and we know it will not both close higher and not close\nhigher. The classical laws of excluded middle and non-contradiction seem\nto hold even in cases of massive uncertainty. This seems to pose a\nserious problem for theories of uncertainty based on alternative logics.\nThe best approach is one, like the theory here, which is innovative in\nhow it accounts for uncertainty, and conservative in the logic it\npresupposes.\n\nSo as a theory of uncertainty I think this account has a lot to be said\nfor it. However, it cannot support the economic arguments Keynes rests\non it.\n\n### The Economic Consequences of Uncertainty\n\nUncertainty can impact on the demand for an investment in two related\nways. First, it can affect the value of that particular investment;\nsecondly, it can affect the value of other things which compete with\nthat investment for capital. The same story is true for investment as a\nwhole. First, uncertainty may reduce demand for investment *directly* by\nmaking a person who would otherwise be tempted to invest more cautious\nand hence reluctant to invest. Secondly, if this direct impact is\nwidespread enough, it will increase the demand for money, and hence its\nprice. But the price of money is just the market rate of interest. And\nthe return that an investment must be expected to make before anyone,\neven an investor not encumbered by uncertainty, will make it is the rate\nof interest.\n\nWhen uncertainty reduces investment by increasing interest rates, I will\nsay it has an *indirect* impact on investment. Keynes has an argument\nfor the existence of this indirect impact. First, he takes the amount of\nconsumption as a given (*GT*: 245). Or more precisely, for any period he\ntakes the amount of available resources that will *not* be allocated to\nconsumption as a given. There are three possible uses for these\nresources: they can be invested, they can be saved as bonds or loans, or\nthey can be hoarded as money. There are many different types of\ninvestment, but Keynes assumes that any agent will already have made\ntheir judgement as to which is the best of these, so we need only\nconsider that one. There will also be many different length bonds which\nthe agent can hold. So as to simplify the discussion, Keynes proposes\njust treating these two at a time, with the shorter length bond called\n'money' and the longer length loan called 'debts' (*GT*: 167n). Hence\nthe rate of interest is the difference between the expected return of\nthe shorter bond over the life of the longer bond and the return of the\nlonger bond. So the rate of interest that we are interested in need not\nbe positive, and when the two bond lengths are short will usually be\nzero. However, it is generally presumed in discussions that the rate is\npositive. Now, Keynes assumes that an agent will only allocate resources\nto investment if investment looks to be at least as worthwhile as\nholding money, and at least as worthwhile as holding debts. In other\nwords, he makes the standard reduction of $n$-way choice to a set of\n2-way choices[^3]. Usually if someone is of a mind to invest they will\nnot favour holding money over holding debts. The only motivation for\nholding money, given positive interest rates, could be a desire to have\naccessible command over purchasing power, and investment foregoes that\ncommand. So in practice we only need look at two of the three possible\npairwise choices here. Hence I will ignore the choice between investing\nand holding money, and only look at the money-debt choice and the\ndebt-investment trade-off.\n\nHolding a debt provides a relatively secure return in terms of money.\nRelatively secure because there is the possibility of default. In\npractice, this means that there is not a sharp distinction between debts\nand investments, rather a continuum with say government bonds at one\nextreme and long-term derivatives at the other. Some activities that\nhave the formal structure of 'debts', like say provision of venture\ncapital, will be closer to the investment end of the continuum. Unlike\ndebts then, investments as a rule do not have a secure return in terms\nof money. In most cases they do not even have a precise expected return\n(*GT*: 149; @Keynes1937 [113]). Keynes does not presume that this means\nthat people never invest unless the expected return on the investment is\ngreater than the expected (indeed, known) return on debts. He says\nexplicitly that were this true then 'there might not be much\ninvestment'. Instead, he says that investment under uncertainty depends\non 'confidence' (*GT*: 150). Therefore, the following looks compatible\nwith his position.\n\nBayesians say that each gamble has a precise expected value. The\nexpected return on a bet that pays \\$1 if some fair coin lands heads is\n50 cents. On this theory, expected values are imprecise, because\nprobabilities are imprecise. Formally, say $E_{Pr}(G) = \\alpha$ means\nthat the expected return on $G$ according to probability function $Pr$\nis $\\alpha$. Roughly, the expected value for an agent of a gamble $G$\nwill be $\\{x: \\exists Pr \\in S: (E_{Pr}(G) = x)\\}$, the set of expected\nvalues of the bet according to each probability function in the agent's\nrepresentor. Note that these are different from the possible outcomes of\nthe bet. As we saw in the case of the coin, expected value can differ\nfrom any possible value of the bet. So let the expected value of\ninesting a certain sum be $[\\alpha, \\beta]$, and the expected value of\nbuying a debt with that money be $\\chi$. Then the agent will invest iff\n$(1 - \\rho)\\alpha + \\rho \\beta \\geq \\chi$, where $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$\nmeasures the 'state of confidence'.[^4] Now when a crisis erupts, $\\rho$\nwill go to 0, and investment will dry up. In such cases the decision\ntheory is similar to the one advanced by @Levi1980, @Strat1990 and\n@Jaffray1994. Since we are interested in a theory of unemployment, we\nare primarily interested in the cases where $\\rho$ is quite low, in\nwhich cases we can say uncertainty is reducing investment.\n\nThat last statement might seem dubious at face value. In part, what I\nmean by it is this. When $\\rho$ is low the value of a set of bets will\nin general be *more* than the sum of the value of the bets taken\nseparately. Because individual investors are fearful of exposure to\nuncertainty, which is presumably what $\\rho$ being low means, sets of\ninvestments which if undertaken collectively would be profitable (and\neveryone agrees that they would) will not be undertaken individually.\nThis suggests a reason that theorists have thought government\nintervention might be appropriate in times of crisis. Alternatively, if\n$\\rho$ is low then the value of an investment, how much we will be\nprepared to pay for it, will probably be lower than our best estimate of\nits expected return, assuming the latter to be near\n$(\\alpha + \\beta) /2$.\n\nI shall focus more closely on the indirect effects of uncertainty in\nsection 5. The central idea is that the rate of interest, being the\nprice of money, is completely determined in the market for money.\nHowever, this market has some rather strange properties. After all,\nmoney is barren, and it can generally be traded for something that is\nnot barren. So, as Keynes puts it, why would anyone 'outside a lunatic\nasylum', want it? Why would the demand for money not drop to zero as\nsoon as the rate of interest is positive?\n\n> Because, partly on reasonable and partly on instinctive grounds, our\n> desire to hold money as a store of wealth is a barometer of the degree\n> of our distrust of our own calculations and conventions concerning the\n> future \\... The possession of actual money lulls our disquietude; and\n> the premium which we require to make us part with money is the measure\n> of the degree of our disquietude [@Keynes1937 116].\n\nTherefore, more uncertainty means more demand for money means higher\ninterest rates. The rest of the story is standard. Even the confident\nagent will be disinclined to invest once the rate of interest rises.\nUsing the little decision theory outlined above, more uncertainty means\nthe gap between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ grows, which if $\\rho$ is low will\ntend to reduce $(1-\\rho)\\alpha + \\rho \\beta$, the 'certainty equivalent'\nof the expectation of the investment's worth. On the other hand,\nuncertainty on the part of the community will tend, for similar reasons,\nto increase $\\chi$. Either way, investment suffers, and hence so does\nemployment.\n\n### Uncertainty and Money\n\nThere is something very odd about all that we have done so far. Agents\nreact to uncertainty by making their returns measured in dollars more\nstable. However, in doing so they make their returns measured in any\nother good less stable. If you have no idea what the price of widgets\nwill be in twelve months time, then holding only widgets increases the\nuncertainty about how many dollars you will be worth then. However, it\nmakes you more certain about how many widgets you will be worth. Why\nthis preference for money? We deserve an explanation as to why one kind\nof uncertainty is given such a central place and other kinds are\ncompletely ignored.\n\nKeynes has one explanation. He argues, or perhaps assumes, essentialism\nabout money. Indeed the title of chapter 17 of *The General Theory* is\n'The Essential Properties of Interest and Money'. These essential\nproperties are entirely functional. As Hicks puts it, \"Money is defined\nby its functions \\... money is what money does\" [@Hicks1967 1]. The\nexplanation is that agents try to minimise uncertainty relative to\nwhatever plays the functional role of money. Therefore, the explanation\ndoes not rely on any mystical powers of dollar bills. Rather, the work\nis done by the functional analysis of money.\n\nAs a first approximation, the functional role money plays is that it is\na medium of exchange. Keynes does not think this is quite the essential\nproperty; rather he says that money is essentially 'liquid', and\nperceived to be liquid. This means that if we hold money we are in a\nposition to discharge obligations and make new purchases as they seem\nappropriate with greatest convenience and least cost. Even this is not\nwhat is given as the official essential property of money. To make the\nproof that demand for money is not demand for labour easier Keynes takes\nthe essential properties of money to be its negligible elasticities of\nproduction and substitution. However, he makes clear that these are\nimportant because of their close connection to liquidity (*GT*: 241).\nIndeed, when he comes to define a non-monetary economy, he simply\ndefines it as one where there is no good such that the benefits it\nconfers via its liquidity, its 'liquidity premium' exceeds the carrying\ncosts of the good. So the properties of having a negligible elasticity\nof production and substitution seem necessary but insufficient for\nsomething to be money.\n\nThe reason that money uncertainty is more problematic than widget\nuncertainty is just that money is liquid. At the end of the day, the\npoint of holding investments, bonds or money is not to maximise the\nreturn in terms of such units; it is to be used somehow for consumption.\nHence, we prefer, *ceteris paribus*, to store wealth in ways that can be\neasily exchanged for consumption goods as and when required. Further, we\nmay be about to come across more information about productive uses for\nour wealth, and if we do, we would prefer to have the least\ninconvenience about changing how we use wealth. Money is going to be the\nbest store of wealth for each of these purposes. The strength of these\npreferences determines the liquidity premium that attaches to money.\n\nSo Keynes's story here is essentially a 'missing markets' story. If\nthere were markets for every kind of transaction there would be no\nliquidity premium attaching to money, and hence no reason to be averse\nto uncertainty in terms of money returns as opposed to uncertainty in\nterms of X's shares returns. There is a methodological difference here\nbetween decision theorists and economists. In decision theory it is\ncommon to specify what choices an agent does have. These will usually be\nfinite, or at least simply specified. In economics it is more common to\nspecify what choices an agent does not have, which markets are\n'missing'. In a sense the difference is purely cosmetic, but it can\nchange the way problems are looked at. Since Keynes requires here some\nmarkets to be missing, it might be worth investigating what happens here\nfrom the more restrictive framework ordinarily applied in decision\ntheory.\n\nIn some decision-theoretic contexts, we can prefer liquidity even when\nwe are completely certain about what our choices are and what their\noutcomes will be. Say we are in a game where the object is to maximise\nour money over 2 days. We start with \\$100. On day 1, we have a choice\nof buying for \\$100 a ticket that will pay \\$200 at the end of day 2,\nand is non-transferable, or doing nothing. On day 2, if we still have\nour \\$100, we can buy with it a voucher which pays \\$300 at the end of\nday 2, or do nothing. Obviously, the best strategy is to do nothing on\nday 1, and buy the voucher on day 2. The point is just that money here\nhas enough of a liquidity premium on day 1 that we are prepared to hold\nit and earn no interest for that day rather than buy the ticket (or two\nday bond) which will earn interest. So uncertainty is not a necessary\ncondition for liquidity premia to exist. On the other hand, perhaps it\nis necessary for liquidity premia to exist in a world something like\nours, where agents neither have all the choices they would have in a\nperfect market, nor as few as in this simple game. If we added a market\nfor tickets and vouchers to our simple game the prices would be fixed so\nthat money would lose its liquidity premium. Keynes suggests something\nlike this is true for the worlds he is considering: \"*uncertainty* as to\nthe future course of the rate of interest is the sole intelligible\nexplanation of the type of liquidity preference \\[under consideration\\]\"\n(*GT*: 201). However here he merely means lack of certainty; there is no\nproof that if every agent had precise credences liquidity preference\nought to disappear. So it looks like uncertainty in the sense discussed\nhere, vague reasonable beliefs, does no theoretical work. Perhaps this\nis a bit quick, as the little game I considered is so far from a\nreal-life situation. So I will look more closely at the effects\nuncertainty is supposed to have. Since it has received the bulk of the\ntheoretical attention, I start with the indirect effects of uncertainty.\n\n### Uncertainty and Liquidity Preference\n\nKeynes thinks the question of why money is demanded at all, why we do\nnot all move from holding money into holding debts as soon as the rate\nof interest goes positive, needs answering. And he thinks the answer\nhere will be particularly relevant to theories about the rate of\ninterest. If the market in general is at equilibrium then the market in\ntrades between any two goods must also be in equilibrium; in particular\nit cannot be that there are people holding money who would be prepared\nto buy debts at the current interest rate. So if the equilibrium\ninterest rate is positive, there must be some people who would prefer to\nhold money than hold debts. This fact Keynes takes to be central to the\ncorrect theory of the rate of interest. Hence, to determine what the\nrate of interest will be, and what will cause it to change, I need to\ndetermine what causes a demand for money.\n\nKeynes distinguishes four motives for holding money (*GT*: Ch. 13;\n[@Keynes1937b 215-223]). Two of these, the transactions motive and the\nfinance motive, need not detain us. They just relate to the need to make\npayments in money and on time. The third, the speculative motive, is\noften linked to uncertainty, and indeed Keynes does so (*GT*: 201). But\n'uncertainty' here is just used to mean absence of certainty, that is\nthe existence of risk, which as noted above is not how I am using\n'uncertainty'. As @Runde1994b points out, an agent who is certain as to\nfuture movements in interest rates may still hold money for speculative\nreasons, as long as other agents who are not so certain have made\nmistaken judgements. The fourth motive will hold most of my attention.\nKeynes argues that we may hold money for purely precautionary reasons.\n\n> To provide for contingencies requiring sudden expenditure and for\n> unforeseen opportunities of advantageous purchases, and also to hold\n> an asset of which the value is fixed in terms of money to met a\n> subsequent liability fixed in terms of money, are further motives for\n> holding cash (*GT*: 196).\n\n@Davidson1988 [@Davidson1991] justifies this as follows. Uncertainty\narises whenever agents do not have sufficient knowledge to calculate the\nnumerical probability of an event. This is given a rather frequentist\ngloss in Davidson, but that is not necessary. His idea is that we know\nwhat the probability of $p$ is when we know the frequency of $p$-type\nevents in the past and we know the future will resemble the past in this\nrespect. The latter is cashed out as saying $p$ is governed by an\n'ergodic process'. We can replace all this by saying that $p$ is subject\nto uncertainty whenever we do not know its objective chance, whether or\nnot objective chance ought to be analysed by frequentist approaches.\nDavidson then argues that since for most $p$ we do not have this\nknowledge, we have to adopt 'sensible' approaches like holding money.\n\n@Runde1994b objects that Davidson's story is incoherent. On Davidson's\ntheoretical story there are only two epistemic states relative to $p$\nthat are possible. An agent can know the chance of $p$, in which case\ntheir credence is set equal to it, or they are completely uncertain\nabout it. In the latter case there can be no reason for taking some\naction rather than another. Now the reason that it is 'sensible' to hold\nmoney is that we expect money to be liquid. However, we do not know the\nchance of money remaining liquid; whether or not money remains liquid is\nnot determined by an ergodic process. Hence, we have no reason for\nletting that partial belief be a guide to action.\n\nThis is a fair criticism, but it can be met by amending the theory\nrather than by giving it up. On my theory, if an agent knows the chance\nof $p$ they will have a precise degree of belief in $p$. When they do\nnot their degree of belief will, in general, be vague but not totally\nvague. As with Keynes, I have uncertainty come in degrees. This\namendment is enough to rescue Davidson's theory. An agent might not know\nthe chance that money will become illiquid in the next short period of\ntime, but they might know enough for it to be reasonable to have a\ncredence in that proposition which is vague over some small interval\nclose to zero. It may still be sensible to hold some money even when the\nexpected return on other investments really is vague. But is it sensible\nto prefer fixed to uncertain returns? In other words, is there a direct\neffect of uncertainty that makes people prefer bonds to investments?\n\n### Uncertainty and Indecision\n\nAs Keynes repeatedly stressed, investment is not like a game of chance\nwhere the expected results are known in advance. And this is part of the\nexplanation for the extreme instability in investment levels compared to\nother economic variables.\n\n> The state of long-term expectation \\... does not solely depend on the\n> most probable forecast we can make. It also depends on the\n> *confidence* with which we make this forecast (*GT*: 148).\n>\n> Human decisions affecting the future, whether personal or political or\n> economic, cannot depend on strict mathematical expectation, since the\n> basis for making such calculations does not exist \\... it is our\n> innate urge to activity which makes the wheels go round, our rational\n> selves choosing between the alternatives as best we are able,\n> calculating where we can, but often falling back for our motive on\n> whim or sentiment or chance (*GT*: 162-3).\n\nThe most charitable reading of Keynes here is to say he agreed, in\nprinciple, with what is sometimes referred to as a Horwitz-style\ndecision rule. If the expected return of an investment is vague over\n$[\\alpha, \\beta]$ then its 'value' is given by\n$(1-\\rho)\\alpha + \\rho \\beta$, where $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$ is a measure of\nconfidence. By the 1937 article, he has become more interested in the\nspecial case where confidence has collapsed and $\\rho$ is approaching 0.\nThis interpretation would explain all his references to decision-making\nunder uncertainty in *The General Theory* and subsequent discussion,\nprovided we make the safe assumption that 'cold calculation' would only\nhave us spend $x$ on an investment with expected return\n$[\\alpha, \\beta]$ when $\\alpha \\geq x$. In particular, any\ninterpretation of the underlying decision theory here will have to give\nsome role to 'whim or sentiment or chance', and I give it a variable,\n'$\\rho$'. With this theory, I have the extensions needed to avoid\nRunde's objection to Davidson. I have a continuum of degrees of\nuncertainty, rather than a raw dichotomy, and I have an explanation of\nwhy it is 'sensible' to prefer gambles with known expected returns, at\nleast when $\\rho$ is relatively low.\n\nThis theory is meant to serve two related purposes. It is meant to show\nwhy we might prefer money to debts, even though our best estimate of the\nexpected return of the debts is positive, and again it is meant to show\nwhy we might prefer debts to investments even when our best estimate of\nthe expected return of the investment is higher. And I think if the\ndecision rule stipulated were plausible, it would show that uncertainty\ndid have an economic effect. In particular, I think it would show both\nthat in times of crises when $\\rho$ heads down, the level of investment\nwill decrease even with other things being equal, and that collective\naction can be justified even when individual action is not. That is, the\ngovernment can make sets of investments that are expected to be\nprofitable although none of the individual investments is expected to be\nprofitable.\n\nThe decision theory does not, however, seem plausible. First, there are\nsome technical problems for this theory. The problem is that if\n$\\rho < \\frac{1}{2}$, then in cases where uncertainty is guaranteed to\nincrease in the near future agents following this rule will make\ndecisions they are sure to regret. For example, assume an agent with\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{3}$ now has credence $\\frac{1}{2}$ in $p$, but knows\nthat some evidence will come in such that her credence in $p$ will\nbecome vague over $[0.3, 0.7]$ whatever the result of the experiment. As\nwe saw in the case of poker players, this is plausible in some\nsituations. The agent will now pay 50 cents for a bet which pays \\$1 if\n$p$ and nothing otherwise, but after the evidence comes in she'll sell\nthat bet for about 44 cents, incurring a sure loss. I leave it to the\nreader to judge the importance of these technical problems, given the\nrarity of cases where uncertainty is guaranteed to rise.\n\nThere is also a philosophical problem. What precisely is $\\rho$ supposed\nto represent? If it is some kind of belief, its effects should have been\nincorporated into the credences. If it is some kind of desire its\neffects should have been incorporated into the evaluation of each of the\nstates. This objection could be avoided, perhaps, if Keynes was trying\nto argue against the theory that investors just maximise dollar expected\nreturns. It is not entirely clear whom Keynes thinks he is arguing\nagainst at some points. If this is his enemy, he is fighting a straw\nman, one who is vulnerable to much simpler objections. Whoever thought\nthat all investment is profit driven, that no one ever went into\nbusiness because they thought it would be fun to run a newspaper?\nKeynes's only viable opponents here are saying that investors calculate\nthe expected return, in utils, of each possible investment and choose\nthe one whose returns are highest. Now perhaps for many dollar returns\nare the most important factor in determining util returns, but this is\ncertainly not the only cause.\n\nIf $\\rho$ represents something which is neither a belief nor a desire,\nthen it is hard to see what effect it could have on action. Perhaps\nthere are some exceptions to the rule that actions are caused only by\nbeliefs and desires combining in the right way, such as actions caused\nby values, but these appear irrelevant to Keynes's considerations, and\nhe does not appeal to such exemptions. After all, he describes\ninvestment decisions made where the 'cold calculations' do not determine\nwhat should be done as being made by 'whim or sentiment or chance'. Now\nwhims and sentiments are surely desires, although chance is in a\ndifferent boat. If he had just said 'chance' here he may have committed\nhimself to a different decision theory, one where the agent can under\nuncertainty make any decision which is not known to be sub-optimal. But\nthis does not justify the conclusion that uncertainty decreases\ninvestment; under that theory it is random whether uncertainty increases\nor decreases investment. Hence Keynes appears to be implausibly\ncommitted to a mental state which is neither a belief nor a desire but\naffects action.\n\nIt might be objected here that I am relying on an overly individualistic\ntheory of motivation; that what Keynes is committed to is nothing more\nthan what anyone who has learned the difference between Robinson Crusoe\neconomics and real-world economics would believe. There is an important\ntruth behind this objection: the social causes of action cannot be\noverlooked. But this is not what I have done. The core assumption I made\nis that the only mental states relevant to action are beliefs and\ndesires. Now the beliefs and desires that are relevant may not be\n(directly) concerned with the action at hand; they may be beliefs and\ndesires about how society will view this action, or about similar\nactions which may or may not be performed by other members in society.\nAnd the beliefs and desires may not have as their immediate cause\ncareful inference by the agent in question; they may be caused by the\nwave of panic or optimism in which the agent is caught up. In the real\nworld, agents do not always change their beliefs and desires by\nreflection on new evidence, often emotion plays a larger role. So\nsociety has both evidential and non-evidential effects on action. But\nevery time, the causal chain goes via the beliefs and desires of the\nagent. Society causes actions by causing changes in the beliefs and\ndesires of individuals. It is wrong to think that action is never caused\nby beliefs and desires about society, it is wrong to think that society\nnever directly causes beliefs and desires which lead to action, but none\nof this implies that there can be mental states other than belief and\ndesire relevant to action.\n\n### Disquietude\n\nThere are some comments from Keynes that suggest this reading is a\nlittle unfair. Rather than having a distinctive decision theory, he\nperhaps has a distinctive theory about what ought enter into the\ndecision-theoretic calculations. The standard theory for why there is a\ndemand for insurance is the falling marginal utility of money. Agents\npurchase insurance, and accept a lower expected dollar return because\nwith insurance their expected util return, at the end of the duration of\nthe insurance, is higher than if they had not purchased. This is the\nstory given in, for example, @FreidmanSavage1952 where the existence of\ndemand for insurance is taken as evidence for the declining marginal\nutility of money. But there is another reason agents might buy\ninsurance. They might simply feel happier, over the duration of the\ninsured period, knowing that they have insurance and are hence exposed\nto fewer risks or uncertainties than otherwise. If this is true then\ntheir expected 'wealth' in both dollars and utils at the end of a period\nmight be lower if they insure than if otherwise, but it will be\nworthwhile because of the benefits during the period. Keynes suggests\nthat this same desire for quietude can cause a demand for money. I\npresume, though it is not entirely clear, that this desire should be\nincluded within the precautionary motives for holding money.\n\n> There are not two separate factors affecting the rate of investment,\n> namely, the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital \\[the\n> expected return of investments\\] and the state of confidence. The\n> state of confidence is relevant because it is one of the major factors\n> determining the former (*GT*: 149).\n>\n> For the fact that each individual investor flatters himself that his\n> commitment is \"liquid\" \\... calms his nerves and makes him much more\n> willing to run a risk (*GT*: 160).\n>\n> The possession of actual money lulls our disquietude; and the premium\n> which we require to make us part with money is the measure of the\n> degree of our disquietude [@Keynes1937 116].\n>\n> A liquidity premium \\... is not even expected to be rewarded. It is a\n> payment, not for the expectation of increased tangible income at the\n> end of the period, but for an increase sense of comfort and confidence\n> during the period [@Keynes1938 293-294].\n\nThis explanation of the demand for certain returns is in some ways\nconservative and some ways radical. It is conservative because it does\nnot immediately change the technical properties of preference. Many\nheterodox theories of preference drop such theoretical restrictions as\ntransitivity of preferences. By contrast the theory Keynes appears to be\nadvocating is it least in principle conservative on this front. Agents\nare still going round maximising expected utility, just now it is\nexpected utility over a period, not at the end of the period.\n\nBut it is not all conservative. If we explain economic decisions in\nterms of the disquietude of the investor we discard the distinction\nbetween investment and consumption. It was always known that there were\nsome goods that were not comfortably categorised, particularly cars, but\nthis move makes every good in part a consumption good. If all this meant\nwas that some helpful classifications have to be questioned, it would\nnot be important. Rather, its importance flows from its implications for\nthe norms for investment. It is always irrational to make an investment\nwhich will incur a sure loss. This principle is used to derive\nwide-ranging implications for decision-theory. But it is not irrational\nto make a consumption decision which will result in sure loss at the end\nof a period in exchange for goods during that period. It is not always\nirrational to pay ten dollars for a movie ticket, even though this will\nincur a sure loss in the sense the buyer will surely have less wealth at\nthe end of the movie than if they had not bought the ticket.\n\nGiven this, the technical complaint I raised against the Horvitz-style\ndecision rule misses the target. And the philosophical concern about\nwhat $\\rho$ represents is irrelevant. If the expected returns only\nmeasure how much various gambles will be worth at the end of the period,\nthen some desires have not yet been included in our calculations. That\nis, $\\rho$ represents some desires but the theory is not guilty of\ndouble-counting. So far this all seems to work, and explain the role of\nuncertainty. Indeed, I think this is the best extension of Keynes's\nviews in this area.\n\nWhile there seem to be few theoretical objections which can be raised at\nthis point, there is a rather telling empirical objection. The only role\ngiven to disquietude in this theory is in deciding between alternatives\nwhere the returns on at least one are uncertain. But it seems\nimplausible that disquietude could have this effect, but have no effect\nwhen choices are being made between alternatives where at least one is\nrisky. I doubt the feelings of disquiet would be any different were I to\nhave a large fortune riding on a roulette wheel or a baseball game.\nDisquietude arises because we do not know what will happen; maybe for\nsome people it is greater when we do not know the expected returns, but\nI doubt it. Again, perhaps there is an explanation for demand for money\nin the real world to be found here, but uncertainty plays no role in the\nstory, or at best a small cameo.\n\n### Summary\n\nKeynes argued that uncertainty has a major economic impact. By driving\npeople to store their wealth in ways with more stable returns, it\nincreases the demand for cash and decreases the demand for investments.\nNot only does it drive down investments in this direct way, the\nincreased demand for cash leads to higher interest rates and hence\npeople are driven out of investment into bonds. However, there are a few\nproblems with the story. First, the motivation for demanding returns\nfixed with respect to a certain good can only be that the markets\nbetween that good and other goods are more complete. But if that is the\ncase there is a reason to demand that good even when the world is\ncompletely certain. Secondly, the only decision-theoretic justification\nfor this demand for fixed returns could be the disquiet generated by not\nknowing the return. This follows from the formalisation of uncertainty\nadvocated in sections 1 and 2. But this disquiet could just as easily be\ngenerated by risk as by uncertainty. So Keynes has not shown that\nuncertainty has any particular economic impact. That's the bad news. The\ngood news is that many of the arguments seem to work without the\nreliance on uncertainty.\n\n[^1]: For this paper I follow @Walley1991 in describing those theorists\n    who require that all agents have precise degrees of belief and these\n    degrees form a probability function as Bayesians. There is some\n    dispute as to the accuracy of this labelling, particularly as some\n    paradigm case Bayesians, such as @Jeffrey1983 and @vanFraassen1990,\n    accept that degrees of belief can be vague. However, there is\n    probably no other name as convenient or as recognisable.\n\n[^2]: See, for example, @GardenforsSahlin1982, @Levi1982.\n\n[^3]: Standard, but I bring it up because the modern theorist whose\n    decision theory is closest to the one Keynes seems to adopt, Levi,\n    explicitly rejects it.\n\n[^4]: In case the reader fears I am being absurdly formal with an\n    essentially informal idea, Keynes had such a variable, there\n    described as measuring the 'state of the news', in early drafts, but\n    it did not survive to the final stage. So my proposal is not a\n    million miles from what Keynes intended merely by virtue of being\n    algebraic.\n",
