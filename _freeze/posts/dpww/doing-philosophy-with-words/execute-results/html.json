After praising the book's virtues, I raise three points where I dissent from Soames' take on the history. First, I suggest that there is more to ordinary language philosophy than the rather implausible version of it that Soames sees to have been destroyed by Grice. Second, I argue that confusions between analyticity, necessity and priority are less important to the ordinary language period than Soames takes them to be. Finally, I claim that Soames' criticisms of Ryle turn in part on attributing reductionist positions to Ryle that Ryle did not hold.\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\njournal: \n  title: \"Philosophical Studies\"\n  publisher: Springer\nvolume: 135\nissue: 3\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-006-9026-3\ndoi: 10.1007/s11098-006-9026-3\ndate: October 25 2006\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\ncategories:\n  - book symposium\n  - history of analytic\n  - language\n  - on books\nself-contained: false\npreview: soames.jpeg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: TRUE\n---\n\n\n\nScott @Soames2003 has written two wonderfully useful books that will be\nvaluable introductions to twentieth century philosophy. The books arose\nout of his well-received classes on the history of twentieth century\nhistory at Princeton, and will be valuable to anyone teaching similar\ncourses. I shall be relying on them as I teach such a course at Cornell.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Philosophical Studies* 135 (2007): 429-37. \n</aside>\n\nThe books consist of detailed case studies of important\ntwentieth-century works. They are best read alongside those original\ntexts. Anyone who works through the canon in this way will have an\nexcellent introduction to what twentieth century philosophers were\ntrying to do. The selections are judicious, and while some are obvious\nclassics some are rather clever choices of papers that are\nrepresentative of the type of work being done at the time. And Soames\ndoesn't just point to the most important works to study, but the most\nimportant sections of those works.\n\n<aside>\nThanks to David\n    Chalmers, Michael Fara, John Fischer, Tamar Szabó Gendler, James\n    Klagge, Michael Kremer, Ishani Maitra, Aidan McGlynn, Alva Noë,\n    Jonathan Weinberg and Larry Wright.\n</aside>\n\nSoames's discussion of these pieces is always built around an analysis\nof their strengths and weaknesses. He praises the praiseworthy, but the\nfocus, at least in the sections I'm discussing (ordinary language\nphilosophy from Wittgenstein to Grice), is on where these philosophers\ngo wrong. This is particularly so when the mistakes are representative\nof a theme. There are three main mistakes Soames finds in philosophers\nof this period. First, they rely logical positivism long after it had\nbeen shown to be unviable. Second, they disregard the principle that\nsemantics should be systematic. Third, they ignore the distinction\nbetween necessity and a priority. All three constitute major themes of\nSoames's book, and indeed of twentieth century philosophy as Soames sees\nit.\n\nThese books concentrate, almost to a fault, on discussion of\nphilosophers' published works, as opposed to the context in which they\nare written. Apart from occasionally noting that some books were\nreleased posthumously, we aren't told whether the philosophers who wrote\nthem are alive, and only in one case are we told when a philosopher was\nborn. This kind of external information does not seem important to\nSoames. He is the kind of historian who would prefer a fourth reading of\nAustin's published works to a first reading of his wartime diaries. And\nhe'd prefer to spend the evening working on refutations, or charitable\nreformulations, of Austin's arguments to either. I'm mostly sympathetic\nto this approach; this is history of *philosophy* after all. We can\nleave discussions of the sociology of 1950s Oxford to those better\nqualified. But this choice about what to write about has consequences.\n\nMost of Soames's chapters focus almost exclusively on a particular book\nor paper. The exceptions are like the chapter on *Sense and Sensibilia*,\nwhere Soames contrasts Austin's discussion with Ayer's response. We\nlearn a lot about the most important works that way, but less about\ntheir intellectual environment. So the book doesn't have much by way of\nbroad discussion about overall trends or movements. There's very little,\nfor example, about who were the influencers and who the influenced.\nThere's nothing about how anyone not called 'Wittgenstein' changed their\npositions in response to criticism. One assumes from the chronology that\nRyle's influence on Austin was greater than Austin's influence on Ryle,\nfor example, but Soames is silent on whether this is true.\n\nSoames says at one point that, \"[Ryle] was, along with Wittgenstein,\nJ. L. Austin, and Paul Grice, one of the prime movers in postwar\nphilosophy in England.\" (68). But we aren't really told why this is so,\napart from the discussion of some prominent works of these four\nphilosophers. (Perhaps Soames has taken the maxim *Show it, don't say\nit* rather completely to heart.) Nor are why told why the list includes\nthose four, and not, say, Strawson or Geach or Anscombe. Actually\nAnscombe's absence reminds us that there is almost no discussion of\nwomen in philosophy in the book. That's not Soames fault, it's a\nreflection of a long-running systematic problem in philosophy that the\ndiscipline has a hard time recruiting and retaining women. Could some of\nthat be traced back to what was going on in the ordinary language\nperiod? That kind of questions *can't* be addressed by the kind of\nhistory book that Soames has written, where the focus is on the best\nphilosophical writing, and not on the broader philosophical community.\n\nOne of the other consequences of the format is that, by necessity, many\nimportant figures are left out, on pain of writing a fifteen-volume\nbook. In the period under discussion here there was historically\nimportant work by (among many others) Nelson Goodman, Wilfrid Sellars\nand Roderick Chisholm, some of which connects up closely to the themes\nand interests of the ordinary language philosophers, but none of which\nis as much as mentioned. (Goodman is mentioned in the epilogue as\nsomeone Soames regrets not covering.)\n\nNow this can't be a complaint about the book Soames has written, because\nit would have been impossible to cover any more figures than he did in\nthe style and depth that he did. And it would have been impossible to\ntell in detail the story of how Ryle's impact on the philosophical world\ndiffered from Austin's, or of the painfully slow integration of women\ninto the top echelons of philosophy, without making the book be even\nmore monumental than it is. All we're left with is a half-hearted\nexpression of regret that he didn't write a different *kind* of book,\none that told us more about the forest, even as we value what he says\nabout the tallest of the trees.\n\n### Grice and The End of Ordinary Language\n\nThere is one place where Soames stops to survey the field, namely his\ndiscussion of the impact of Grice's work on the ordinary language\ntradition. Soames argues that with Grice's William James lectures, the\nidea of ordinary language philosophy had \"run their course\". The\nposition seems to be that Grice overthrew a paradigm that had been\nvibrant for two decades, but was running out of steam by the time of\nGrice's James lectures. How plausible is this?\n\nThe first step is to work out just what it was that @Grice1989 refuted.\nWhen summarising the ordinary language paradigm that he takes Grice to\nhave overthrown, Soames is uncharacteristically harsh. In Soames's\nsummary one of the characteristic activities of an ordinary language\nphilosopher is \"opportunistically assembling reminders about how\nphilosophically significant words are used in ordinary settings\" (216).\nThat *may* be a fair enough description of *some* mid-century work, but\nit isn't a fair summary of the best of the work that Soames has spent\nthe previous two hundred odd pages discussing. It all suggests that\nGrice didn't so much overthrow ordinary language philosophy as much as\nbadly done ordinary language philosophy, and this category might not\ninclude Strawson, Ryle, Austin and so on.\n\nMore importantly, it isn't entirely clear just what it was Grice did\nthat caused this paradigm shift. In Soames's telling it seems the\ndevelopment of the speaker meaning/semantic meaning distinction was\ncrucial, but @Austin1962 at least already recognised this distinction,\nindeed appealed to it twice in *Sense and Sensibilia*. Soames mentions\nthe discussion on pages 89 to 91 of *Sense and Sensibilia* of phrases\nlike \"I see two pieces of paper\", and there is also the intriguing\ndiscussion on pages 128-9 of the relation between *accurate* and *true*\nwhere Austin goes close to stating Grice's submaxim of concision.\n\nThe other suggestion is that Grice restored the legitimacy and\ncentrality of systematic semantic theorising. It's true Grice did that,\nbut this doesn't show we have to give up ordinary language philosophy\nunless it was impossible to be an ordinary language philosopher and a\nsystematic semanticist. And it isn't clear that this really is\nimpossible. It hardly seems *inconsistent* with the kind of philosophy\nAustin did (especially in his theory of perception) that one endorse a\nsystematic semantic theory. (Though Austin *himself* rarely put forward\nsystematic analyses.) Notably, there are plenty of very systematic\nformal semanticists who take Strawson's work on descriptions seriously,\nand try and integrate it into formal models. So we might wonder why\nGrice's work shouldn't have led to a kind of ordinary language\nphilosophy where we paid more careful attention to system-building.\n\nMore broadly, we might wonder whether the ordinary language period\nreally did end. The analysis of knowledge industry (strangely\nundiscussed in a work on *analysis* in the twentieth century) seemed to\nputter along much the same before and after the official demise of\nordinary language philosophy. And there are affinities between the\nordinary language philosophers and important contemporary research\nprograms, e.g. the 'Canberra Plan' as described by Frank @Jackson1998.\nSo perhaps before we asked who killed ordinary language philosophy (It\nwas Professor Grice! In Emerson Hall!! With the semantics/pragmatics\ndistinction!!!) we should have made sure there was a corpse. More on\nthis point presently.\n\n### A Whig History?\n\nOne of the major themes of Soames's discussion is that there are some\nsystematic problems in twentieth century philosophy that are righted by\nthe heroes at the end of the story. I already mentioned the heroic role\nassigned to Grice. But the real star of the show is @Kripke1980, who\ncomes in as a deus ex machina at the end showing how different necessity\nand a priority are, and thereby righting all manner of grievous wrongs.\nThat Kripke is an important figure in twentieth century philosophy is\nhardly a matter of dispute, but Soames does stretch a little to find\nerrors for our hero to correct.\n\nSome of the complaints about philosophers collapsing the necessary/a\npriori distinction do hit the target, but don't leave deep wounds in\ntheir victims. For instance, Soames quotes @Ryle1954 arguing (in\n*Dilemmas*) that perception cannot be a physiological process because if\nit were we couldn't *know* whether we saw a tree until we found out the\nresult of complicated brain scans. Soames points out, perfectly\ncorrectly, that the seeing might be necessarily identical to the brain\nprocess even if we don't know, and even can't know without complicated\nmeasurements, whether they are identical. Soames is right that Ryle has\nmade an epistemological argument here when a metaphysical argument was\nneeded. But rewriting Ryle so he makes that metaphysical argument isn't\nhard. If my seeing the tree is necessarily identical to the brain\nprocess, and the brain process is (as Ryle and Soames seem to agree it\nis) individuated by the brain components that implement it, then I\ncouldn't have seen the tree had one of the salient neurons in my brain\nbeen silently replaced with a functionally equivalent silicon chip.\nSince it *is* possible that I could have seen a tree even if a salient\nneuron was replaced with a functionally equivalent silicon chip, the\nseeing and the brain process are not necessarily identical. So while\nRyle might have slipped here, and Kripke's work does help us correct the\nslip, the consequences of this are basically verbal.\n\nA more important charge of ignoring the necessary/a priori distinction\ncomes in Soames's discussion of Wittgenstein's deflationism about\nphilosophy. Here is the salient passage.\n\n> His deflationary conception of philosophy is also consistent with, and\n> even derivative from, his new ideas about meaning plus a set of\n> unquestioned philosophical presuppositions he brings to the\n> enterprise. The philosophical presuppositions include the then current\n> and widespread assumptions that (i) that philosophical theses are not\n> empirical, and hence must be necessary and a priori, and (ii) that the\n> necessary, the a priori and the analytic are one and the same. Because\n> he takes these assumptions for granted, he takes it for granted that\n> if there are any philosophical truths, they must be analytic (29).\n\nThis seems to me to be mistaken twice over.\n\nFirst, it isn't clear to me that there is *any* appeal to concepts of\nnecessity in the passages in Wittgenstein Soames is summarising here,\nand metaphysical necessity simply doesn't seem to have been a major\ninterest of Wittgenstein's. Wittgenstein does appear to reason that if a\nproposition is not empirical it is a priori, but that inference doesn't\ngo via claims about necessity, and isn't shown to be fallacious by any\nof Kripke's examples.\n\nSecond, it simply isn't true that philosophers in Wittgenstein's time\ntook for granted that the analytic and the a priori were one and the\nsame. To be sure, many philosophers in the early twentieth century\n(including many argue the younger Wittgenstein) argued against Kant's\nclaim that they are distinct, but this isn't quite the same as taking\nfor granted they are identical. And there are a few places where\nWittgenstein appears to accept that some propositions are synthetic a\npriori. For example in *Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics* he\nsays it is synthetic a priori that there is no reddish green, (Part III,\npara 39) and goes on to say this about primes.\n\n> The distribution of primes would be an ideal example of what could be\n> called synthetic a priori, for one can say that it is at any rate not\n> discoverable by an analysis of the concept of a prime number.\n> [@Wittgenstein1956 Part III, para 42]\n\nNow it is far from obvious what the connection is between remarks such\nas these and the remarks about the impossibility of philosophical theses\nin the *Investigations*. Indeed it is not obvious whether Wittgenstein\nreally believed in the synthetic a priori at any stage of his career.\nBut given his lack of interest in metaphysical necessity, and openness\nto the possibility of synthetic a priori claims, it seems unlikely that\nhe was, tacitly or otherwise, using the argument Soames gives him to get\nthe deflationary conclusions.[^2]\n\n### Getting the Question Right\n\nAs I mentioned above, Soames's is the kind of history that focuses on\nthe works of prominent philosophers, rather than their historical\ncontext. There's much to be gained from this approach, in particular\nabout what the greats can tell us about pressing philosophical\nquestions. But one of the costs is that in focussing on what they say\nabout *our* questions, we might overlook *their* questions. In most\ncases this is a trap Soames avoids, but in the cases of Austin and Ryle\nthe trap may have been sprung.\n\nSoames sees Austin in *Sense and Sensibilia* as trying to offer us a new\nargument against radical scepticism.\n\n> Austin's ultimate goal is to undermine the coherence of skepticism.\n> His aim is not just to show that skepticism is unjustified, or\n> implausible, or that it is a position no one has reason to accept.\n> Rather, his goal is to prevent skepticism from getting off the ground\n> by denying skeptics their starting point. (173-4)\n\nBut we don't get much of an interpretative argument that this is really\nAustin's goal. Indeed, Soames concedes that Austin \"doesn't always\napproach these questions directly\" (172). I'd say he does very little to\napproach them at all. To be sure, many contemporary defenders of direct\nrealism are interested in its anti-sceptical powers, but there's little\nto show *Austin* was so moved. Scepticism is not a topic that even\narises in *Sense and Sensibilia* until the chapter on Warnock, after\nAustin has finished with the criticism of Ayer that takes up a large\npart of the book. And Soames doesn't address the question of how to\nsquare the somewhat dismissive tone Austin takes towards scepticism in\n\"Other Minds\" with the view here propounded that Austin put forward a\nfairly radical theory of perception as a way of providing a new answer\nto the sceptic.\n\nIf Austin wasn't trying to refute the sceptic, what was he trying to do?\nThe simplest explanation is that he thought direct realism was true,\nsense-data theories were false, and that \"there is noting so plain\nboring a the constant repetition of assertions that are not true, and\nsometimes no even faintly sensible; if we can reduce this a bit, it will\nall be to the good.\" [@Austin1962 5] I'm inclined to think that in this\ncase the simplest explanation is the best, that Austin wrote a series of\nlectures on perception because he was interested in the philosophy of\nperception. Warnock says that \"Austin was genuinely shocked by what\nappeared to his eye to be recklessness, hurry, unrealism, and inadequate\nattention to truth\" [@Warnock1989 154] and suggests this explained not\nonly why Austin wrote the lectures but their harsh edge.\n\nThere is one larger point one might have wanted to make out of a\ndiscussion of direct realism, or that one might have learned from a\ndiscussion of direct realism, that seems relevant to what comes later in\nSoames's book. If we really see objects, not sense-data, then objects\nare constituents of intentional states. That suggests that public\nobjects might be constituents of other states, such as beliefs, and\nhence constituents of assertions. Soames doesn't give us a discussion of\nthese possible historical links between direct realism and direct\nreference, and that's too bad because there could be some fertile ground\nto work over here. (I'm no expert on the history of the 1960s, so I'm\nsimply guessing as to whether there is a historical link between direct\nrealism and direct reference to go along with the strong philosophical\nlink between the two. But it would be nice if Soames has provided an\nindication as to whether those guesses were likely to be productive or\nfutile.)\n\nSoames gives us no inkling of where theories of direct reference came\nfrom, save from the brilliant mind of Kripke. Apart from the absence of\ndiscussion of any connection between direct realism and direct\nreference, there's no discussion of the possible connections between\nWittgenstein's later theories and direct reference, as Howard\n@Wettstein2004 has claimed exist. And there's no discussion of the\n(possibly related) fact that Kripke was developing the work that went\ninto *Naming and Necessity* at the same time as he was lecturing and\nwriting on Wittgenstein, producing the material that eventually became\n*Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*. Kripke is presented here\nas the first of the moderns[^3], and in many ways he is, but the ways in\nwhich he is the last (or the latest) of the ordinary language\nphilosophers could be a very valuable part of a history of\nphilosophy.[^4]\n\nMatters are somewhat more difficult when it comes to Ryle's *The Concept\nof Mind*. Ryle predicted that he would \"be stigmatised as\n'behaviourist'\" [@Ryle1949 327] and Soames obliges, and calls him a\nverificationist to boot.\n\n> If beliefs and desires were private mental states [says Ryle], then\n> we could never observe the beliefs and desires of others. But if we\n> couldn't observe them, then we couldn't know that they exist, [which\n> we can.] ... This argument is no stronger than verificationism in\n> general, which by 1949 when *The Concept of Mind* was published, had\n> been abandoned by its main proponents, the logical positivists, for\n> the simple reason that every precise formulation of it had been\n> decisively refuted (97-8).\n\nBut Ryle's position here isn't verificationism at all, it's\nabductophobia, or fear of inference to underlying causes. Ryle doesn't\nthink the claim of ghosts in the machine is *meaningless*, he thinks it\nis false. The kind of inference to underlying causes he disparages here\nis *exactly* the kind of inference to unobservables that paradigm\nverificationists, especially Ayer, go out of their way to *allow*, and\nin doing so buy all end of trouble.[^5] And abductophobia is prevalent\namong many contemporary *anti*-verificationists, particularly direct\nrealists such as @McDowell1996, @Brewer1999 and @Smith2003 who think\nthat if we don't directly observe beer mugs we can never be sure that\nbeer mugs exist. I basically agree with Soames that Ryle's argument here\n(and the same style of argument recurs repeatedly in *The Concept of\nMind*) is very weak, but it's wrong to call it verificationist.\n\nThe issue of behaviourism is trickier. At one level Ryle surely is a\nbehaviourist, because whatever *behaviourism* means in philosophy, it\nincludes what Ryle says in *The Concept of Mind*. Ryle is the\nreference-fixer for at least one disambiguation of *behaviourist*.\nHowever we label Ryle's views though, it's hard to square what he says\nhis aims are with the aims Soames attributes to him. In particular,\nconsider Soames's criticism of Ryle's attempt to show that we don't need\nto posit a ghost in the machine to account for talk of intelligence.\n(Soames is discussing a long quote from page 47 of *The Concept of\nMind*.)\n\n> The description Ryle gives here is judicious, and more or less\n> accurate. But it is filled with words and phrases that seem to refer\n> to causally efficacious internal mental states---*inferring*,\n> *thinking*, *interpreting*, *responding to objections*, *being on the\n> lookout for this*, *making sure not to rely on that*, and so on.\n> Unless all of these can be shown to be nothing more than behavioral\n> dispositions, Ryle will not have succeeded in establishing that to\n> argue intelligently is simply to manifest a variety of purely\n> behavioral dispositions. (106)\n\nAnd Soames immediately asks\n\n> So what are the prospects of reducing all this talk simply to talk\n> about what behavior would take place in various conditions? (106)\n\nThe answer, unsurprisingly, is that the prospects aren't good. But why\nthis should bother *Ryle* is never made clear. For Ryle only says that\nwhen we talk of mental properties we talk about people's dispositions,\nnot that we talk about their *purely behavioural* dispositions. The\nlatter is Soames's addition. It is rejected more or less explicitly by\nRyle in his discussion of knowing how. \"Knowing *how*, then, is a\ndisposition, but not a single-track disposition like a reflex or a habit\n... its exercises can be overt or covert, deeds performed or deeds\nimagined, words spoken aloud or words heard in one's head, pictures\npainted on canvas or pictures in the mind's eye.\" [-@Ryle1949 46-47].\nNor should Ryle feel compelled to say that these dispositions are\nbehavioural, given his other theoretical commitments.\n\nRyle is opposed in general to talk of 'reduction' as the discussion of\nmechanism on pages 76ff shows. To be sure there he is talking about\nreduction of laws, but he repeatedly makes clear that he regards laws\nand dispositions as tightly connected [-@Ryle1949 43, 123ff] and\nsuggests that we use mental concepts to signal that psychological rather\nthan physical laws are applicable to the scenario we're discussing\n(167). Moreover, he repeatedly talks about mental events for which it is\nunclear there is any kind of correlated *behavioural* disposition, e.g.\nthe discussion of Johnson's stream of consciousness on page 58 and the\nextended discussion of imagination in chapter 8. Ryle's claim that\n\"Silent soliloquy is a form of pregnant non-sayings\" (269) hardly looks\nlike the claim of someone who wanted to reduce all mental talk to\nbehavioural dispositions, unless one leans rather hard on 'pregnant'.\nBut we aren't told whether Soames leans hard on this word, for he never\nquite tells us why he thinks all the dispositions that Ryle considers\nmust be behavioural dispositions, rather than (for example) dispositions\nto produce other dispositions.\n\nTo be sure, from a modern perspective it is hard to see where the space\nis that Ryle aims to occupy. He wants to eliminate the ghosts, so what\nis left for mind to be but physical stuff, and what does physical stuff\ndo but behave? He's not an eliminativist, so he's ontologically\ncommitted to minds, and he hasn't left anything for them to be but\nbehavioural dispositions. So we might see it (not unfairly) but that's\nnot how Ryle sees it.[^6] Soames sees Ryle as an ancestor of a reductive\nmaterialist like David Lewis, and a not very successful one at that. But\nthe Ryle of *The Concept of Mind* has as much in common with\nnon-reductive materialists, especially when he says that \"not all\nquestions are physical questions\" [-@Ryle1949 77], insists that \"men are\nnot machines, not even ghost-ridden machines\" [-@Ryle1949 81] and\ndescribes Cartesians rather than mechanists as \"the better soldiers\"\n[-@Ryle1949 330] in the war against ignorance. Perhaps a modern\nanti-dualist should aim for a reduction of the mental to the physical,\nbut Ryle thought no such reduction was needed to give up the ghost, and\nthe historian should record this.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs I said at the top, Soames has written two really valuable books. For\nanyone who wants to really understand the most important philosophical\nwork written between 1900 and 1970, reading through the classics while\nconstantly referring back to Soames's books to have the complexities of\nthe philosophy explained will be immensely rewarding. Those who do that\nmight feel that the people who skip reading the classics and just read\nSoames's books get an unreasonably large percentage of the benefits\nthey've accrued. As noted once or twice above I have some quibbles with\nsome points in Soames's story, but that shouldn't let us ignore what a\ngreat service Soames has provided by providing these surveys of great\nphilosophical work.\n\n[^2]: I'm grateful to many correspondants for discussions about\n    Wittgenstein. They convinced me, inter alia, that it would be\n    foolish of me to commit to strong views of any kind about the role\n    of the synthetic a priori in Wittgenstein's later thought, and that\n    the evidence is particularly messy because Wittgenstein wasn't as\n    centrally concerned with these concepts as we are.\n\n[^3]: The first of what David @Armstrong2000 has aptly called \"The Age\n    of Conferences\".\n\n[^4]: Just in case this gets misinterpreted, what I'm suggesting here is\n    that Kripke (and his audiences) might have been influenced in\n    interesting ways by philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s, *not* that\n    Kripke took his ideas from those philosophers. The latter claim has\n    been occasionally made, but on that 'debate'\n    [@Soames1998a; @Soames1998b] I'm 100% on Soames's side.\n\n[^5]: It would be particularly poor form of me to use a paradigm case\n    argument without discussing Soames's very good dissection of\n    Malcolm's paradigm case argument in chapter 7 of his book. So let me\n    note my gratitude as a Cornellian for all the interesting lines of\n    inquiry Soames finds suggested in Malcolm's paper -- his is a\n    paradigm of charitable interpretation, a masterful discovery of\n    wheat where I'd only ever seen chaff.\n\n[^6]: Of course he *couldn't* have seen it that way since in 1949 he\n    wouldn't have had the concept of ontological commitment.\n",
