Agents do not always have to infer what the past was like from how things currently seem; sometimes the facts about the past are retained pieces of evidence that can be the start of reasoning. The main argument is a variant on Frank Arntzenius’s Shangri La example, an example that is often used to motivate the thought that evidence does supervene on current features.\ndate: December 1 2015\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1080/00455091.2015.1125250\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - games and decisions\n  - imprecise probability\ncitation_url: https://10.1080/00455091.2015.1125250\njournal:\n    title: \"Canadian Journal of Philosophy\"\n    publisher: \"Cambridge University Press\"\nvolume: 45\nnumber: 5\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: shangrila.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\nI know a lot about the past. I know, for instance, that the Chicago\nWhite Sox won the 2005 baseball World Series. I remember that's true. I\ndon't remember the event. I was in Australia, and it wasn't on\ntelevision. I don't even remember the event of learning that the White\nSox won. But I remember that they won. And to remember something is to,\ninter alia, know it is true. And to know something is to, inter alia,\nhave a rational belief that it is true.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Canadian Journal of Philosophy_ 45: 692-715\n</aside>\n\nSo I have a rational belief that the White Sox won the 2005 baseball\nWorld Series. In virtue of what is this belief of mine rational? That's\ntoo big a question to answer here, so let's start narrowing it down. Is\nthis belief rational in virtue of facts about how I now am, or\nhistorical facts about me? Call the former view a temporally local\ntheory of rationality, and the latter a temporally extended view. Which\nof those is correct?\n\nI'm going to defend the temporally extended view. In this respect I'm\nfollowing recent work by David James @Barnett2015, though being a\nphilosopher I'll quibble about his argument, put forward alternate\nreasons, and so on. But I'm agreeing with his big conclusion.\n\nAt least, I'm going to agree with a version of that conclusion. I'm an\nevidentialist about rationality, in a sense that I'll try to make\nclearer as we progress through the paper. So it's natural to convert the\ncore question into a question about evidence, and about evidence\nacquisition. What is my evidence that the White Sox won the 2005 World\nSeries, and in virtue of what do I have that evidence? Is it the currect\nfact that it mnemonically seems to me that the White Sox won, perhaps\nsupplemented with some knowledge I have about the reliabiity of my\nmnemonic seemings? Or is it something more temporally extended? I'm\ngoing to argue that it is the latter.\n\nMy positive view, inspired to some extent by the *evidence is knowledge*\nview defended by Timothy @Williamson2000, is that the fact the White Sox\nwon became part of my evidence some time in 2005, and has stayed in my\nevidence ever since. At the time this belief, and this knowledge, was\ngrounded in further evidence, presumably perceptual evidence of what\nsome computer screen looked like. But I came to know the White Sox won,\nand this became part of my evidence. An alternative view is that the\nvisual seemings from 2005 are part of my evidence still. That's what the\nview of David @Lewis1996b implies. And yet another view is that the\ncontent of those perceptions, perhaps that ESPN is telling me the White\nSox won, is still in my evidence. I don't like either of these latter\nviews, but I'm not going to argue about them here. Rather, the focus is\non whether evidence is contemporary or historical, and I want to argue\nfor the class of historical theories over the class of contemporary\ntheories.\n\n## Evidentialism\n\nI'm interested in memory because it raises challenges for the\nevidentialist theory I'd like to defend. Evidentialism, as we'll start\nconstruing it, says that the doxastic attitudes it is rational to have\ndepend entirely on the evidence one has. This is a version of\nevidentialism. I'm taking this to be a thesis both about partial\nbeliefs, what are commonly called credences in the philosophical\nliterature, and full beliefs. I have a lot to say elsewhere about the\nrelationship between full and partial belief  [@Weatherson2012], but I\nwon't be relying on those views here.\n\nI am construing the 'dependence' in the statement of evidentialism\nrather weakly. It is just a claim that the evidence one has, and the\nattitudes it may be rational to hold, co-vary. Put another way, the\nrationality of doxastic attitudes supervenes on one's evidence, at least\nthroughout worlds similar enough to this one. I am not defending the\nstronger claim that facts about what evidence one has are always\nexplanatorily prior to facts about what doxastic attitudes it is\nrational to hold.\n\nIt is easy enough to imagine epistemologies that aim for this more\nambitious, priority, thesis. David @Lewis1996b, for instance, suggests\nwe should understand evidence in terms of phenomenal states; two agents\nwith the same phenomenology over time have the same evidence. It's\narguable that facts about phenomenology are metaphysically prior to\nfacts about rationality. So, if one was an evidentialist with Lewis's\ntheory of evidence, it would be natural to think that facts about\nevidence didn't just subvene facts about rationality; the former\nprovided full and perhaps reductive explanations for the latter.\n\nI hold out no such hope for reductive explanations. Indeed, I'm closer\nin spirit to the kind of view you might read into Timothy\n@Williamson2000. As noted above, Williamson holds that one's evidence is\nall and only what one knows. This thesis has become known as E=K. The\nnotation here is instructive. It is commonplace to introduce new terms\nby definition by putting the new term on the left-hand side of an\nequality sign. $A =_{df} B$ means that $A$ is defined to be identical to\n$B$, not the other way around. The E=K thesis suggests a form of\nevidentialism where evidence is in fact explanatorily posterior to\nrationality. Something is part of one's evidence in virtue of the fact\nthat one knows it, and arguably one only knows what one rationally\nbelieves.\n\nI've been a bit coy in the previous paragraph about what I'm attributing\nto Williamson, and what I'm just saying can be read into him. That's\nbecause the view Williamson defends is not that rationality has\nexplanatory priority, but that knowledge does. As he says in the first\nline of his book, his view is \"knowledge first\"  [@Williamson2000 v].\nAnd it's consistent with 'knowledge first' to say that the explanatory\nrelationship between evidence and rationality is complicated and\nmulti-directional. Although I don't endorse the knowledge first program,\nI agree with that last conclusion. The explanatory relationship between\nevidence and rationality is complicated and multi-directional.\nEvidentialism should not be construed as denying this claim.\n\nThe other way in which my version of evidentialism is weaker than it may\nbe is that it really is restricted to being a claim about rationality.\nIt isn't a claim about justification. For all I say here, maybe\nsomething other than evidence determines whether a doxastic attitude is\njustified. For example, it may be that only true beliefs are justified.\nI don't think that's true, but if it is it would be consistent with\nevidentialism as I'm construing it.\n\nMore importantly for what follows, evidentialism also isn't a claim\nabout wisdom. It is very important to keep evaluations of agents apart\nfrom evaluations of acts or states. It is attitudes or states that are\nin the first instance rational or irrational. We can talk about rational\nor irrational agents, but such notions are derivative. Rational agents\nare those generally disposed to have rational attitudes, or be in\nrational states. Wisdom, on the other hand, is in the first instance a\nproperty of agents. Again, we can generalise the term to attitudes or\nstates. A wise decision, for instance, is one that a wise person would\nmake. But the wisdom of agents is explanatorily and analytically prior\nto the wisdom of their acts, judgments, decisions and attitudes. (I\nthink that everything I've said in this paragraph is true of ordinary\nEnglish. But I'm not committed to that, and it doesn't matter if I'm\nwrong. You can read this paragraph as stipulating that 'rational' is to\nbe used as a term that in the first instance applies to states, and\n'wise' is to be used as a term that in the first instance applies to\nagents, and little will be lost.)\n\nEvidentialism is not a claim about the nature of wise agents. Perhaps a\nwise agent is one who always has rational attitudes. If so, then\nevidentialism will have quite strong implications for what wise agents\nare like. But that connection between wisdom and rationality is far from\nan obvious conceptual truth. For all I've said, it may well be wise to\nhave doxastic attitudes that do not track one's evidence. That is\nconsistent with evidentialism, provided we understand the relevant\nsituations as being ones where it is unwise to have rational attitudes.\n\nThe most important recent work on the connection between rationality and\nwisdom is by Maria @Lasonen-Aarnio2010 [@Lasonen-Aarnio2014]. And I\nagree with almost everything she says about the connection. The biggest\ndifference between us is terminological. She uses 'reasonable' and\n'reasonableness' where I use 'wise' and 'wisdom'. In my idiolect, I find\nit too easy to confuse 'rational' and 'reasonable'. So I'm using a\ndifferent term, and one that, to me at least, more strongly suggests a\nfocus on agents, not states. But this is a small point, and everything I\nsay about the distinction draws heavily on Lasonen-Aarnio's work.\n\nFinally, I'm not taking evidentialism to be committed to any kind of\nuniqueness thesis. It may be that different agents with the same\nevidence can have different views about *p*, and both be rational.\nThat's fine, as long as any agent with just that evidence could have\neither view about *p* and be rational. The view is that there's a\nfunction from evidence and attitude to rational evaluation, not that\nthere's a function from evidence to rational attitude.\n\n## Memory and Testimony {#memoryandtestimony}\n\nIt's natural to think about theories of memory by analogy to theories of\ntestimony. Indeed, we see this strategy used in otherwise very different\nwork by Sarah @Moss2012 and David James @Barnett2015. Moss and Barnett\nhave very different views on memory, and very different views on the\nrelationship between memory and testimony, but they both find it\nworthwhile to situate views about memory in relation to views about\ntestimony. And I will follow this lead.\n\nFor an evidentialist, there are three interesting classes of theories of\ntestimony. These almost, but not quite, track onto familiar categories\nof theories in the literature on testimony. I'll use slightly\nidiosyncratic names for them, just to indicate that the categories\naren't exactly the same. In all cases, speaker *S* says that *p* on the\nbasis of evidence *E*, and hearer *H* hears (and understands) the\nspeaker. (And I'll assume *S* is a she, and *H* a he.) I'm going to\nstart with the case where *S* knows that *p*, and *H* has no reason to\ndoubt *S*'s testimony; we'll look at the complications that ensue when\nthose assumptions are dropped presently.\n\nThe classes I'm interested in are divided by their answers to two\nquestions:\n\n1.  Is the evidence that *H* gets, in the first instance, that *p*, or\n    that *S* said that *p*?\n\n2.  If the evidence is only that *S* said that *p*, is the fact that *S*\n    said that *p* a 'self sufficient' reason to believe that *p*, or\n    does it need to be supplemented?\n\nThe term 'self sufficient' is borrowed from Anna-Sara @Malmgren2006, who\nuses it in describing work by Crispin @Wright2002 [@Wright2004], James\n@Pryor2004 and Roger @White2005. Wright, Pryor and White are primarily\nconcerned with whether perceptual appearances are self sufficient\nreasons to believe their contents, or they need to be supplemented. That\nisn't the focus here; like Malmgren I'm focussing on testimony and\nmemory.\n\nHere are the three classes of views that you get from the natural\nanswers to those questions.\n\nIndirect Theories of Testimony.\n\n:   The evidence is that *S* said that *p*, and this is not a\n    self-sufficient reason to believe that *p*. This class closely\n    corresponds to the class of so-called reductionist theories of\n    testimony. Jennifer @Lackey2008 provides an important recent\n    indirect theory.\n\nDirect Theories of Testimony.\n\n:   The evidence is that *S* said that *p*, and this is a\n    self-sufficient (though defeasible) reason to believe that *p*. Many\n    theorists who reject reductionism about testimony endorse what I'm\n    calling a direct theory. C. A. J. @Coady1995 provides an important\n    recent direct theory.\n\nTransmission Theories of Testimony.\n\n:   The evidence is that *p*, so it doesn't matter how we answer the\n    second question. Frederick @Schmitt2006 provides an important recent\n    transmission theory.\n\nTransmission theories need not deny that *H* also gets the evidence that\n*S* said that *p*. And they need not take a stand on how good that\nevidence is as evidence that *p*. And direct theories need not deny that\n*H* may have independent evidence that if *S* says that *p*, then *p* is\ntrue. But in the other direction, I'm taking it as characteristic of the\ntheories that they deny the core claims of the ones that come after\nthem. So indirect theories deny that *H* immediately gets evidence that\n*p*, or that *S* says that *p* is a self sufficient reason to believe\n*p*. And direct theories deny that *H* immediately gets evidence that\n*p*.\n\nThe direct and transmission theories just say that a certain thing is\npossible. I haven't said yet what they have to say about when it\npossible. To make matters a little less abstract, I'll focus for now on\ntheories that abide by the following constraints.\n\n-   *S* saying that *p* is only reason to believe that *p* in the\n    absence of evidence against *p*, and in the absence of evidence\n    against *S*'s reliability.\n\n-   *H* only gets to add *p* to their stock of evidence if it was in\n    *S*'s stock of evidence to start with; testimony doesn't generate\n    evidence, except for evidence about what is said.\n\nA direct theory that didn't comply with the first constraint really\nwould be a charter for gullibility. Even with this constraint, direct\ntheories possibly are too gullible, as Elizabeth @Fricker1994 has\nargued, but without this constraint they certainly are. And a\ntransmission theory that didn't comply with the second constraint would\nnot deserve the name transmission; it would be a generative theory.\n\nWe can use these categories to draw three similar categories of memory.\nHere the case is that *M* forms a belief that *p* at $t_1$, and has an\napparent memory of *p* at $t_2$. As we might put it, her memory reports\nthat *p* at this time. As above, start with the simple case where *M*\nknows *p* at $t_1$, and there is no counterevidence, or reason to doubt\nher own reliability, at later times. We'll come back, in great detail,\nto cases where those assumptions are relaxed. What evidence does *M*\nget, in these simple cases, when her memory reports that *p*, and how\ngood is this evidence?\n\nIndirect Theories of Memory\n\n:   The evidence is that *M*'s memory reports that *p*, and this is not\n    a self sufficient reason to believe that *p*.\n\nDirect Theories of Memory\n\n:   The evidence is that *M*'s memory reports that *p*, and this is a\n    self sufficient reason to believe that *p*.\n\nTransmission Theories of Memory\n\n:   The evidence is that *p*.\n\nThe first two theories are temporally local, in the sense I started\nwith, and the last is temporally extended. Again, we'll put some\nrestrictions in place.\n\n-   Memory's reporting that *p* is only a self sufficient reason to\n    believe that *p* in the absence of either evidence against *p*, or\n    evidence that memory is unreliable.\n\n-   Memory only transmits evidence that *p* if *p* was genuinely among\n    *M*'s pieces of evidence at an earlier time. And that requires, I'm\n    assuming, that *M* knew that *p* at the earlier time.[^1]\n\nSince I want to defend a temporally extended theory, that means I'm\ndefending the transmission theory. And like Barnett, I do so while\nrejecting the corresponding theory of testimony.[^2] But once we set\nthings out this way, we see that there are two distinct temporally local\ntheories, and they fail for slightly different reasons. Before we get to\nwhy they fail, we'll look at a reason for thinking one or other of them\nmust work.\n\n## Shangri La {#shangrila}\n\nThe Shangri La case introduced by Frank @Arntzenius2003 can be used to\ngenerate an argument that evidentialists are committed to the temporally\nlocal approach to evidence. This isn't exactly how Arntzenius introduced\nit; he introduced it as a puzzle for conditionalisation. But the\nargument I'm interested in is related to the puzzle Arntzenius\nintroduced. Here is how Michael Titelbaum describes the example.\n\n> You have reached a fork in the road to Shangri La. The guardians of\n> the tower will flip a fair coin to determine your path. If it comes up\n> heads, you will travel the Path by the Mountains; if it comes up\n> tails, you will travel the Path by the Sea. Once you reach Shangri La,\n> if you have traveled the Path by the Sea the guardians will alter your\n> memory so you remember having traveled the Path by the Mountains. If\n> you travel the Path by the Mountains they will leave your memory\n> intact. Either way, once in Shangri La you will remember having\n> traveled the Path by the Mountains. The guardians explain this entire\n> arrangement to you, you believe their words with certainty, they flip\n> the coin, and you follow your path. What does ideal rationality\n> require of your degree of belief in heads once you reach Shangri La.\n>  [@Titelbaum2014 120]\n\nThe name of the person Titelbaum's narrator is addressing isn't given,\nso we'll call him Hugh. And we'll focus on the case where Hugh actually\ntravels by the Mountains.\n\n![Original Shangri La game; Hugh takes the right-hand path](http://brian.weatherson.org/images/mbt-fig1.png)\n\nThere is something very puzzling about Hugh's case. On the one hand many\nphilosophers (including Arntzenius and Titelbaum) report a strong\nintuition that once in Shangri La, Hugh should have equal confidence\nthat he came by the mountains as that he came by the sea. On the other\nhand, it's hard to tell a dynamic story that makes sense of that. When\nhe is on the Path by the Mountans, Hugh clearly knows that he is on that\npath. It isn't part of the story that the paths are so confusingly\nmarked that it is hard to tell which one one is on. Then Hugh gets to\nShangri La and, well, nothing happens. The most straightforward dynamic\nstory about Hugh's credences would suggest that, unless something\nhappens, he should simply retain his certainty that he was on the Path\nby the Mountains.\n\nAnd you might think evidentialism is committed to the same thing as that\ndynamic story. To see why, imagine that Hugh is being terrifically\nsneaky, and wearing a small camera in his glasses. The camera is\ntracking what he sees, and Laurie is watching it on a distant TV\nmonitor. The guardians can't do anything to Laurie's memory, so they\ndon't, just like they don't do anything to Hugh. That night, it might\nseem Hugh and Laurie have the same evidence. Yet, according to some\nintuitions, it is rational for Laurie to believe that Hugh took the Path\nby the Mountains, and not rational for Hugh to believe this.\n\nHere's a natural way out of that bind. Say that the evidence Hugh and\nLaurie have does not consist of what they saw as Hugh was ascending, but\ntheir current mnemonic seemings. Now their evidence is different. Hugh\nhas the evidence that it seems to Hugh that Hugh ascended via the\nmountains, and Laurie has the evidence that it seems to Laurie that Hugh\nascended via the mountains. And it is common knowledge that in either\nthis world or a nearby one, Hugh's mnemonic seemings are unreliable,\nwhile Laurie's are reliable in all nearby worlds. So the temporally\nlocal theories can handle the problem, while one might think temporally\nextended theories cannot.\n\nThe most straightforward way to explain the common intuition about\nShangri La is via the indirect theory of memory. On that theory, Hugh\nwon't know that he came to Shangri La via the mountains. That's because\nthe report of his memory, \"We got here via the mountains, Hugh!\", would\nbe the same however he came up, and Hugh knows it. There is no basic\nentitlement, on this theory, to move from *My memory says that p* to\n*p*, and since Hugh does not even believe that a correlation obtains in\npractice between what he believes about his method of ascent and how he\nactually ascended, there is no earned entitlement.\n\nIt is a little tempting to read some of the published arguments that\nHugh can't know he came via the mountains as reasoning in just this way.\nHere is Arntzenius's central argument. (Assume Arntzenius is talking to\nHugh here, so 'you' picks out Hugh.)\n\n> For you will know that he would have had the memories that you have\n> either way, and hence you know that the only relevant information that\n> you have is that the coin was fair.  [@Arntzenius2003 356]\n\nSarah @Moss2012 makes a similar claim about the case. (Again, her\nnarration is addressed to Hugh.)\n\n> Intuitively, even if you travel on the mountain path, you should have\n> .5 credence when you gets to Shangri La that the coin landed heads.\n> This is a case of abnormal updating: once you arrive in Shangri La,\n> you can no longer be sure that you traveled on the mountain path,\n> because you can no longer trust your apparent memory.  [@Moss2012\n> 241--2]\n\nNow it isn't immediately clear why the fact that Hugh would have the\nsame apparent memories in the two cases should matter. As far as I can\nsee, the only way it could matter is if the following two things were\ntrue. First, we are using a temporally local theory, so the evidence is\nwhat Hugh's memory reports when he is in Shangri La, not the evidence he\nacquired on the trip up the mountain. And second, what those appearances\nsupport is solely a function of things internal to the agent, and not,\nsay, their connection to the truth. As an evidentialist, I'm committed\nto a version of that second assumption - at least, I'm committed to\nsaying that things that over-ride evidence must themselves be evidence.\n\nLet's focus for now on the assumption of temporal localism behind the\narguments here. I'm going to offer a series of arguments against it,\nstarting with a variant on the Shangri La case.\n\n## Iterated Shangri La {#iteratedshangrila}\n\nHere's a slightly more complicated variant of the Shangri La example.\n\n> Sati walks up to the base of the paths to Shangri La. \"Have some toast\n> and yeast extract,\" says one of the attendants, somewhat stiltedly.\n>\n> \"Yeast extract?\" says Sati.\n>\n> \"Yes, yeast extract. Vegemite or Marmite, your choice.\".\n>\n> \"Must I?\" says Sati.\n>\n> \"You must.\"\n>\n> \"Well, Vegemite then,\" says Sati, recalling fond memories of having\n> Vegemite in Australia, and dire memories of that trip to the English\n> countryside.\n>\n> \"Good choice,\" says the attendant. Sati has her Vegemite on toast, and\n> heads up the mountain path to Shangri La, as directed. On the way, she\n> notices a worried looking person standing in front of a priest about\n> to flip a coin. When she gets to Shangri La, she asks the attendant\n> about that.\n>\n> \"Oh,\" says the attendant, \"he chose Marmite.\" Sati looks confused as\n> to why this is relevant, so the attendant continues. \"The priests\n> don't like people who choose Marmite, but they still must let them\n> through. So they flip a coin to decide whether they will go by the sea\n> or the mountains. Then, if they went by the sea, they will wipe the\n> memory of that trip, and replace it with a memory of going through the\n> mountains.\"\n>\n> \"I'm glad that didn't happen to me. Lucky I chose Vegemite.\"\n>\n> \"Recently,\" continued the attendant, \"the priests decided to make\n> things more complicated. They decided they would also wipe the memory\n> of having eaten the Marmite, and hence facing the coin flip. Instead\n> they would implant a false memory of having chosen Vegemite, indeed\n> false memories of having preferred Vegemite to Marmite in the past,\n> plus a false memory of seeing some other poor sap facing the coin\n> flip. They really really don't like Marmite eaters.\"\n>\n> \"So all the Marmite eaters get memories wiped?\" asked Sati.\n>\n> \"No, only if the coin lands the wrong way. So some people get to the\n> top thinking they liked Marmite. But we only tell that memories of\n> going by the sea will be wiped. In fact, knowing they chose Marmite is\n> evidence they went by the Mountains, but they don't know that.\"\\\n> \"It all sounds horrible,\" says Sati. \"I'm so glad I remembered I liked\n> Vegemite more than Marmite.\"\n>\n> \"Have a good day!\" said the attendant, grinning.\n\nI think that Sati's last statement is correct; she does remember that\nshe likes Vegemite more than Marmite. Indeed, she knows this in virtue\nof her memory. But it's not clear how a temporally local theory, either\ndirect or indirect, can get that answer.\n\nImagine someone, call him Joe, who starts off in the same situation as\nSati at the base of the mountain. Sadly, due to an unfortunate\nunbringing, he prefers Marmite to Vegemite, so he takes that. And then\nthe coin lands the wrong way, and he is sent by the sea. Then his\nmemories are wiped and replaced with fake memories when he gets to\nShangri La.\n\n![Revised Shangri La game; Sati takes the right-hand path, Joe the left- hand path](http://brian.weatherson.org/images/mbt-fig2.png)\n\nIf a temporally local theory is correct, then presumably Sati and Joe\nhave the same evidence. And that means if evidentialism is true, then it\nis rational for them to believe the same things. Yet that is\nimplausible; Joe should not be very confident that he had the Vegemite,\ncame by the mountains, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, it is overdetermined that Sati can know she came by\nthe Mountains. The crucial difference between Sati and Hugh comes from\nthe defeasibility conditions on the transmission theory. Past memories\nthat *p* transform into current evidence that *p* unless they are\nforgotten, or the agent gets some good reason to suspect that her memory\nis unreliable. Hugh has such a reason; he is a coin flip away from\nhaving faulty memories. Sati does not have such a reason. She knows that\nhad she had a very different kind of upbringing, and had she been on the\nbad end of a coin flip, she would have had faulty memories. But a reason\nto think that had things been different she would have reason to\ndistrust her memories is not, itself, a reason to distrust her memories.\n\nSati's case is not meant to be a close call. There are lots of relevant\nways in which her case is different to cases in which the defeasibility\nclause is triggered. The fact that two different kinds of things need to\nhave gone wrong here is relevant. And the fact that the first requires\nthings going wrong for a long long time into the past is relevant. And\nthe fact that the first is only a problem in very different possible\nworlds to actuality is relevant. In short, any plausible kind of\ndefeasibility condition whatsoever on the transmission theory will mean\nthat Joe's memories of going by the sea are not transmitted, but only an\nimplausibly strong defeasibility condition will prevent Sati's memories\nfrom being transmitted.\n\nNote that I have not said that Sati can trust her memories because the\nprobability of them being unreliable is so low. That is not the way to\nformulate defeasibility conditions. The sense of probability that is\nrelevant here is evidential probability. And evidential probability is,\nas the name suggests, explanatorily posterior to evidence possession. We\nshould not use evidential probability in our theory of what evidence the\nagent has. Sati knows she grew up liking Vegemite, despite the Shangri\nLa shenanigans. But that's not because it is so improbable that she had\nher memories wiped. Rather, it is improbable she had her memories wiped\nbecause she knows she does not meet the conditions under which memories\nare wiped.\n\nSo temporally extended theories can distinguish Sati's case from Joe's,\nas intuition requires that they be distinguished. But temporally local\ntheories seem to have a problem here. Perhaps the problem here is not\nwith the theory of mnemonic evidence that the the temporally local\ntheories hold, but with evidentialism. Perhaps, that is, this is a case\nwhere we should say that Sati and Joe have the same evidence, but that\nthis evidence supports different beliefs given the different reliability\nof their memories.\n\nBut there is little to be said to motivate such a theory. If we aren't\ngoing to be evidentialists, it isn't clear what the relevance of a\ntheory of evidence is. And if we are going to say that historical\nevents, like the fact that Joe's memories were wiped and Sati's weren't,\nare relevant to contemporary rationality, it isn't clear what we gain by\nhaving a temporally local theory of evidence. Either way, we have said\nthat the existence of past events is relevant to the rationality of\ncurrent beliefs. At this point we aren't engaged in much more than a\nterminological dispute with the temporally extended theories.\n\n## Against Indirect Theory {#againstindirecttheory}\n\nAs Matthias @Steup2013 argues, the indirect theory of memory is\nimplausible. It says that when one remembers that, say, the Chicago\nWhite Sox won the 2005 World Series, there are two things that are\nneeded in order to ground the rational belief. The first is the apparent\nmemory, and the second is some kind of reason to think that the memories\nare reliable. But the only reasons we could have for believing the\nsecond comes from what we have learned about the track record of memory,\nor perhaps of the role of memory in human functioning. And we couldn't\nbe rational in believing those things unless we could rationally rely on\nmemory in forming beliefs. So we can never rationally form any belief on\nthe basis of memory unless we antecedently have reason to trust memory.\nAnd that, plus the indirect theory of memory, leads to a vicious\nregress, and hence to an implausible scepticism.\n\nThe argument here is similar in form to an argument that has often been\nlevelled against the indirect theory of testimony. This argument traces\nback at least to @Coady1995. The argument is that children can rely on\ntestimony to get knowledge, and hence rational belief, but they don't\nhave the information or the cognitive capacity to rationally judge who\nis and isn't reliable. So it can't be, contra the indirect theorist,\nthat such judgments of reliability are required in order to get rational\nbelief and knowledge from testimony.\n\nOne problem with such an argument in the case of testimony is that it\nhas relied, historically, on a very impoverished view of the cognitive\ncapacities of young children. It is true that the capacity shown for\nexplicit reasoning by children is often very weak. But they have rather\namazing capacities for implicit reasoning, and there isn't any reason to\nthink they could not judge and track reliability of informants.[^3]\n\nThe issue here is not capacity, it is information. No matter how much\ncapacity you have, you can't make rational judgments about the\nreliability of memory without information about memory. And you can't\nhave that information without being able to use memory. That's the key\nproblem.\n\nWe can use this idea to strengthen the arguments in the previous section\nabout Sati. If the indirect theory of memory is wrong, we have to be a\nbit careful about why Hugh can't know he came by the mountain path. It\ncan't just be that he lacks a reason to think his memories are reliable.\nRather, it must be that what he was told at the bottom of the mountain\nis a reason to think his memories are not reliable. It must be the\npresence of reasons to doubt memory, not the absence of reasons to\ntrust, that is doing the work.\n\nAnd, as noted, this is a big difference between Hugh's case and Sati's.\nSati does not have any positive reason to doubt her memory. She is\nseveral steps removed from the situation where her memories would be in\ndoubt. It's true that her mnemonic beliefs are insensitive to the truth\nin a certain way. Arguably, the nearest world in which she came to\nShangri La by the sea is one where she still believes she came by the\nmountains. But any kind of defeasible, direct theory of memory will\nallow for some rational but insensitive belief.\n\nAssume that our theory says that *S* can rationally use her memory to\nbelieve that *p* unless defeaters *D* are triggered. And *S* uses her\nmemory to (accurately) remember $\\neg D$. That is, she remembers that\nshe is not in a situation where those defeaters are triggered.\nPresumably if *D* were true, her memory would be unreliable; that's what\nmakes *D* a defeater. So there isn't any reason to think that this\nmnemonic belief in $\\neg D$ is sensitive; she may well still have had it\nwere *D* true. But the direct theory implies this doesn't matter, and\nthe direct theory is the only theory on the table given that the\nindirect theory leads to implausible scepticism.\n\nCould it be that Sati should not trust her memory because she is, and\nshe knows she is, in a class of people whose memories are unreliable?\nWell, the mere fact that she is in such a class is not interesting. She\nknows, after all she is a member of the class consisting of her and all\npeople with unreliable memories, and the memories of that class are as a\ngroup unreliable. But that's not a reason to distrust her memory. Or, at\nleast, it can't be on pain of scepticism. What must matter is that she\nis in such a class, and it is epistemologically significant. But the\nsignificant class around here seems to be the class of people whose\nmemories have been erased, or who have reason to suspect their memories\nhave been erased. And that doesn't include Sati. She knows she likes\nVegemite, and has for a long time, and she knows that only\nMarmite-likers in Shangri La had their memories erased.\n\nHere's what is true of Sati. She is, right now, phenomenally\nindistinguishable from a possible person whose memories are unreliable.\nBut why should that matter? We all know brain in vat cases are possible,\nand each of us is phenomenally indistinguishable from such an unreliable\n'person'. But that isn't on its own grounds for doubt about memory. All\nthat she learns from the attendant is that another kind of brain in vat\ncase is possible. But she knew they were possible all along. The case\nisn't actual and, unless we come up with a trigger for the defeater in\nthe theory of memory, she has no reason to think it is actual.\n\n## Argument from A Priority {#argumentfromapriority}\n\nThere is another argument against the temporally local theories, and\nagainst both the direct and indirect theories, that we can derive from\nthe work of Tyler @Burge1993 [@Burge1997]. (I should note that there is\nconsiderable dispute about how best to interpret Burge. I'm not claiming\nthat what follows is the best interpretation, or the only\ninterpretation, just that it is an interesting argument inspired by, and\nquite arguably contained in, his work.)\n\nTamati is doing a proof. At one stage in the proof he appeals to\nFermat's Little Theorem, which says for any natural number $n$, and any\nprime $p$, $n^p \\equiv n \\text{ (mod } p)$. Using this theorem, Tamati\ncompletes his proof, and derives a nice result $M$. Intuitively, Tamati\nhas not just come to know $M$, but he has come to know $M$ a priori.\n\nBut assume, now, that either kind of temporally local theory is true. At\none stage of the proof, Tamati had to, at least implicitly, reason as\nfollows. It seems to me that I remember that\n$n^p \\equiv n \\text{ (mod } p)$, so (perhaps with an extra premise),\n$n^p \\equiv n \\text{ (mod } p)$. And that can't be a priori reasoning,\nsince the premise about how things seem to Tamati is contingent and a\nposteriori. If the indirect theory of memory is right, the extra premise\nneeded about the reliability of Tamati's memory will also be contingent\nand a posteriori.\n\nIt would be a very strange and revisionary theory of the a priori to say\nthat any proof is not a priori if it relies on remembered theorems\nwithout, perhaps, memory of the proof of that theorem. The proof of\nFermat's Little Theorem isn't difficult, but it does go through several\nsteps. It is hard to keep the whole proof in mind at once. Even proving\nit, that is, requires a little memory. On the temporally local theory,\nit isn't clear that it could ever be a priori knowable for any normal\nperson. And any theorem that required using it would similarly be a\nposteriori.\n\nPerhaps it could be said that Tamati's reasoning is a priori because it\ndoesn't rely on sense perception, only on perception of how things seem\nto Tamati. But some such perception of how things seem yields a\nposteriori knowledge. If Tamati has a headache, and notices this at the\nsame time he remembers Fermat's Little Theorem, he gets a posteriori\nknowledge of the contingent truth that he has a headache, and a priori\nknowledge of the necessary truth of the theorem.\n\nIn short, a transmissive theory of memory is required to get the result\nthat Tamati gets a priori knowledge of the mathematical theorem. As\nBurge argues, a transmissive theory of testimony gets the exciting\nresult that when Tamati goes on to tell his friend about $M$, the friend\ngets a priori knowledge of $M$ as well. If one thinks it is intuitive\nthat the friend's knowledge is a priori, that's a good reason to favour\na transmissive view of testimony. But that the friend's knowledge is a\npriori is not as intuitively obvious as that Tamati's knowledge is a\npriori, so it isn't obvious we must treat memory and testimony the same\nway here.\n\nI'll end this section with a note about the dialectic. What would the\nargument of the paper lose if the arguments of this section didn't work?\nThis is an important question because of arguments, such as those by\nDaniele @Sgaravatti2012 [Ch. 3], that the a priori/a posteriori\ndistinction can't do the epistemological work that it is traditionally\ntaken to do. The answer is that we'd lose one of the best arguments\nagainst the direct version of the temporally local theory, while the\nargument against the indirect version would not be significantly\naffected.\n\nAssume for now that one is happy with Tamati's knowledge, and indeed all\nnon-trivial mathematical knowledge, being a posteriori in this way,\nbecause it relies on mnemonic knowledge about one's earlier self. There\nis still the question of how one gets from this knowledge about one's\nearlier self to knowledge of mathematics. On this indirect theory, this\ngoes via reasoning about the reliability of one's earlier self. But that\nreasoning will have to use some non-trivial mathematics, and we'll be\nback in the kind of circle we warned about in the previous section. On\nthe direct theory, this won't be a problem, since there isn't any\nchallenge in getting from *I have an apparent memory that p* to *p*.\nThat inference is perfectly sound, as long as one lacks reasons to\ndistrust it. It is still, I think, puzzling that we have to analyse\nmathematicians as reasoning this way, and generating a posteriori\nknowledge. But they key dialectical point is that sense of puzzlement is\nonly relevant to thinking about the direct version of the temporally\nlocal theory; the indirect version is beset by a host of further and\nmore serious problems.\n\n## Argument from Laundering {#argumentfromlaundering}\n\nThe arguments involving Sati and Tamati were designed to show that not\nall rational mnemonic belief relies on inference from the existence of a\ncurrent mnemonic seeming. But neither argument suggested that there was\nanything wrong with such inferences. It is fully compatible with what I\nsaid about both Sati and Tamati that they could also try to infer from\nhow things seem to them to facts about how they got to Shangri La, or\nabout modular arithmetic.\n\nBarnett's argument for a temporally extended view takes the opposite\ntack. He thinks there is something problematic about these inferences,\nor at least a special class of them. And because of this, he infers that\nthe inference from present seeming can't be explanatorily important. And\nthat gets him to a version of a temporally extended theory.\n\nSo what's the problem? Here's the schematic case that he focusses on.\n\n> Two Beliefs\n>\n> :   On Monday you came to believe that $p$ for good reasons that\n>     justified your belief, and on Tuesday you came to believe that $q$\n>     for bad reasons that failed to justify it (where $p$ and $q$ are\n>     independent). It is now Wednesday, and you have forgotten nothing,\n>     reconsidered nothing, and learned no new relevant evidence. You\n>     recall each conclusion without occurrently recalling your original\n>     reasons for those conclusions.  [@Barnett2015 15]\n\nAgain, it's a bit of an annoyance to use 'you', especially since you,\ndear reader, would not do anything so foolhardy as come to believe $q$.\nSo let's assume Barnett's narration is directed at Kim. And the question\nis, is Kim's belief that $q$, on Wednesday, rational? Assume, to make\nthe case most interesting, that this mistaken inference to $q$ is\ncompletely out of character. Kim is, and knows he is, a very reliable\nprocessor of information, who rarely makes this kind of mistake.\n\nThe worry is that any temporally local theory will say that Kim's belief\non Wednesday is rational. After all, Kim has an apparent belief that\n$q$, and not only lacks evidence of his unreliability, but knows he is\nreliable. Great! But, intuitively, his belief doesn't go from being\nirrational to being rational just by the passage of time. It can't get\nits irrationality laundered out in this way.\n\nBut it isn't clear how big a problem this really should be. Note that\nKim is supposed to have forgotten nothing. So the evidence on which $q$\nwas based is still there. Now allow the temporally local theory a\nprinciple that they should want on independent grounds. That principle\nis that evidence screens judgment; the evidential force of the fact that\nan agent made a judgment is completely screened, for that agent, by the\nevidence the judgment was based on.[^4] I just stated that principle\nsychronically, so it doesn't immediately have implications for Kim's\ncase. But it is plausible to say that as long as the judgment remains,\nits evidential force is screened off by the evidence it was based on.\n\nNow whether one has a direct or indirect theory, Kim is not obviously\ncompelled to hold on to her belief that $q$. And whether or not one\nbelieves the screening principle, the fact that Kim has forgotten\nnothing means that there is no symmetry between the cases of $p$ and\n$q$. The relevant evidence is different in the two cases. The only\ntheorist who has a challenge here is one who thinks that only occurrent\nstates are evidence, and that is a particularly implausible addition to\nthe indirect theory.\n\nBarnett's case is different in a couple of respects than an example\nGilbert @Harman1986 [Ch. 4] uses to draw rather different conclusions.\nWorking through the differences between them allows us to see something\ninteresting about rational dilemmas, even if it isn't immediately\nrelevant to the debates about memory.\n\nIn Harman's example, Karen first draws a conclusion $q$. This is\nactually rational for her to draw given her evidence, but her evidence\nwas extremely misleading. She then forgets why she came to believe $q$,\nand gets new evidence that would show her the old evidence was\nmisleading. But since she doesn't remember why she believed $q$, she\ndoesn't know that this new evidence affects her grounds for belief in\n$q$, and retains the belief.\n\nHarman says that this is rational. Karen isn't required to keep track of\nher evidence for each thing she believes. That seems right. It is hardly\na rational failing of mine to not remember precisely why I think that\nthe White Sox won the 2005 World Series; I don't need to keep that level\nof detail in mind. And if Karen does not do that, she can't be expected\nto adjust her beliefs when the evidence that, unbeknownst to her, they\nare based on is undermined.\n\nHarman thinks that our original intuition about Karen's case is that her\nbelief in $q$ is irrational once it has been undermined. But he also\nthinks reflection on real life cases like Karen's shows this intuition\nto be mistaken. The lesson he draws from this is that something like the\ndirect theory is right; Karen can trust her memories unless she has a\nspecial reason to doubt them, even if in fact she couldn't put together\na positive argument for their reliability.\n\nBarnett's case of Kim is different than Harman's case of Karen in two\nrespects. Kim retains his evidence; Karen loses hers. And Kim makes an\nirrational mistake; Karen is rationally misled by misleading evidence.\nAre those differences enough to think we should treat the cases\ndifferently? Or should we be worried that Karen's case, like perhaps\nKim's, is one where intuition is not a reliable guide?\n\nI don't actually have a firm view on this. The differences are\nsignificant. Harman himself thinks that the intuition in Karen's case is\ndriven by the mistaken assumption that Karen will track and retain her\nevidence. That's not true in normal cases like Karen's. But it is true,\nby stipulation, in Kim's. So that is one big reason for treating the\ncases differently. Still, I do worry a little that we're drifting into\nareas where intuition is unreliable.\n\nTo make that worry a little more concrete, consider this argument for\nthe conclusion that Kim's belief in $q$ is actually rational.\n\n1.  It would be irrational for Kim to re-open inquiry into whether $q$,\n    given that it was settled, and no new evidence has come in.\n\n2.  It would be irrational or impossible for Kim to intentionally forget\n    $q$.\n\n3.  Kim cannot change his attitude to $q$ without either re-opening\n    inquiry into whether $q$, or by forgetting $q$.\n\n4.  There is some rational attitude towards $q$ that Kim can take.\n\n5.  So, Kim is rational to retain belief in $q$, since any other\n    possible path would involve irrationality of some kind.\n\nPremises 2 and 3 aren't, I think, particularly controversial, especially\nif 'inquiry' is read so broadly that any re-evaluation of $q$ counts as\nre-opening inquiry. The issues are premises 1 and 4. Premise 4 is a no\ndilemmas principle. We'll return to it later, though in this context it\nis notable that Barnett himself endorses it, as do many other\nepistemologists.  [@Barnett2015 10]\n\nThe big issue is premise 1. I think it is true. It is a mistake to go\naround constantly reconsidering things that one has settled. Once a\ndecision has been reached, it should be held, unless a reason comes\nalong to reconsider it. That reason may be evidence that the decision\nwas faulty, or reason to think the decision was badly made. But the mere\npassage of time is not a reason to reconsider, and nor is the fact that\nif inquiry were (properly) conducted, it would yield a different\nconclusion.\n\nThe picture I'm putting forward here owes a lot to Richard @Holton1999\n[@Holton2009; @Holton2014], as well as to a related idea due to Crispin\n@Wright2004. Holton argues that if one has an intention, rationality\nrequires one to maintain that unless a good reason comes along to\nreconsider it. The fact that one would not form the intention again were\none to reconsider it is not, he thinks, itself a good reason.\nStrikingly, he says that even in Kavka's toxin puzzle  [@Kavka1983], the\nagent who intends to drink the toxin should not reconsider, because they\nhave no reason to do so.  [@Holton2009 162--5]. And he suggests that we\nshould think of belief along similar lines  [@Holton2014]. To believe\nsomething is to commit to its truth, and we need a positive reason to\ngive up our commitments. Wright argues that the sceptic tries to lure us\ninto opening inquiries we can tell will not be completed. We should\nresist the lure. We have no reason to open the broad ranging inquiry\ninto our own competencies that the sceptic wants us to hold, and good\nreason to avoid it.[^5]\n\nWe can perhaps motivate the application of these ideas to cases like\nKim's by thinking of a similar case involving action.\n\n> Ned has been thinking about buying a new bed. He is deciding between a\n> wood bed and a metal bed. And he just decided to get the wood bed.\n> This is a bad mistake. He will like the metal bed much better, and\n> this is in fact clear from the evidence available to Ned. But he's\n> made up his mind. The wood bed store is five miles east, the metal bed\n> store is five miles west. And there's Ned in his car, driving\n> eastward. What does rationality require of Ned now?\n\nI think Ned's in a rational dilemma. It is irrational to drive to the\nwood bed store and buy a wood bed. He won't like it, and it is\npredictable that he won't. What a mistake. But it is irrational to\nreopen inquiry. He's made up his mind, and now he should focus on the\nroad. He hasn't received any new evidence about the qualities of the\nbed, or any reason to think he mis-evaluated the old evidence. And we\ncan't go around second guessing our past decisions all the time. That\nincludes those of us (presumably all of us) who make mistakes. It is\nirrational to be fickle.\n\nSo what can Ned rationally do? The arguments of the previous paragraph\nsuggest he's in a rational dilemma. If you want to act rationally, you\nshouldn't start where Ned is. If he keeps driving to the wood bed store,\nhe'll irrationally buy a sub-optimal bed. If he thinks again about the\nissue, he'll be irrationally fickle. Rationality requires something that\nis practically impossible; changing his mind about what to buy without\nre-opening the issue of what to buy.\n\nThis is a dilemma for Ned, but it is one he could have avoided. He could\nhave not made the mistaken decision in the first place. It may or may\nnot be unfair if rationality makes incompatible demands on an agent\nwithout any chance to avoid them. But it isn't unfair to think that\nagents who make mistakes at $t_1$ are, in virtue of those mistakes, left\nwithout any good options at $t_2$. Mistakes have consequences.\n\nIs this inconsistent with evidentialism? I said above that evidentialism\nsays the rational status of a belief supervenes on the evidence that the\nagent has. Yet now I'm saying Ned is irrational to change his mind. But\nif he had, with the very same evidence, believed that he should get the\nmetal bed, that would have been rational. This looks like a\ncounterexample to evidentialism.\n\nHere's why it isn't a counterexample. What is irrational for Ned is\nre-opening inquiry into what bed to get. It is the activity of engaging\nin further consideration of the question that it is irrational.\nMoreover, this is irrational because the evidence that is available to\nmake this decision does not support it. Should Ned irrationally engage\nin this activity, there is a uniquely rational way to finish it, which\nis to change his mind. But that's not the same as saying that he should,\nrationally, change his mind.\n\nI am making a big assumption here, but one I think is true. Careful\nconsideration involves thinking through a large amount of evidence.\nDecisions to engage in careful consideration must be made on the basis\nof flimsier amounts of evidence. After all, to bring all the evidence\none has to bear on a question is to engage in careful consideration. So\na decision to engage in such consideration must not use all that\nevidence. So evidentialism must say that the rationality of a belief,\ncredence, decision etc must depend on, i.e., supervene on, the evidence\navailable to the agent when they make that decision. And when deciding\nwhether to carefully consider or reflect on the evidence, very little is\navailable.\n\nThat's why I think Ned isn't a counterexample to evidentialism. And nor\nis Kim a counterexample to evidentialism, even if there is no way she\ncan rationally lose her belief in *q*. For Kim too faces a dilemma, of\njust the same kind. So the argument I gave for the rationality of Kim's\ncontinuing to believe *q* goes wrong at step 4. Kim has gotten herself\ninto a mess, and there are no rational ways out.\n\nBut note that last conclusion cuts across the theories of memory we've\nconsidered here. The temporally extended theory has, as its distinctive\nclaim, that some agents have a kind of evidence that the temporally\nlocal theory says no agent has. But Kim is not one of those agents. The\nevidence in question is evidence one gets when one acquires a piece of\nknowledge, and keeps that token mental state across time. And the\nrelevant fact about Kim is that he has a belief in $q$ that is well and\ntruly not a piece of knowledge. So it doesn't look like the case should\ntell the local and extended theories apart.\n\nWhat it does so is show that there is a new kind of argument for the\npossibility of rational dilemmas. People make mistakes. When they do,\nthere might be no good way to undo the effect of the mistake. And then\nthey're in a dilemma. We don't avoid that conclusion by giving people\nwho don't make mistakes more evidence.\n\n## Conclusion and Future Research {#conclusionandfutureresearch}\n\nI've argued for a transmissive, temporally extended, view of memory and\nthe evidence it provides. When I remember that the White Sox won in\n2005, it is the fact that they won which is my evidence, not my apparent\nmemory. The role of memory is to preserve this fact in evidence, not to\ngive me new evidence for it. Saying this invites any number of\nquestions. I'll end with a list of several ones that I find fascinating,\nbut which I'm a long way from having answers to, divided up loosely into\nquestions about metaphysics, and questions about epistemology.\n\n### Preservation\n\nWhat is it for memory to preserve a belief? Sven @Bernecker2008 has\nwritten on this at length, and the issue turns out to be much more\ncomplicated than we might first suspect. I'm particularly unsure about\ncases like this one,\n\n> Ankati.\n>\n> :   I haven't had to change planes at O'Hare for over five years. That\n>     makes me happy.\n>\n> Bojan.\n>\n> :   Are you sure? What about the trip to Vancouver? Or the one to Hong\n>     Kong?\n>\n> Ankati.\n>\n> :   Vancouver was a direct flight. And I went to Hong Kong via New\n>     York. But, oh, you're right, I came back via O'Hare. Sad face.\n\nAt the end Ankati remembers that she flew home from Hong Kong via\nO'Hare. Is this a belief that was stored in memory ever since it\nhappened? If so, we have to say that Ankati had inconsistent beliefs at\nthe start of the conversation. If not, then I think it is hard to say\nthat the relevant evidence for the belief that saddens her is the fact\nthat she transferred at O'Hare. In such a case, it seems to me that the\ntemporally local theory is more plausible than in more usual cases.\n\n### Initial Evidence and Over-Riding {#initialevidenceandover-riding}\n\nThe following two questions are related:\n\n-   What past states can constitute present evidence?\n\n-   What present states can over-ride, or defeat, past evidence?\n\nMy instinct is to defend an extremely restricted answer to this pair of\nquestions. In particular, $S$'s attitude towards $p$ at $t_1$ can only\nbe evidence for her at $t_2$ if the following conditions obtain.\n\n1.  $S$ knows that $p$ at $t_1$.\n\n2.  $S$ does not receive a significant amount of evidence against $p$\n    between $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n\n3.  $S$ does not receive (undefeated) reasons to distrust her ability to\n    preserve information between $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n\nBut every one of these points is problematic.\n\nThe first point might imply some counterintuitive things about people\nwho trust misleading evidence, such as 'Karen' in the earlier cited\nexample by Gilbert @Harman1986 [Ch. 4]. Let's focus on an even simpler\ncase than Harman's. Unlike me, my doppleganger Nairb believes that the\nAstros beat the White Sox in the 2005 World Series. That's because his\nweb browser had been hacked on that crucial October morning, and it\nreported the wrong results. He hasn't seen any relevant evidence since.\nHe has forgotten why he thinks the Astros won in 2005, but has held on\nto the belief. Is this belief rational, and what's his evidence for it?\n\nThe evidence can't be that the Astros won in 2005; they didn't. And it\ncan't be that his computer reported that; he's forgotten that fact.\nLet's say that it is his apparent memory that they won, which seems to\nbe the only remaining option. That would mean that the rationality of\nhis forming the belief in the first place is independent of whether his\ncurrent belief that the Astros won is rational. That's better than the\nalternative options, but it isn't particularly happy either.\n\nThe second point leads us into the version of the dogmatism puzzle that\nMaria @Lasonen-Aarnio2014a has developed. Assume that significant\nevidence can factor into insignificant parts. Pazu knows that $p$, then\ngets three pieces of evidence $e_1, e_2$ and $e_3$ that tell against\n$p$. The conjunction is significant evidence, the individual parts are\nnot. But the parts come in sequentially. When $e_1$ comes in, Pazu still\nknows $p$; after all, it is insignificant evidence. So Pazu can\nconclude, i.e., know, that it is misleading evidence. And, intuitively,\nwe can ignore evidence we know to be misleading. So he ignores $e_1$.\nAnd for similar reasons he ignores $e_2$. Then $e_3$ comes in. Should he\nstill ignore it? Presumably; it is on its own insignificant, and the\nonly other evidence was known to be misleading, and so ignored. But it\nis odd that Pazu can hold onto his knowledge in $p$ in the face of these\nthree pieces of evidence, while he would have lost knowledge had they\ncome in at once.\n\nFinally, we need to explain why evidence of unreliability of mnemonic\nprocesses can block mnemonic knowledge. If memory was a source of\nevidence, rather than a preserver of evidence, that would be an easy\nproblem. In general, a source does not provide evidence to an agent if\nthe agent has reason to believe that it is unreliable. The problem is\nhow to motivate an extension of that principle to memory, which is in\ngeneral not a source of evidence, but a preserver of it.\n\nWe could simply insist that the Shangri La case shows that the\npreservative role of memory can be defeated given sufficient grounds to\ndoubt its accuracy. I think that's right, we can insist that. But there\nis a puzzle still about why this should be so. And that puzzle remains\nwork for another day, as do the other puzzles in this section.\n\n### Externalism\n\nFinally, there are some tantalising possibilities for new angles into\nfamiliar epistemological debates between internalists and externalists.\nIt is hardly news that this is possible; Goldman's 'problem of forgotten\nevidence' is a familiar challenge to (certain) internalists\n [@Goldman1999]. But there might be other ways to make memory relevant\nto familiar debates.\n\nIf the temporally extended theory is true, then what is rational depends\non something that is, well, extended. And if what is rational depends on\nsomething that is extended in time, we might think it is less surprising\nthat is also depends on something that is extended in space. And that\nsuggests the way to a kind of externalism.\n\nWe can do a bit better than that hand-waving metaphor though. There are\nversions of the New Evil Demon problem for transmissivism. If\ntransmissivism is true anyway, that means those problems have solutions.\nThen we just have to find what those solutions are, and see if they\ngeneralise to solutions to the spatial version of the New Evil Demon\nproblem. And if they do, we might have new ways to defend externalist\ntheories of rationality, or at least new motivations for familiar ways\nto defend those theories.\n\n[^1]: As with the transmissive view on testimony, I don't take it to be\n    essential to the transmissive view that all mnemonic knowledge is\n    transmitted. Perhaps, as @Lackey2005 argues, memory can sometimes\n    generate new knowledge. Even so, as long as it sometimes plays a\n    purely preservative role, the transmissive theory is true.\n\n[^2]: Michael @Dummett1994 also defends a transmissive account of\n    memory, though the analogy between testimony and memory is important\n    in his argument. Jérôme @Dokic2001 endorses Dummett's position on\n    memory.\n\n[^3]: On children's capacities to learn, see @Saffran1996b\n    [@Saffran1996a] and @Gopnik2001. For applications of this directly\n    to the judgments of credibility, see among many others,\n    @KoenigClementHarris2004 and @HarrisCorriveau2011. @Jaswal2008 show\n    that children don't just track credibility of informants, they trade\n    off credibility of informant against credibility of what is\n    currently being said. In general, the lesson from the last 10 to 20\n    years of research is that children have more than enough capacity to\n    perform the cognitive tasks that indirect theorists require of them.\n\n[^4]: I haven't actually defended this in print yet, but it is correctly\n    attributed to me by Sophie @Horowitz2013 [25].\n\n[^5]: Sue @Hamilton2001 [78] says that this idea, that it is wrong to\n    open an inquiry you know you can't complete, plays a central role in\n    the epistemology of the important Nyāya philosopher Gotama. The\n    discussion of forecasting in @Tetlock2015 might cast doubt on\n    whether the kind of conservatism I'm endorsing here is empirically\n    sound. There is a suggestion there that people who tinker with their\n    credal states more frequently end up with more accurate credences.\n    This is a topic that deserves revisiting as more data comes in.\n",
