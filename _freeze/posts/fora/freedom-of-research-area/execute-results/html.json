I argue against this: it is consistent with academic freedom for universities to hire people to research particular subjects, and to make continued employment conditional on at least some of the academic’s research being in the areas they were hired to work in. In practice, many academics think that their fellow academics should be free to choose to work on anything that’s within the disciplinary boundaries of the department they were hired into. I argue that’s both too narrow and too broad. Academic freedom implies that researchers should be allowed to have their research focus drift over time. But the boundaries of permissible drift do not correspond to anything like the boundaries of contemporary academic departments.\ndate: December 25 2018\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1093/oso/9780198791508.003.0006\"\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198791508.003.0006\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: mcad.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nImagine that a young designer gets hired by Uber. The company has\ndecided that their smartphone logo is terrible, and it needs to be\nreplaced. And rather than using a design agency, they think they can do\na better job in house. So they get a designer. And the new employee is,\nin a sense, really good. They aren't really good at designing logos; in\nfact they don't make any progress on the logo at all. But they are\nreally good at researching the history of transportation regulation, and\nwriting about this history in a crisp and timely manner. After a while,\nthey spend all their time on this historical research and writing, and\nthe new logo languishes.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Academic Freedom_, edited by Jennifer Lackey, Oxford 102-115.\n\nPicture by [MCAD Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/69184488@N06) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/ac3b8ca0-01b9-46e7-8f9e-63dcdfe39007).\n</aside>\n\nI haven't worked for Uber, or any company like much like them, so I\ncan't say for sure what would happen. But my impression is that the new\nemployee would find themselves fired rather promptly. It wouldn't matter\nhow good their work was. In fact, I stipulated that it was good. And it\nwouldn't matter how important that work was to the overall mission of\nthe company. I don't know Uber's inner workings, but from the outside I\nsuspect that anything that can help them deal with regulatory challenges\nis considerably more important to their long-term profitability than the\nlook of their smartphone icon. None of this matters. The employee was\nhired to do a job, they were conspicuously not doing it, and in many\nbusinesses, that will mean you get fired.\n\nAcademia is, in crucial respects, not like that. Indeed, it is a key\naspect of academic freedom that researchers get a rather large degree of\nfreedom in choosing what they want to work on. A department may conduct\na search in a very specialised area, and hire someone on the strength of\ntheir work in just that area, but if that person conducts research in a\nsomewhat different area when they arrive at the job, there is little the\ndepartment can do about it. And, some say, this is how things should be.\nAnything otherwise, they say, would be an unacceptable restriction on\nacademic freedom. Here, for instance, is how Cary Nelson puts the point,\n\n> Academic freedom gives both students and faculty the right to study\n> and do research on the topics they choose and to draw what conclusions\n> they find consistent with their research, though it does not prevent\n> others from judging whether their work is valuable and their\n> conclusions sound. [@Nelson2010]\n\nThe idea that academics are not constrained in their research topics has\nsome history. Here is Alexander Bickel, describing an ideal university.\n\n> In universities, professionals of many disciplines can follow lines of\n> inquiry determined by themselves, individually and collectively, and\n> dictated by no one else, on grounds either ideological or practical.\n>  [@Bickel1975 127]\n\nAnd we see something similar in some university regulations. Here, for\nexample, is what the University of Chicago has to say about research\ntopics.\n\n> The basic policies of The University of Chicago include complete\n> freedom of research and the unrestricted dissemination of\n> information.[^1]\n\nThere is a principle that seems to be running through these quotes, and\nthat I mean to focus on here. I'll call it FRA.\n\nFreedom of Research Area (FRA)\n\n:   If part of an academic's job involves doing research, then the\n    academic themselves gets to choose which areas they shall perform\n    that research in. And provided solely that the quality of the work\n    is sufficiently high, this research in their self-chosen area shall\n    count as adequately discharging their duties to their academic\n    employer, at least as they pertain to research.\n\nI think FRA is false, or at least that it should be false. That is, I\nthink academics should not have complete free choice of what they\nresearch on. I'm not really sure how many people think FRA is true,\nthough I probably some people think something like it is true. Perhaps\nmore importantly, I think the appropriate qualifications that one needs\nto add to FRA to make it true are neither obvious, nor reflected in\npractice. And that's why I think it's worth discussing.\n\nIn particular, while FRA does not seem to me to be reflected in the\nregular practice of academic life, a related principle I'll call FRAD\nis. That is, I think FRAD is both widely believed, and many people act\nas if it is true.\n\nFreedom of Research Area within Department (FRAD)\n\n:   If part of an academic's job involves doing research, then the\n    academic themselves gets to choose which areas they shall perform\n    that research in, provided it is within the disciplinary boundaries\n    of their home department. And provided solely that the quality of\n    the work is sufficiently high, and that they work within these\n    disciplinary boundaries, this research in their self-chosen area\n    shall count as adequately discharging their duties to their academic\n    employer, at least as they pertain to research.\n\nFRAD, I'll argue, is also false. Something close to FRAD, however, is\ntrue. Academics should have 'elbow room' in their research; they should\nbe able to move from one research project to nearby projects. And if\nthey make such a move, they should count as having fulfilled their\nresearch responsibilities provided their research is of a high enough\nquality. FRAD is similar to the elbow room thesis, but not quite the\nsame as it. And the differences matter in some important cases.\n\nIn focussing on FRA and FRAD, I'm setting to one side most of the\nquestions usually thought central to debates about academic freedom.\n(Though I trust these questions will get plenty of discussion in the\nrest of this volume.) The focus here is on which questions academics\nask, not on what answers they give. Questions about how free academics\nshould be in answering questions (E.g., Is it ok to defend Pol Pot? Is\nit ok to use seances to motivate historical interpretations?) are left\nfor others to address. And I'm exclusively focussing on what academics\ndo in the conduct of their work. Questions about whether they should be\nsubject to professional sanction for research activities outside work,\nand, assuming they are immune from such sanction, whether this immunity\nought be related to their status as academics or simply to their status\nas employees are also being set aside.\n\nSo we're focussed on what questions academics ask in the course of their\nwork as academics. There is one more distinction to make to really focus\nthe discussion. Academics have, to greater or lesser extents, both the\nfreedom to tackle different research topics, and the responsibility to\ntackle certain topics. I'm interested in the responsibility side. What\nkind of research counts as suitably discharging one's professional\nresponsibility to research? Put more bluntly, the focus here is not on\nwhat research questions an academic may ask, but on what questions they\nmust ask.\n\nThe American academy has a rather odd structure when in comes to\nenforcing this responsibility. Junior academics get reviewed after\nroughly six years, and if their performance is satisfactory, they are\nawarded tenure. If not, they are fired. Just what counts for tenure\nvaries a lot between institutions, but at research institutions, whether\none has adequately discharged one's research responsibilities is a huge\npart of the equation.\n\nIt's not completely true that there is no other point in the American\nacademic's career where there will be an inquiry into how well they are\ndischarging their research responsibilities. But at no other point are\nthe stakes nearly as high. For instance, many departments have a small\npot of money to distribute in the form of annual raises each year, and\noften enough research performance is a factor in that distribution. But\nthe sums involved, especially in cash-strapped times, are tiny. Since it\nis very rare for one's nominal salary to fall in this process, and\ninflation is so low, the worst that happens if one completely fails to\ndischarge all research responsibilities is that one's salary falls by a\npercent or so per year. That can add up over time, but compared to being\nfired, it's a minor penalty.\n\nSo I'm going to focus mostly on that tenure decision here. That isn't\nbecause I have any sympathy for the current structure, with the stakes\nbeing so high here and so low elsewhere. But it's what we have to work\nwith, so it's what is relevant here and now.[^2]\n\nSo imagine the following case. A young scholar gets hired in a US\nuniversity[^3] on a tenure-track line. Six years later, they are up for\ntenure review. And in the interim they have done high quality work, with\nthe quality and quantity of the work being sufficient for promotion to\ntenure. But the work is in a different area to the work they did before\nbeing hired, and this work is not at all what the department had in mind\nwhen they were hired. Assuming their promotion file is adequate in other\nrespects (especially concerning teaching and service), should they be\npromoted to tenure? Or, perhaps more precisely, what further details of\nthe case matter to whether they should be promoted to tenure? Should it\nmatter, for instance, whether the work was inside or outside the\ndisciplinary purview of the department?\n\nI'm assuming here that principles of academic freedom apply at all to\npre-tenured faculty. This doesn't seem too controversial, though it is\nstriking how some universities talk about tenure and academic freedom.\nHere, for instance, is a passage from the University of Michigan's\nTenure Guidelines:\n\n> The University safeguards academic freedom through its policy that no\n> person who has been awarded tenure by the Regents or who has been\n> employed by the University for a total of ten years at the rank of a\n> full-time instructor or higher may, thereafter, be dismissed, demoted\n> or recommended for terminal appointment without adequate cause and an\n> opportunity for a review...  [@MichTenureA]\n\nIt isn't hard to read that as saying that it is through tenure that\nacademic freedom is protected, and conclude from that that faculty\nwithout tenure don't have academic freedom. But I'm assuming that\nconclusion is false; academic freedom does extend to untenured faculty.\nAnd the question is what it covers.\n\nThe particular puzzle case I'm interested in is not unique to\nphilosophy, but philosophy is considerably more prone to it than other\nfields. In many fields, a central part of the tenure file consists of\nthe book that results from the dissertation. In such cases, there is\nlittle danger that the tenure file will look radically different from\nthe research profile that was submitted in the candidate's original job\napplication. In many other fields, research is closely connected to\ngetting and spending grant money. And the mechanics of grants make it\nhard for someone's research to take a sharp change of direction at a\nvery early stage of their career. This is not to say the case I'm\ninterested in cannot arise in such disciplines. But it is much more\nlikely to arise in disciplines that are neither grant-based nor\nbook-based. There are few such disciplines in existence right now, but\nphilosophy, at least in the US, is one. Philosophy is also the\ndiscipline I know the most about and, to be honest, care the most about,\nso it doesn't bother me that I'm writing about a problem that is more\ncommon here than elsewhere.\n\nI'm also going to write exclusively about fictional cases. I looked into\nusing some real life cases to make the discussion more vivid. But they\nended up being more of a distraction than a helpful illustration. In\nparticular, it was hard to find a case where a candidate for tenure was\nuncontroversially doing high quality work, but there were concerns about\nthe area it was in. Rather than re-litigating the tenure files of these\nhuman beings, I think it most appropriate to focus here on the abstract\ncase.[^4]\n\nTo be sure, it is hard to precisely imagine a case just like the one I\nam describing. Doing high level research in any field is hard. If there\nis no sign of one having worked on something before being hired, the\nprobability that one will be able to acquire sufficient knowledge and\nskills to do top quality research in that field is not high. And perhaps\nit will even be hard to get unbiased reports on the quality of the work,\nif the candidate did not get into the field through the usual channels.\nBut it's not so unrealistic as to be unimaginable.\n\nI hope everyone would agree that doing extra work, well away from what\none was hired to do, is not a bad thing. It shouldn't count against the\ncandidate for tenure. Indeed, it is good to show some ability to stretch\nout. When I say FRA and FRAD are false, I very much do not mean that one\nis obliged to not do any other kind of research.[^5] The more research\nthe better! But first things first.\n\nSo why do I think FRA is false? And why do I think it would be\nreasonable for universities to insist that their candidates for tenure\ndo some research on what they were hired to do.[^6] Well, let's start by\nlooking at an extreme case that might be thought to motivate something\nlike FRA. The following would be unreasonable behaviour on the part of a\nhiring department. A candidate is hired on the basis of an excellent\ndissertation on peer disagreement, which has led to two publications in\ngood journals, and there are two more papers under review from the\ndissertation. The hiring department expects her to keep doing just this\nkind of work.\n\nBut soon after she arrives at her new job, she surveys the most recent\nwork on peer disagreement and decides the debate is dead. There is, she\nthinks, nothing more to say about this debate. It is an ex-debate, it\nhas ceased to be, it is no more, it has shuffled off this mortal coil\nand is now pushing up the roofs of the libraries.[^7] So rather than\nscream into the void, she decides to take what she has learned in\ndebates about disagreement and apply them to more vibrant debates about\ntestimony, and about judgment aggregation. And between getting hired and\ncoming up for tenure, she writes a series of high quality, widely cited,\npapers on these topics in respected journals.\n\nBut then the hiring department gets upset at time for tenure review. We\nhired you to work on peer disagreement, they say, and what have we here?\nNothing at all on peer disagreement, but all this stuff on these\ndistinct, though admittedly related, fields. That's not enough, we say,\nfor promotion to tenure.\n\nThis is poor behaviour on the part of the hiring department, and so\nunreasonable that I find anything like this happening in a real\ndepartment almost inconceivable. (Though some departments do have an\nimpressively dogged commitment to unreasonableness, so perhaps I should\nbe careful here about the link between conceivability and possibility.)\nBut we can say more than just why it is unreasonable. There is a good\nstory about what makes it unreasonable.\n\nAcademic debates die. Everything that needs to be said is said, and it's\ntime to start talking about something new. When that happens, it is\nwrong to keep plowing these barren fields. And the people best\npositioned to spot the death of a debate are experts, with dedicated\nknowledge. Outsiders may suspect that if nothing new is happening, the\nparticipants are just tired following a prolonged squawk. Or, perhaps\nmore likely, outsiders will confuse mere squawking for actual progress.\nThe people best positioned to determine whether it is worth investing\nmore resources in a debate are participants to it. If our imagined\ncandidate has decided that the debate is dead, then it will usually be\nreasonable to defer to her expert judgment. I'm assuming here that when\nit comes to particular areas of debate, an assistant professor will be\nan expert, even compared to her senior colleagues. She will know, and\nthey won't know, the details of what has been happening in the very\nrecent literature, and how much those details matter. Sometimes that\nwon't be true; her colleagues will be experts. But it will be usually\ntrue, and so it is safe to assume it is true when considering\nhypothetical cases for the purposes of policy development.\n\nOne other relevant fact about academic debates is that they are not\nisolated. An expert on one debate won't automatically become an expert\non all related questions, but she won't be a novice either. In the peer\ndisagreement example, it is very natural to think that our expert will\nknow a lot about testimony and about judgment aggregation. Those debates\nare both highly relevant to disagreement. So it is reasonable to expect\nthat if our candidate slid into those debates, she would produce\nexcellent work. And, recall, that is exactly what happened in the\nexample.\n\nPutting these two thoughts together, we get the following conclusions.\nAllowing people to drift between nearby areas of research will not, on\nthe whole, reduce the quality of their research. And allowing the people\nwho are experts in a particular debate to choose when to move between\nnearby fields, we can leverage their knowledge of those fields to ensure\nthat their work remains relevant to lively debates.\n\nThese considerations support a freedom to drift, to move from one area\nof research to adjacent areas without needing approval from a central\nauthority. And that's already a kind of academic freedom. The motivation\nhere has a family resemblance to Hayek's argument that a virtue of\nmarkets is that they provide a way for the system to leverage the\nexpertise that market participants typically have, at least about areas\nimmediately relevant to them  [@Hayek1945]. And this Hayekian flavour to\nthe argument shouldn't be surprising. The alternative to a model where\nacademics have some freedom to choose the direction of their research is\none where a central planner chooses everyone's research topic for them.\nAnd arguing against the success of such central planning models was a\ncentral concern of Hayek's throughout his career.\n\nSo academics, even junior ones, should have elbow room (to borrow a\nmetaphor from Daniel Dennett). But it's a long way from this to\nendorsing FRA. Indeed, the considerations that supported a freedom to\ndrift could not possibly support FRA. For one thing, the fact that one\nwas good enough to be hired in one particular sub-field does not\nindicate that one will have particularly expert judgment on whether it\nis a good use of university resources to have (more) research conducted\non a particular field distant from one's own. And for another thing, the\nfact that one was hired in one field is little to no evidence that one\nwould be the right person to conduct that research, even if it were in\nthe university's interests. So if there is a wide ranging freedom to\nresearch on whatever takes one's fancy, it will need radically different\njustification to this.\n\nIt is hard to see what that justification could possibly be. There are\npeople who are given awards that are meant to support any kind of\nresearch that they find interesting. The MacArthur Fellows Program, the\nso-called 'genius grant', is like this. And it seems suitable for people\nwho have made spectacular contributions, and will likely continue to do\nso. It seems particularly suitable for people who have already shown an\nability to create great works that require leaping between seemingly\ndistant fields. If, for example, you can use hip-hop to turn the story\nof the most elitist of the founding fathers into a popular phenomenon,\nthen someone should probably give you untied funding to just see what\nhappens next.\n\nBut a junior professorship is not a MacArthur Fellowship. Indeed, it is\ndangerous to think that it is, or that it should be. It encourages the\nidea that universities should be looking to hire geniuses, rather than\nhiring people who have put in the hard work to get to where they are in\ntheir field, and are likely to keep getting further results by a\ncontinued application of just that kind of hard work. At least some of\nthe time, perhaps most of the time, the question of just how smart the\ncandidate is should be considerably less relevant to a job search than\nthe question of what they have achieved, and what those achievements\nsignal about their likely future research contributions.[^8] Yet if\neveryone who was hired was been given a free rein to work on anything\nwhatsoever, if every hire was the equivalent to bestowing a MacArthur\nFellowship, then whether the candidate was some kind of genius would be\na central, perhaps sole, criteria.\n\nIf we were going to say any academic should work on whatever they like,\nor even whatever they like in their department's research purview, we\nneed to do one of two things:\n\n1.  Show how this freedom is consistent with the idea that departments\n    can, in hiring, take area of research into account; or\n\n2.  Argue that the very widespread practice of taking area of research\n    into account in hiring is indefensible.\n\nI actually have some sympathy for option 2 here, but it would be an\nincredibly radical step.[^9] So let's investigate the prospects for\noption 1. I think they are rather dim.\n\nThe motivation for hiring by research field seems straightforward.\nDepartments have (allegedly) an interest in having researchers working\non diverse fields. And hiring people who have worked in diverse fields\nis one way to meet that interest. But given FRA, or even FRAD, there is\na big gap in this motivation. All that we can know by looking at a job\napplication file is what a person has worked on. The department,\npresumably, has an interest in there being diversity in what its members\nwill work on. And we need a bridge between past work and future work\nhere.\n\nOne way of bridging this gap would be to insist that the newly hired\nacademic work continue to do (some) research on (roughly) the areas they\nwere hired to work on. I think that's the right way to bridge the gap,\nbut it is inconsistent with FRA and FRAD.\n\nAnother way would be to take past research interests as noisy indicators\nof future research interests. So if you want to hire in philosophy of\nbiology, you might hire someone who has worked in philosophy of biology\nto increase the probability that that's what they'll work in. The\nproblem with this reasoning is that hiring the person who is most likely\nto do the best work in the area you want to hire in will lead to some\nbad choices in realistic scenarios. Imagine you want to hire in\nphilosophy of biology, and you have three candidates.\n\n-   A is the best philosopher of the bunch, but has at best a passing\n    interest in philosophy of biology.\n\n-   B is the best philosopher of biology, but also has a very strong\n    interest (including a book manuscript in progress) on a completely\n    different field.\n\n-   C is nearly as good as B at philosophy of biology, and has no other\n    philosophical interests.\n\nIf you want to maximise the expected value of research your department\ndoes on philosophy of biology, and FRA or FRAD are in place, the best\nthing to do hire C. After all, there is a non-trivial chance that B will\njust work on their book manuscript and related papers, and indeed use it\nto get tenure. If you want to maximise the expected value of research\nyour department does in philosophy, the best thing to do is to hire A.\nThey are the best philosopher. What's hard to see is the motivation for\nmaking what intuitively is the right choice here, hiring B. The\nsolution, I think, is to ditch FRAD, and hire B with the explicit\nrequirement that they do a certain amount of work in philosophy of\nbiology.\n\nLet's say that FRA is false then, and conclude with a more focussed look\nat FRAD as it applies to tenure cases. This is a somewhat more practical\nmatter, since FRAD is more like the rule that is applied in actual\ntenure cases. Indeed, here is what the handbook at the University of\nMichigan (my employer) says about tenure review,\n\n> After the appropriate probationary period (see section 6.C \"Tenure\n> Probationary Period\"), tenure may be granted to those instructional\n> faculty members whose professional accomplishments indicate that they\n> will continue to serve with distinction in their appointed roles.\n> Tenure is awarded to those who demonstrate excellent teaching,\n> outstanding research and scholarship, and substantial additional\n> service, **each of which must be relevant to the goals and needs of\n> the University, college and department**. The award of tenure is based\n> on the achievement of distinction in an area of learning and the\n> prediction of continued eminence throughout the individual's\n> professional career  [@MichTenureB emphasis added]\n\nAs far as I can tell, in practice the bolded clause is interpreted in\nline with something like FRAD. The wording is ambiguous; it could just\nas easily be read as supporting the elbow room standard that I prefer.\nBut I don't believe that's how things work in practice.\n\nWe have two questions to answer then. First, how similar are FRAD and\nthe elbow room standard? And second, in cases where they differ, which\nprovides a better model for building a university. I think they are not\nparticularly similar, and the elbow room standard is much better.\n\nThere is, of course, a certain similarity between the two standards.\nFRAD says work on whatever you like, provided it is in the same\ndiscipline as the work that got you hired. The elbow room standard says\nwork on whatever you like, provided it is sufficiently similar (along\nsome salient dimension) to the work that got you hired. And being in the\nsame department is a dimension of similarity. But it isn't, ultimately,\na particularly important one. Making it of central importance, as FRAD\ndoes, leads to numerous avoidable errors.\n\nFor one thing, FRAD gives some academics more freedom to switch fields\nthan the elbow room standard could possibly justify. Philosophy is a\nvery broad field. Just because one is doing really excellent work in one\nfield is very little evidence that one will be able to do excellent work\nin another field. Thinking that it is evidence is to just relapse into a\nrestricted version of the myth, or cult, of genius. So at least in some\ncases, the elbow room standard will be more restrictive than FRAD. But\nin other cases it will be less restrictive, and those are perhaps more\nimportant in practice.\n\nDisciplines have boundaries. Those boundaries are vague, but they are\nthere. Some people work on topics that are very near to a boundary, and\nsome work on topics that are far from a boundary. FRAD impacts these two\ngroups in very different ways, and the difference is unfair. Someone\nwhose work is near a boundary can't just drift into any nearby field,\nsince the nearby fields may be outside the disciplinary bounds. To take\none clear example, a researcher hired for work on the semantics of\nmodals can easily drift into other areas of semantics, or onto modal\nfallacies in argumentation, but not into work on the syntax of modals.\nFor whatever reason, we've decided the boundary between philosophy and\nnot-philosophy around here is very close to the the syntax-semantics\nboundary. And this is a violation of the elbow room principle, since\nthis kind of move from the semantics to the syntax of a particular class\nof expressions is just the kind of move to a closely related field that\nthe elbow room principle is designed to protect.\n\nIt won't help here to say that there should be overlapping areas of\nresearch concern between departments. The crucial question is the\nboundary between X and not-X, not the boundary between X and Y. If\nsomeone is near the X/not-X boundary, they could have a tenure home in\nX, and then drift into not-X. They deserve protection in their research,\nand FRAD wouldn't provide it. It would perhaps help if literally every\npossible area of research was such that there was some department it was\nnot just in, but in without being near the boundary. But a world with\nacademic departments organised that way feels very different to the one\nwe are in.\n\nIn won't help to say we should just make the boundaries larger. Unless\nwe abolish the boundaries altogether, the problem will persist. And\nabolishing all the boundaries would create more problems than it solves.\nThe boundaries play useful roles right now. It is good that hiring and\ntenure decisions for, say, a position in metaphysics are made by people\nwith a broad range of philosophical backgrounds, and not (in the first\ninstance) by an arbitrary collection of people from across the\nuniversity. The ideal here is not no boundaries, but porous\nboundaries.[^10] Boundaries exist so that local experts, and people with\nspecial local interests, get extra say on questions of local concern,\nbut they are porous so they get in the way of freedoms. Replacing FRAD\nwith the elbow room principle gets the balance right.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the boundaries are vague. In general, if\nsomething is true no matter how a vague term is made precise, it is a\ngood bet that it is true.[^11] But we can say a bit more about why\nvagueness doesn't matter in this particular case. The following\nprinciple looks both true, and the best bet for why we might think vague\ndisciplinary boundaries make FRAD more palatable.\n\n-   If someone's work is clearly within discipline X, then any related\n    area they could reasonably drift into under the elbow room principle\n    will not be clearly outside discipline X.\n\nIf everyone who is hired is clearly working within X, then FRAD might be\nno more restrictive than the elbow room principle. After all, any\npermissible drift will not take one clearly outside one's home\ndiscipline.\n\nThe problem is that only hiring people whose work is clearly within the\nhiring discipline is a terrible idea. Indeed, it is a worse idea than\nFRAD. It ensures that one will only hire in safe, traditional areas of\nresearch. And that's a plan for stagnation, not for doing the best\nresearch. Sometimes we have to hire people on the frontiers, and\nsometimes their work will drift clearly outside one's discipline. That's\njust a cost of having a dynamic research program, and attempts to avoid\npaying this cost will make things even worse.\n\nThere is one problem that vague disciplinary boundaries does help with.\nVague boundaries are easier to shift than precise boundaries. That's\nbecause there was never any agreement on where they were in the first\nplace, so no agreement has to be overturned. And if enough people work\nwho were hired in X start working on an area that used to be outside X,\nwe should just start treating that area as inside X. But we don't have\nto make this conceptual shift every time a good philosopher does good\nwork on a nearby topic. Some good work is in other fields, and that's\nok.\n\nThere are other odd features of FRAD. If applied consistently, it would\nlead to treating some like cases in very unlike ways. There are several\nfields that are set up as departments in some universities, and as\nprograms in other universities. For example, in America right now there\nis a divide among universities about whether to set up things like\nWomen's Studies, Cognitive Science, and PPE as independent departments,\nor as programs run collaboratively by a number of different departments.\nThere are administrative considerations on either side of this choice,\nand these considerations vary somewhat between different universities.\nIf they are set up as programs, then anyone hired in to them will have a\ntenure home in one of the constituent departments. And given FRAD, that\nwill put certain limitations on their research. Those limitations will\nbe very different to what they would face if the unit were its own\ndepartment. But it seems very wrong to think the administrative decision\nto set up a unit as a department or a program impact the freedoms of\npeople hired to work in those unites. Where FRAD applies, however, this\ndifference is dramatic. Someone hired in a philosophy department to\nsupport a Cognitive Science program could move to work on philosophy of\nreligion, but not experimental developmental psychology. Someone hired\nby a Cognitive Science department would have the opposite set of\nfreedoms. I'm not sure what is optimal here, but it is very odd that an\nadministrative decision should impact researchers in this way.\n\nBut the biggest problem with FRAD is that it makes the disciplinary\nboundaries too important. Young researchers shouldn't have to second\nguess whether a particular development of their research is inside or\noutside a vague, shifting, boundary. The solution isn't to abolish these\nboundaries, any more than rights of free movement across an area is a\nreason to abolish all political boundaries within that area.[^12]\nRather, the solution is to downplay them. If exercising their elbow room\nrights takes an academic outside the purview of their home department,\nthat's just a cost of having a dynamic research program.\n\nAnd it is really the effect on these younger scholars, trying to\npre-judge what their reviewers at tenure time will think, that I'm most\ninterested in here. As I noted above, I don't know of any clear cases\nwhere someone was turned down for tenure because their research was in\nthe wrong area. But I know many cases of academics who have put off more\nspeculative research projects until after their tenure review. And the\nreason, typically, has been that they are nervous that the outputs of\nthe new project would be discounted, merely in virtue of their subject\nmatter, at the time of tenure review. This feels like an undesirable\nfeature of the status quo, and one that could be remedied by rethinking\nwhy we care about what an individual academic works on.\n\nSo while I disagree with the strongest statements of academic freedom, I\nthink the position I'm endorsing allows greater freedom in practice than\nexisting practices like FRAD. There are, I would guess, many more people\nwho are worried that their research is drifting away from what their\ncolleagues will regard as *really* part of the discipline than there are\npeople who would like the freedom to jump to an area they have no\ntraining, expertise or background in. Defending the elbow room\nprinciple, or freedom to drift, will take care of those concerns. And\nthe principle is much easier to defend in theory than FRA or FRAD. So\nit, I think, is the core important principle concerning academics'\nrights to direct their own research.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nI've focussed here exclusively on research, and not at all on teaching.\nBut in many ways what I'm saying here could be summarised as the view\nthat the norms concerning topic choice are fairly similar in research\nand in teaching. If I'm given a course on history of political\nphilosophy to teach, then I better teach history of political\nphilosophy, and not, say, formal logic, or Australian geography, or\nbaseball statistics.[^13] It isn't in any way a violation of academic\nfreedom if I'm required to teach the subject I signed up to teach.\n\nBut in practice, and in theory, there is a lot of freedom within the\nboundaries of a course. If I want my history of political philosophy\ncourse to include thinkers who are not commonly central to the story\nAnglophone political philosophy tells about itself, I should (and\ntypically would) be free to include them. If I think the most relevant\nsecondary literature is by people in departments other than philosophy\n(e.g., history, political science, women's studies, etc) then I should\nbe able to base my syllabus around such writers. Now I personally\nhaven't taught history of political philosophy since I was a\npost-doctoral fellow who was too nervous to consider any such plan. But\nit's exactly the kind of thing academic freedom should protect - and I\nsuspect in most cases it is what academic freedom would protect.\n\nThe same I think should go for research. If one is hired to research\nhistory of political philosophy, then it is reasonable for the\nuniversity to require that one do just that. It isn't reasonable to\nrequire one do only that; people should be allowed to explore what they\nwant. But it is reasonable to require some work on what one was hired to\ndo. Yet if doing that takes one outside the bounds of what is\n(hereabouts) considered philosophy, that should be fine too. Do what\nyou're hired to do is a good principle; FRAD is not.\n\nThe picture of academia I'm trying to promote is one where more units\nare free to operate the way that Paul Romer describes the Marron\nInstitute of Urban Management at NYU as operating.\n\n> [I]nstead of giving its faculty members the usual freedom to study\n> anything that that seems interesting, the institute lets the problems\n> that cities face set its research agenda. Because these choices are\n> not the usual ones on campus, many people complained.  [@Romer2016]\n\nIf universities want to give people complete freedom to set their own\nresearch agenda, I'm not going to complain about that (much). What I\nwant to deny is that setting up things like the Marron Institute is a\nviolation of academic freedom. There is a lot to be gained by hiring\npeople for relatively specific research tasks, and it isn't a violation\nof their freedom to hire them in this way. And that's especially true if\nthe constraints on their research agenda are set just by the questions\nthat their research team is focussed on, and not by the disciplinary\nhomes that house the thinkers they engage with.\n\n[^1]: Retrieved from\n    <https://provost.uchicago.edu/handbook/research/research-policies>.\n    Both this quote and the Bickel quote are cited by Richard A.\n    @Schweder2015.\n\n[^2]: Just to be clear, I'm not denying that the arguments given below\n    could apply to tenured academics just as easily as non-tenured ones.\n    But doing so would be a very radical break from current practice,\n    and motivating such a radical break would need much more careful\n    discussion than I have space to do here.\n\n[^3]: I will use the term 'university' here for any post-secondary\n    educational institution that hires professors with an expectation\n    they will produce some research. Many of these institutions have\n    'college' rather than 'university' in their name, but I'm calling\n    them all universities.\n\n[^4]: As I'll return to below, the main way the issues I'm discussing\n    impact everyday academic life is that expectations of how tenure\n    reviews will be conducted affect how pre-tenured academics structure\n    their research profiles. As any game theorist knows, the nature of\n    non-equilibrium outcomes can be profoundly important to the actual\n    world, even if they are never reached.\n\n[^5]: I wasn't hired to write articles like this one, but there isn't, I\n    hope, anything wrong with my writing it.\n\n[^6]: There is an important caveat here. It would be completely\n    unreasonable for a university to decide, just as a candidate comes\n    up for tenure, that they really wanted the candidate to have been\n    doing different research for the past six years. The question is\n    what behaviour on the part of universities would be reasonable if it\n    were clearly communicated well in advance.\n\n[^7]: Full disclosure: I have a book manuscript under review with a long\n    discussion of peer disagreement.\n\n[^8]: Sarah-Jane Leslie's work (with various colleagues) has shown that\n    there is a strong correlation between how strongly people think that\n    brilliance is required for producing good work in a field, and the\n    gender distribution of faculty in the field\n     [@LeslieScience2015; @LeslieFrontiers2015; @LesliePLOS2016].\n    Thinking that whoever is hired can work on anything, and it will\n    probably be good if the work they originally did was good, seems\n    similar to me to taking raw talent to be the primary requisite for\n    successful work.\n\n    The primary argument of this paper has been the requiring academics\n    to do at least a certain amount of work in a particular area is not\n    a violation of academic freedom. It is no violation of academic\n    freedom to set up something like NYU's Marron Institute (discussed\n    further below). The considerations of this paragraph suggest\n    something stronger, that it is positively bad to not require (most)\n    academics to do work in a particular area, because to not do this\n    encourages an invidious cult of genius. I'm not endorsing this\n    stronger claim, but these considerations do look like the germ of an\n    argument for it.\n\n[^9]: As of November 16, 2016, there were 209 jobs advertised on\n    PhilJobs.org, and by my count only 36 did not put some restrictions\n    or desiderata on the research area of the hired candidate.\n\n[^10]: Academia is hardly the only place where this is the ideal.\n\n[^11]: This principle traces back at least to @Keynes1936 [Ch. 6].\n\n[^12]: By analogy, it's a good thing that Ann Arbor has a city council,\n    and it's a good thing that there are no barriers to moving in or out\n    of Ann Arbor.\n\n[^13]: Compare the discussion of academic freedom and the requirement to\n    teach the topic of the class in @Cole2015. The example of teaching\n    Australian geography in a class that is not on that is taken from\n    one of their survey respondents.\n",
