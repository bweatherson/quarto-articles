The chapter discusses that different people may have different standards for knowledge, so perhaps they may mean different things by a statement, because they communicate to meet their preferred standards for knowledge. Standards for knowledge are not the kind of thing that people can differ on without making a mistake, in the way one would say that different people can have different immediate goals (about what to have for dinner) without making a mistake. This explains that one does not just adopt questioners' standards for knowledge while answering their knowledge questions. So, it is argued that questions involving “knows” should have the three properties—speaker, clarification, and different answers. However, the counter argument is that the proposition can be true relative to some contexts and false relative to other contexts, just as temporality about propositions that a proposition can be true at some times and false at other times, and the utterance is true if the proposition is true only in the context of the utterance.\ndate: July 31 2006\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1016/B978-008044979-1/50010-2\"\ncategories:\n  - language\n  - epistemology\n  - contextualism\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-008044979-1/50010-2\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: liverpool.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nThere are currently a dizzying variety of theories on the market holding\nthat whether an utterance of the form *A knows that p* is true depends\non pragmatic or contextual factors. Even if we allow that pragmatics\nmatters, there are three questions to be answered. First, *whose*\ninterests matter? Here there are three options: the interests of *A*\nmatter, the interests of the person making the knowledge ascription\nmatter, or the interests of the person evaluating the ascription matter.\nSecond, *which* kind of pragmatic factors matter? Broadly speaking, the\ndebate here is about whether practical interests (the stakes involved)\nor intellectual interests (which propositions are being considered) are\nmost important. Third, *how* do pragmatic factors matter? Here there is\nnot even a consensus about what the options are.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Aspects of Knowing_, edited by Stephen Hetherington, Elsevier, 133-147.\n\nPicture via [Järnvägsmuseet](https://digitaltmuseum.se/021018098382/euston-liverpool-express-nara-weedon).\n</aside>\n\nThis paper is about the first question. I'm going to present some data\nfrom the behaviour of questions about who knows what that show it is not\nthe interests of the person making the knowledge ascription that matter.\nThis means the view normally known as *contextualism* about\nknowledge-ascriptions is false. Since that term is a little contested,\nand for some suggests merely the view that someone's context matters,\nI'll introduce three different terms for the three answers to the first\nquestion.\n\nConsider a token utterance by B of *A knows that p*. This utterance is\nbeing evaluated by C. A *semantic pragmatist* about knowledge\nascriptions says that whether C can correctly evaluate that utterance as\ntrue or false depends on some salient party's context or interests.[^1]\nWe can produce a quick taxonomy of semantic pragmatist positions by\nlooking at which of the three parties is the salient one.\n\nType A pragmatism\n\n:   A's context or interests matter.\n\nType B pragmatism\n\n:   B's context or interests matter.\n\nType C pragmatism\n\n:   C's context or interests matter.\n\nType A pragmatism is defended by @Hawthorne2004 under the name\n'subject-sensitive invariantism' and @Stanley2005-STAKAP under the name\n'interest-relative invariantism'. The theory commonly known as\n*contextualism*, defended by @Cohen1986, @DeRose1995 and @Lewis1996b, is\na form of *Type B* pragmatism. On their theory, the semantic value of\n'knows' depends on the context in which it is uttered, i.e. B's context.\n(And the salient feature of B's context is, broadly speaking, B's\ninterests.) Recently @MacFarlane2009-MACNC has outlined a very different\nvariant of Type B pragmatism that we will discuss below. Type C\npragmatism is the radical view that the token utterance does not have a\ncontext-invariant truth value, so one and the same utterance can be\nproperly evaluated as true by one evaluator and false by another. This\nposition is outlined, and defended, by @MacFarlane2005-Knowledge.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to argue *against* Type B pragmatism. I'll\nshow that there is a striking disanalogy between the behaviour of\n'knows' in questions and the behaviour of terms for which a Type B-type\ntheory is true. The best explanation for this disanalogy is that Type B\ntheories, contextualism included, are false.[^2]\n\nI won't be addressing the second or third questions here, but I'll\nassume (basically for ease of exposition) that the right answer to the\nsecond has more to do with *practical* than *intellectual* interests. So\na sceptical possibility becomes relevant not because anyone is actively\nconsidering it, but because it makes a difference to someone's actions.\nEverything I say here should be restatable given any answer to that\nquestion, so little beyond exposition turns on this.\n\n### Basic Indexicals in Questions\n\nAs well as considering these three pragmatic theories about 'know', we\ncan consider similar theories about other words. We'll start with words\nthat are universally considered to be indexicals. Consider the following\nthree theories about 'here'.\n\nType A pragmatism\n\n:   A token of 'here' denotes the location of the subject of the\n    sentence in which it appears.\n\nType B pragmatism\n\n:   A token of 'here' denotes the location of the speaker.\n\nType C pragmatism\n\n:   A token of 'here' denotes the location of the person evaluating the\n    sentence.\n\nSo when C evaluates B's utterance *A is here*, the Type A pragmatist\nsays that it gets evaluated as true iff A is where A is, the Type B\npragmatist says that it gets evaluated as true iff A is where B is, and\nthe Type C pragmatist says that it gets evaluated as true iff A is where\nC is. Obviously Type B pragmatism is true in general about 'here', as it\nis for all obvious indexicals.[^3] What we're interested in for now,\nhowever, is not its truth but the kind of evidence that can be adduced\nfor it. One very simple way of separating out these three theories\ninvolves questions, as in the following example.\n\nWatson is at a party in Liverpool, and he is worried that Moriarty is\nthere as well. He calls Holmes, who is tracking Moriarty's movements by\nsatellite, and asks (1).\n\nThis question has three properties that are distinctive of questions\ninvolving indexicals.\n\nSPEAKER\n\n:   How Holmes should answer the question depends on the speaker's (i.e.\n    Watson's) environment, not his own and not Moriarty's. It would be\n    wrong to say \"Yes\" because Moriarty is where he is, or \"No\" because\n    Moriarty is not in the lab with Holmes following the satellite\n    movement.\n\nCLARIFICATION\n\n:   It is permissible in certain contexts to ask the speaker for more\n    information about their context before answering. If Holmes's is\n    unsure of Watson's location, he can reply with \"Where are you?\"\n    rather than answering directly.[^4]\n\nDIFFERENT ANSWERS\n\n:   If two different people, who are in different locations, ask Holmes\n    (1), he can answer differently. Assume that Moriarty is at the\n    party, so Holmes says \"Yes\" in reply to Watson. Lestrade then calls\n    from Scotland Yard, because he is worried that Moriarty has broken\n    in and asks Holmes (1). Holmes says \"No\", and this is consistent\n    with his previous answer.\n\nQuestions involving indexicals have a fourth property that we'll return\nto from time to time in what follows.\n\nNEGATIVE AGREEMENT\n\n:   It is coherent to answer the question by saying \"No\", then basically\n    repeating the question, inverting the verb-subject order so you have\n    an indicative sentence. So Holmes could consistently (if falsely in\n    this story) say, \"No, Moriarty is here.\"\n\nThe truth of Type B Pragmatism about 'here' explains, indeed predicts,\nthat (1) has these properties. If a correct answer is a true answer,\nthen Type B Pragmatism directly entails that (1) has SPEAKER. That\nassumption (that correctness is truth) plus the fact that you can speak\nto someone without knowing their location implies that (1) has\nCLARIFICATION, and adding the fact that different people can be in\ndifferent locations implies that (1) has DIFFERENT ANSWERS. Whether\nHolmes can say *Moriarty is here* depends whether he can truthfully\nanswer his own question *Is Moriarty here?* so NEGATIVE AGREEMENT is\nrelated to DIFFERENT ANSWERS. For these reasons it isn't surprising that\nother terms that are agreed on all sides to be indexicals generate\nquestions that have all four properties. For instance, because 'me' is\nan indexical, (2) has all four properties.\n\nThis suggests a hypothesis, that all terms for which Type B pragmatism\nis true generate questions with those four properties. This hypothesis\nseems to be false; some terms for which Type B pragmatism is true do not\ngenerate questions that have NEGATIVE AGREEMENT. But a weaker claim,\nthat all terms for which Type B pragmatism is true generate questions\nwith the first three properties, does seem to be true.[^5] Or so I will\nargue in the next section.\n\n### Other Type B terms in Questions\n\nVarious philosophers have argued that a version of Type B pragmatism is\ntrue for each of the following four terms: 'tall', 'empty', 'ready' and\n'everyone'. Various defenders of Type B pragmatism about 'knows' have\nargued that 'knows' is analogous to terms on this list. In this section\nI'll argue that questions involving those four terms have the first\nthree properties of questions listed above, though they don't seem to\nhave NEGATIVE AGREEMENT. In the next section I'll argue that questions\ninvolving 'know' do not have those three properties. These facts combine\nto form an argument against the hypothesis that Type B pragmatism is\ntrue of 'knows'. (The argument here does not turn on supposing that Type\nB pragmatism is true of these four terms. All I want to argue for is the\nclaim that any term for which Type B pragmatism is true generates\nquestions with the first three properties. It is possible that other\nterms also generate these kinds of questions, but this possibility\ndoesn't threaten the argument.) The examples involving these four terms\nwill be a little complicated, but the intuitions about them are clear.\n\nMoriarty has hired a new lackey, a twelve year old jockey. She is tall\nfor a twelve year old girl, and tall for a jockey, but not tall for a\nperson. Moriarty is most interested in her abilities as a jockey, so he\nworries that she's tall. Holmes is also most interested in her *qua*\njockey. Watson has noted that Moriarty never hires people who are tall\nfor adults (he thinks this is because Moriarty likes lording over his\nlackeys) and is wondering whether the new hire fits this property. He\nasks Holmes (3).\n\nHolmes should say \"No\". What matters is whether she is tall *by the\nstandards Watson cares about*, not whether she is tall by the standards\nHolmes cares about (i.e. jockeys) or the standards Moriarty cares about\n(i.e. also jockeys). So (3) has SPEAKER. Lestrade wants information from\nHolmes about the lackey so his men can pick her up. They have this\nconversation.\n\n> Lestrade: Is Moriarty's new lackey tall? My men are looking for her.\n>\n> Holmes: Where are they looking?\n>\n> Lestrade: At her school.\n>\n> Holmes: Yes, she looks like she could be fourteen or fifteen.\n\nHolmes quite properly asks for a clarification of the question so as to\nwork out what standards for tallness are in play, so (3) has\nCLARIFICATION. And he properly gives different answers to Watson and\nLestrade, so it has DIFFERENT ANSWERS. But note that 'tall' doesn't have\nNEGATIVE AGREEMENT. Holmes can't answer (3) with \"No, she's tall.\" I\nwon't repeat this observation for the other terms discussed in this\nsection, but the point generalises.\n\nNext we'll consider 'empty'. Holmes and Watson are stalking Moriarty at\na party. Watson is mixing poisons, and Holmes is trying to slip the\npoison into Moriarty's glass. Unfortunately Moriarty has just about\nfinished his drink, and might be about to abandon it. Watson is\nabsent-mindedly trying to concoct the next poison, but he seems to have\nrun out of mixing dishes.\n\n> Watson: Is Moriarty's glass empty?\n>\n> Holmes: What do you want it for?\n>\n> Watson: I need something dry to mix this poison in.\n>\n> Holmes: No, it's got a small bit of ice left in it.\n>\n> (Lestrade arrives, and sees Holmes holding a vial.)\n>\n> Lestrade: Why haven't you moved in? Is Moriarty's glass empty?\n>\n> Holmes: Yes. He should get another soon.\n\nHolmes behaves entirely appropriately here, and his three responses show\nthat the question *Is Moriarty's glass empty?* has the CLARIFICATION,\nSPEAKER and DIFFERENT ANSWERS properties respectively. Note in\nparticular that the glass is empty by the standards that matter to\nMoriarty and Holmes (i.e. it's got not much more than ice left in it)\ndoesn't matter to how Holmes should answer until someone with the same\ninterests, Lestrade, asks about the glass.\n\nThird, we'll look at 'ready'. Moriarty is planning four things: to rob\nthe Bank of England, to invade Baker St and kill Holmes, to invade\nScotland Yard to free his friends, and to leave for a meeting of\ncriminals where they will plan for the three missions. Moriarty cares\nmost about the first plan, Holmes about the second, and Lestrade about\nthe third, but right now Watson cares most about the fourth because it's\nhis job to track Moriarty to the meeting. Holmes is tracking Moriarty\nthrough an installed spycam.\n\n> Watson: Is Moriarty ready?\n>\n> Holmes: Yes. You should go now.\n>\n> (Watson departs and Lestrade arrives)\n>\n> Lestrade: Is Moriarty ready?\n>\n> Holmes: Who's that? Oh, hello Inspector. No, he still has to plan the\n> attack out.\n\nAgain, Holmes's answers show that the question *Is Moriarty ready?* has\nthe CLARIFICATION, SPEAKER and DIFFERENT ANSWERS properties. Note that\nin this case the issue of whether Moriarty is ready for the thing he\ncares most about, and the issue of whether he is ready for the thing\nHolmes cares most about, are not relevant to Holmes's answers. It is the\ninterests of the different speakers that matter, which suggests that if\none of the three types of pragmatism is true about 'ready', it is Type B\npragmatism.\n\nFinally we'll look at 'everyone'. @Lewis1996b suggests that 'know' is\ndirectly analogous to 'every', so the two words should behave the same\nway in questions. Moriarty's gang just robbed a department store while\nthe royal family, along with many police, were there. Holmes is most\ninterested in how this affected the royals, Watson in how the public\nreacted, Lestrade in how his police reacted, and Moriarty merely in his\nmen and his gold. The public, and the royals, were terrified by the raid\non the store, but the police reacted bravely.\n\n> Watson: Did Moriarty's men terrify everyone?\n>\n> Holmes: Her majesty and her party were quite shocked. Oh, you mean\n> *everyone*. Yes, the masses there were completely stunned.\n>\n> (Lestrade enters.)\n>\n> Lestrade: I just heard about the raid. How did they get through\n> security? Did Moriarty's men terrify everyone?\n>\n> Holmes: No, your men did their job, but they were outnumbered.\n\nAgain, Holmes's answers show that the question *Did Moriarty's men\nterrify everyone?* has the CLARIFICATION, SPEAKER and DIFFERENT ANSWERS\nproperties. And again, what the quantifier domain would be if Holmes\nwere to use the word 'everyone', namely all the royal family, is\nirrelevant to how he should answer a question involving 'everyone'.\nThat's the distinctive feature of expressions for which Type B\npragmatism is true, and it suggests that in this respect at least\n'everyone' behaves as if Type B pragmatism is true of it.\n\n### Questions about Knowledge\n\nWe have two reasons for thinking that if Type B pragmatism is true about\n'knows', then questions about knowledge should have all the SPEAKER,\nCLARIFICATION and DIFFERENT ANSWERS properties. First, the assumption\nthat correct answers are true answers plus trivial facts about the\nenvironment (namely that environments are not always fully known and\ndiffer between speakers) implies that the questions have these\nproperties. Second, many words that are either uncontroversial or\ncontroversial instances where Type B pragmatism is true generate\nquestions with these properties. So if 'knows' is meant to be analogous\nto these controversial examples, questions about knowledge should have\nthese properties. I'll argue in this section that knowledge questions do\nnot have these properties. Again we'll work through a long example to\nshow this.\n\nLast week Watson discovered where Moriarty was storing a large amount of\ngold, and retrieved it. Moriarty is now coming to Baker St to try to get\nthe gold back, and Holmes is planning a trap for him. Moriarty has made\neducated guesses that it was Watson (rather than Holmes) who retrieved\nthe gold, and that Holmes is planning a trap at Baker St Station. But he\ndoesn't have a lot of evidence for either proposition. Holmes has been\nspying on Moriarty, so he knows that Moriarty is in just this position.\nNeither Moriarty nor Holmes care much about who it was who retrieved the\ngold from Moriarty's vault, but this is very important to Watson, who\nplans to write a book about it. On the other hand, that Holmes is\nplanning a trap at Baker St Station is very important to both Holmes and\nMoriarty, but surprisingly unimportant to Watson. He would prefer that\nhe was the hero of the week for recovering the gold, not Holmes for\ncapturing Moriarty. They have this conversation.\n\n> Watson: Does Moriarty know that you've got a trap set up at Baker St\n> Station?\n>\n> Holmes: No, he's just guessing. If I set up a diversion I'm sure I can\n> get him to change his mind.\n>\n> Watson: Does he know it was me who recovered the gold?\n>\n> Holmes: Yes, dear Watson, he figured that out.\n\nThese answers sound to me like the answers Holmes *should* give. Because\nthe trap is practically important to both him and Moriarty, it seems he\nshould say no to the first question unless Moriarty has very strong\nevidence.[^6] But because it is unimportant to Holmes and Moriarty just\nwhat *Watson* did, the fact that Moriarty has a true belief that's based\non the right evidence that Watson recovered the gold is sufficient for\nHolmes to answer the second question \"Yes\". This shows that questions\ninvolving 'knows' do not have the SPEAKER property.\n\nSome might dispute the intuitions involved here, but note that on a\nsimple Type B pragmatist theory, one that sets the context just by the\n*speaker's* interests (as opposed to the speaker *and* her\ninterlocutors) Holmes should assent to (4) and (5).\n\nAnd it is *very* intuitive that if he should assent to (4) and (5), then\nhe should answer \"No\" to Watson's first question, and \"Yes\" to the\nsecond.\n\nSome adherents of a more sophisticated Type B pragmatist theory will not\nsay that Holmes should assent to these two, because they think he should\ntake Watson's interests on board in his use of 'knows'. This is the\n'single scoreboard view' of Keith @DeRose2004.[^7] But we can, with a\nsmall addition of complexity rearrange the case so as to avoid this\ncomplication. Imagine that Watson is not talking to Holmes, but to\nLestrade, and that Lestrade (surprisingly) shares Watson's interests.\nUnbeknownst to the two of them, Holmes is listening in to their\nconversation via a bug. When listening in to conversations, Holmes has\nthe habit of answering any questions that are asked, even if they\nobviously aren't addressed to him. (I do the same thing when watching\nsports broadcasts, though the questions are often mind-numbingly bland.\nListening to the intuitive answers one gives is a good guide to the\ncontent of the question.) So the conversation now goes as follows.\n\n> Watson: Does Moriarty know that Holmes has got a trap set up at Baker\n> St Station?\n>\n> Holmes (eavesdropping): No, he's just guessing. If I set up a\n> diversion I'm sure I can get him to change his mind.\n>\n> Lestrade: I'm not sure. My Moriarty spies aren't doing that well.\n>\n> Watson: Does he know it was me who recovered the gold?\n>\n> Holmes (eavesdropping): Yes, dear Watson, he figured that out.\n\nIt is important here that Holmes is talking *to himself*, even though he\nis using Watson's questions to guide what he says. So it will be a\n*very* extended sense of context if somehow Watson's interests guide\nHolmes's context. Some speakers may be moved by empathy to align their\ninterests with the people they are speaking about, but *Holmes* is not\nsuch a speaker. So Type B pragmatic theories should say that Holmes\nshould endorse (4) and (5) in this context, and intuitively if this is\ntrue he should speak in the above interaction just as I have recorded.\nBut this is just to say that questions about knowledge do not have\nSPEAKER.[^8]\n\nOne might worry that we're changing the rules, since we did not use\neavesdropping situations above in arguing that if Type B pragmatism is\ntrue of 'knows', then questions about knowledge should have SPEAKER. But\nit is a simple exercise to check that even if Holmes is eavesdropping,\nhis answers to questions including 'tall', 'empty', 'ready' and\n'everyone' should still have the three properties. So this change of\nscenery does not tilt the deck against the Type B pragmatist.\n\nCases like this one also suggest that questions involving 'knows' also\nlack the CLARIFICATION and DIFFERENT ANSWERS property. It would be odd\nof Holmes to reply to one of Watson's questions with \"How much does it\nmatter to you?\", as it would be in any case where a questioner who knows\nthat *p* asks whether *S* also knows that *p*. Intuitions about cases\nwhere the questioner does not know that *p* are a little trickier,\nbecause then the respondent can only answer 'yes' if she has sufficient\nevidence to assure the speaker that *p*, and it is quite plausible that\nthe amount of evidence needed to assure someone that *p* varies with the\ninterests of the person being assured.[^9] But if Type B pragmatism were\ntrue, we'd expect to find cases of CLARIFICATION where it is common\nground that the speaker knows *p*, and yet a request for standards is in\norder, and no such cases seem to exist. Similarly, it's hard to imagine\ncircumstances where Holmes would offer a different answer if Lestrade\nrather than Watson asked the questions. And more generally, if two\nquestioners who each know that *p* ask whether S knows that *p*, it is\nhard to see how it could be apt to answer them differently.[^10] But if\nType B pragmatism about 'knows' were true, knowledge questions would\nhave these three properties, so it follows that Type B pragmatism about\n'knows' is false.\n\n### Objections and Replies\n\n*Objection*: The argument that Type B pragmatism implies that questions\ninvolving 'knows' should have the three properties assumes that correct\nanswers are true answers. But there are good Gricean reasons to think\nthat there are other standards for correctness.\n\n*Reply*: It is true that one of the arguments for thinking that Type B\npragmatism has this implication uses this assumption. But the other\nargument, the argument from analogy with indexicals and other terms for\nwhich Type B pragmatism is true, does not. Whatever one thinks of the\ntheory, there is data here showing that 'knows' does not behave in\nquestions like other context-sensitive terms for which Type B pragmatism\nis the most plausible view.\n\nMoreover, Type B pragmatists have to be very careful wielding this\nobjection. If there is a substantial gap between correct answers to\nknowledge questions and true answers, then it is likely that there is a\nsubstantial gap between correct knowledge ascriptions and true knowledge\nascriptions. As a general (though not universal) rule, truth and\ncorrectness are more tightly connected for questions than for simple\nstatements. For example, some utterances do not generate all the scalar\nimplicatures as answers to questions that they typically generate when\nasserted unprompted.[^11] But the primary 'ordinary language' argument\nfor Type B pragmatism about knowledge ascriptions assumes that correct\nknowledge ascriptions are, by and large, true.\n\nWe can put this in more theoretical terms. If we are to use these\nconsiderations to generate a *rebutting* defeater for Type B pragmatism,\nwe would need an argument that Holmes's answers are correct iff they are\ntrue. And while that step of the argument is plausible, it is not beyond\ncontention. But that isn't the only use of the examples. We can also use\nthem to *undercut* the argument from ordinary language to Type B\npragmatism. We have a wide range of cases where ordinary usage is as if\nType B pragmatism is false. And these cases are not peripheral or\nobscure features of ordinary usage. Answering questions is one of the\nmost common things we do with language. So ordinary usage doesn't\nprovide an all things considered reason to believe that Type B\npragmatism is true. If ordinary usage is (or at least was) the best\nreason to believe Type B pragmatism, it follows that there is no good\nreason to believe Type B pragmatism.\n\n*Objection*: Sometimes when we ask *Does S know that p?* all we want to\nknow is whether *S* has the information that *p*. In this mood,\nquestions of justification are not relevant. But Type B pragmatism is a\ntheory about the interaction between the subject's *justification* and\nknowledge ascriptions. So these questions are irrelevant to evaluating\nindexicalism.[^12]\n\n*Reply*: It is plausible that there is this use of knowledge questions.\nIt seems to me that this is a usage that needs to be explained, and\nisn't easily explained on current theories of knowledge.[^13] But I'll\nleave discussion of that use of knowledge questions for another day. For\nnow I'll just note that even if this can be an explanation of why we\nsometimes *assent* to knowledge questions, it can't be an explanation of\nwhy Holmes *denies* that Moriarty knows about the planned trap at Baker\nSt Station. Holmes agrees that Moriarty *believes* there is a trap\nplanned, but insists that because Moriarty is 'just guessing' that this\nbelief does not amount to knowledge. What really needs explaining is the\ndifference between Holmes's two answers, and this other use of knowledge\nquestions doesn't seem sufficient to generate that explanation.\n\n*Objection*: There is no explanation offered here for the data, and we\nshouldn't give up an explanatory theory without an explanation of why it\nfails.\n\n*Reply*: The best way to explain the data is to look at some differences\nin our attitudes towards questions containing 'knows' and questions\ncontaining other terms for which Type B pragmatism is plausibly true.\nI'll just go over the difference between 'knows' and 'ready', the point\nI'm making easily generalises to the other cases.\n\nDifferent people may be concerned with different bits of preparation, so\nthey may (speaker) mean different things by *X is ready*. But neither\nwill regard the other as making a *mistake* when they focus on a\nparticular bit of preparing to talk about by saying *X is ready*. And\nthis is true even if they think that the person *should* be thinking\nabout something else that X is preparing.\n\nKnowledge cases are not like that. Different people may have different\nstandards for knowledge, so perhaps they may (speaker) mean different\nthings by *A knows that p*, because they will communicate that *A* has\nmet their preferred standards for knowledge. But in these cases, each\nwill regard the other as making a *mistake*. Standards for knowledge\naren't the kind of thing we say people can differ on without making a\nmistake, in the way we do (within reason) say that different people can\nhave different immediate goals (e.g. about what to have for dinner)\nwithout making a mistake. That explains why we don't just adopt our\nquestioners standards for knowledge when answering their knowledge\nquestions.\n\n*Objection*: In section 2 it was argued that questions involving 'knows'\nshould have the three properties because questions involving other terms\nfor which Type B pragmatism is true have the properties. But this\nargument by analogy may be flawed. All those terms are 'indexical' in\nJohn MacFarlane's sense [@MacFarlane2009-MACNC]. That is, the *content*\nof any utterance of them varies with the context. But not all Type B\npragmatist theories are indexical, and this argument does not tell\nagainst a non-indexical Type B pragmatism.\n\n*Reply*: The view under consideration says that all utterances of '*S*\nknows that *p*' express the same proposition, namely that *S* knows that\n*p*. But the view is Type B because it says that proposition can be true\nrelative to some contexts and false relative to other contexts, just as\ntemporalists about propositions say that a proposition can be true at\nsome times and false at other times, and the utterance is true iff the\nproposition is true in the context of the utterance. This *is* a Type B\nview, and I agree that the argument by analogy in section 2 is powerless\nagainst it.\n\nBut that argument was not the only argument that Type B views are\ncommitted to questions involving 'knows' having the three properties.\nThere was also an argument, at the end of section 1, from purely\ntheoretical considerations. It turns out this argument is also\ncomplicated to apply here, but it does tell against this type of Type B\npragmatist as well.\n\nHere are two hypotheses about how one should answer a question *Does NP\nVP?* where NP is a noun phrase and VP a verb phrase. Consider the\nproposition expressed by the sentence *NP VP* in the speaker's context.\nFirst hypothesis: the correct answer is 'Yes' iff that proposition is\ntrue in the speaker's context. Second hypothesis: the correct answer is\n'Yes' iff that proposition is true in the respondent's context. If\npropositions do not change their truth value between contexts, these two\nhypotheses are equivalent, but on this version of Type B pragmatism that\nis not so, so we have to decide between them. The best way to do this is\nby thinking about cases where it is common ground that propositions\nchange their truth value between contexts, namely cases where the\ncontexts are possible worlds. Let's consider the scenario I briefly\ndiscussed above of the television watcher answering whatever question\ngets asked. Above I put the questioners in the same possible world as\nme, but we can imagine they are fictional characters in a different\npossible world. Imagine a show where it has just been revealed to the\naudience, but not all the characters, that the Prime Minister is a space\nalien. The following happens.\n\n> Character (on screen): Is the Prime Minister a space alien?\n>\n> Me (in real world): Yes!\n\nSince the proposition that the Prime Minister is a space alien is true\nin their world, but not in our world, the propriety of this response\ntells in favour of the first hypothesis above. Now this is not a\nconclusive argument, because it might be that there is some distinctive\nfeature of fiction that is causing this answer, even though the second\nhypothesis is in general correct. But it seems we have reason to think\nthat *if* this kind of Type B pragmatism were true, respondents would\nuse the speaker's context to work out what kind of answer to give. And\nas we saw above, this is not what respondents *actually* do, they either\nuse their own context or (more likely) the subject's.\n\n*Objection*: At most this shows that Type B pragmatism about 'knows' is\nnot actually true of English. But there might still be good\nepistemological reasons to adopt it as a philosophically motivated\nrevision, even if the data from questions shows it isn't true. So even\nif hermeneutic Type B pragmatism is false, revolutionary Type B\npragmatism might be well motivated.\n\n*Reply*: It's true that the philosophically most interesting concepts\nmay not map exactly on to the meanings of words in natural language.\n(Though I think we should be careful before abandoning the concepts that\nhave proven useful enough to get simple representation in the language.)\nAnd it's true that there are reasons for having epistemological concepts\nthat are sensitive to pragmatic factors. But what is hard to see is what\ninterest we could have in having epistemological terms whose application\nis sensitive to the interests of the person using them. @Hawthorne2004\nprovides many reasons for thinking that terms whose applications are\nsensitive to the interests of the person to whom they are being applied\nare philosophically and epistemologically valuable. Such terms provide\nways of expressing unified judgements about the person's intellectual\nand practical reasoning. On the other hand, there is little to be gained\nby *adopting* Type B pragmatism. If there needs to be a revision around\nhere, and my guess is that there does not, it should be towards Type A,\nnot Type B, pragmatism.\n\n[^1]: Note that the focus here is on the truth or falsity of the\n    utterance, and not on the truth or falsity of the proposition the\n    utterance expresses. I'm indebted to John MacFarlane for stressing\n    to me the importance of this distinction.\n\n[^2]: My own view is that if any pragmatic theory is true, it is Type A\n    pragmatism. In @Weatherson2005-WEACWD I defend the view that whether\n    an agent is sufficiently confident in *p* to count as believing that\n    *p* depends on features of her context. In contexts where it is very\n    important for practical deliberation whether *p* is true, a degree\n    of confidence that might ordinarily count as belief that *p* might\n    no longer so count. This is an odd kind of doxastic externalism,\n    namely the view that whether a state amounts to a *belief* is\n    environment-dependent. Now to know that *p* also requires having a\n    certain level of confidence that *p* is true, and it is arguable\n    (though I haven't argued it) that this level is also dependent on\n    the would be knowers environment. It is also arguable that the best\n    theory of epistemic *defeaters* will contain pragmatic features.\n\n    Though I describe Type C pragmatism as radical, I've been convinced\n    by John MacFarlane's work that it is a perfectly coherent doctrine.\n    In @Egan2005-EGAEMI we defend a version of Type C pragmatism for\n    sentences of the form *A might be F*, where *might* is understood\n    epistemically.\n\n[^3]: Whether the 'in general' is strictly necessary turns on tricky\n    considerations about non-standard usages, such as answering\n    machines. I'm generally favourable to the view that if any\n    qualification is needed it is a very small one. See\n    @Weatherson2002-WEAMI for more discussion of this point.\n\n[^4]: It is important here that we restrict attention to clarificatory\n    questions about the context, and in particular to features of the\n    context that (allegedly) affect the truth value of utterances\n    involving the indexical. Speakers can always ask for clarification\n    of all sorts of features of a question, but a question only has\n    CLARIFICATION if it is appropriate to ask for clarifying information\n    about the nature of the questioner's context.\n\n[^5]: The failure of NEGATIVE AGREEMENT for questions involving\n    quantifiers, comparative adjectives and similar terms is interesting\n    is interesting, and is something that a full semantic theory should\n    account for. My feeling is that the best explanation will draw on\n    the resources of a theory like that defended by @Stanley2000-STACAL\n    [@Stanley2002-STANR] but it would take us far away from our primary\n    purpose to explore this here. It is certainly an argument in favour\n    of the 'semantic minimalism' defended by @Cappelen2005 that all and\n    only the terms in their 'basic set' (apart from tense markers), i.e.\n    the obvious indexicals, generate questions with NEGATIVE AGREEMENT.\n    I think the fact that many terms generate questions with the\n    SPEAKER, CLARIFICATION and DIFFERENT ANSWERS property tells more\n    strongly against their view.\n\n[^6]: The Type A pragmatist says that it is the importance of the trap\n    to Moriarty that makes this a high-stakes question, and the Type C\n    pragmatist (at least as I understand that view) says that it is the\n    importance of the trap to Holmes that matters. Since Moriarty and\n    Holmes agree about what is important here, the Type A and Type C\n    pragmatists can agree with each other and disagree with the Type B\n    pragmatist.\n\n[^7]: The failure of NEGATIVE AGREEMENT for knowledge questions suggests\n    that if any contextualist theory is true, it had better be a single\n    scoreboard view.\n\n[^8]: As noted above, the Type A and Type C pragmatists agree with this\n    intuition, though for very different reasons.\n\n[^9]: With the right supplementary assumptions, I believe this claim can\n    be argued to be a consequence of any of our three types of\n    pragmatism.\n\n[^10]: The above remarks about cases where the speakers don't know that\n    *p* also apply. I think that without a very careful story about how\n    the norms governing assertion relate to the interests of the speaker\n    and the audience, such cases will not tell us much about the\n    semantics of 'knows'. Best then to stick with cases where it is\n    common ground that everyone, except the subject, knows that *p*.\n\n[^11]: Here are a couple of illustrations of this point. Yao Ming is\n    seven feet six inches tall. It would be odd (at best) to use (6) to\n    describe him, but it is clearly improper to answer (7) with 'No'.\n\n    For a second case, consider an example of Hart's that @Grice1989\n    uses to motivate his distinction between semantics and pragmatics. A\n    motorist drives slowly down the street, pausing at every driveway to\n    see if anyone or anything is rushing out. It seems extremely odd to\n    use (8) to describe him.\n\n    Is this oddity due to (8) being false, or it being otherwise\n    infelicitous? Part of the argument that (8) is true, but\n    infelicitous, is that intuitively it is correct to say 'Yes' in\n    response to (9), and incorrect to say 'No'.\n\n    The implicatures associated with (8) are largely absent from\n    affirmative answers to (9), though such an answer presumably has the\n    same truth-conditional content as (8).\n\n[^12]: A similar view is defended by Alvin @Goldman2002.\n\n[^13]: One explanation, due to Stephen @Hetherington2001, is that all\n    that is ever required for a *true* ascription of knowledge that *p*\n    to S is that *p* is true and S believe it. This leaves open the\n    question, as discussed below, of why we sometimes deny that true\n    believers are knowers, but we can bring out familiar Gricean\n    explanations about why we might usefully deny something that is\n    strictly speaking true, or we could follow Hetherington and offer an\n    explanation in terms of the gradability of knowledge claims. Another\n    possible explanation is that 'know' univocally means something like\n    what most epistemologists say that it means, but there is a good\n    pragmatic story about why speakers sometimes attribute knowledge to\n    those with merely true belief. (I don't know how such an explanation\n    would go, especially if Type B pragmatism is not true.) Finally, we\n    might follow Goldman and say the English word 'know' is ambiguous\n    between a weak and strong reading, and the strong reading has been\n    what has concerned epistemologists, and the weak reading just\n    requires true belief. Such an ambiguity would be a small concession\n    to Type B pragmatism (since it is the interests of the speaker that\n    resolve ambiguities) but we could still sensibly ask whether Type B\n    pragmatism is true of the strong reading.\n",
