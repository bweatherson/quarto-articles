It's\nexperience not reason that teaches that Arsenal ended last season with\n90 points and Chelsea with 79, it's reason not experience that teaches\n90 is greater than 79, and, arguably, it's the two together that teach\nthat Arsenal ended with more points than Chelsea. One useful\nclassification of philosophers is by the relative importance they assign\nto experience and reason in grounding what we know. Empiricists (on one\nreading of that term) play down reason, sometimes going so far as to\ndeclare that anything known by a means other than experience must be a\nmere matter of definition. Rationalists play reason up.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in the Times Literary Supplement\n</aside>\n\nChristopher Peacocke is firmly in the rationalist camp, and *The Realm\nof Reason* is an attempt to lay out what he takes rationalism to be. It\ngives his preferred version of rationalism and some arguments in its\nfavour. It's much too much to attempt in a short book and it isn't\nentirely persuasive on any of the applications, but it is a grand vision\nfor what a global rationalism might look like, one that might prove\nattractive even if the details need work. Given the length of the book a\nsurprising amount of time is spent on relatively abstruse details.\nPeacocke provides a particularly careful account of what distinguishes\nrationalists from empiricists and does a lot of work classifying and\nadjudicating between rationalisms of various strengths. These are the\nbest parts of the book, but also the least accessible.\n\nPeacocke's preferred version of rationalism has two distinctive\ncomponents. First, he focuses not on beliefs, as is usual, but on the\n\"transitions\" between representational states that occur in thought, as\nwhen we move to a new belief on the basis of one we already have. Mental\nrepresentational states are often beliefs, but they also include things,\nlike perceptions, that have representational content without necessarily\nbeing believed. Peacocke's rationalist claim is that for any justified\ntransition, there's an a priori explanation of why it is justified.\nSecond, he insists that this explanation rely crucially on the contents\nof the states involved in the transition.\n\nSo we get a quite strong \"foundationalist\" epistemology. Experience\nprovides the foundations for empirical knowledge, but how we get from\nthere to what we know is entirely in the domain of reason. It is\nfamously difficult to justify many steps by reason alone, and the most\npressing is the very first: How do we justify the transition from\nappearances to reality, such as the transition from *That looks crooked*\nto *That is crooked*? Some philosophers have thought that we need to\nlink appearance and reality so closely that the link is infallible.\nPeacocke doesn't take that line, so he has to justify the transition\nsome other way.\n\nDescartes faced a similar problem when trying to get over his radical\ndoubt about the existence of the material world, and solved it by appeal\nto God. We can tell a priori, he thought, that a benevolent God exists,\nand a benevolent God will not let us be deceived about this matter, at\nleast when we are careful enough to rely on clear and distinct\nperceptions. Now Descartes had to be careful here to only appeal to a\npriori reasons for belief in God. He couldn't, for instance, argue from\nthe apparent design of the universe to the existence of a designer,\nbecause we can't tell at this stage whether the apparent design is\nmerely an artifact of our defective perceptual faculties. Indeed, we\ncan't rely on any apparent fact about the external world until we've\ndetermined that appearances are a good guide to reality. So we need to\nargue for the existence of God without appeal to perception, and then\nuse God's existence to justify future reliance on perception.\n\nIn keeping with the spirit of the age, Peacocke updates Descartes's\nstrategy by replacing God with Darwin. Very roughly, Peacocke argues\nthat the best explanation of our having representative capacities at all\nis that we are the products of a long process of natural selection. And\nif we are the products of a long process of selection, then we probably\nhave accurate representations. If those two claims can be justified a\npriori we have an a priori argument to the (prima facie, probable)\naccuracy of our representations.\n\nLess roughly, Peacocke argues for a \"Complexity Reduction Principle\". We\nare entitled, on a priori grounds, to believe that complex phenomena\nhave explanations, and we are entitled to regard simpler explanations as\nmore probably true than more complex ones. That we have representations\nat all is a complex matter. How might it be explained? One explanation\nis via Divine creation. Another is that we are \"brains-in-vats\" living\nin a virtual reality world dreamt up by some quirky scientist (cf *The\nMatrix*). But neither of these explanations really reduces the\ncomplexity, since in each case we need to appeal to a thing (God, the\nscientist) that already has representational capacities. A simpler\nexplanation, allegedly, is that we are the product of natural selection\nand having accurate representations is selected for. This is certainly a\nnovel argument for Darwinism. It isn't why they teach natural selection\nto biology students. And of course it has flaws. Peacocke does little to\nshow that there are no better explanations of our having\nrepresentations. Nor does he address the question of how complicated\nhereditary mechanisms must be if they are to support natural selection.\nArguably they are much more complicated than is needed for\nrepresentation, so Darwin doesn't help reduce complexity here.\n\nSo it's not clear Peacocke's rationalism can get past step one; but\nlet's see what would happen next. To go beyond particular perceptions,\nin acquiring knowledge, we need induction. Peacocke takes the basic form\nof enumerative induction to be the (defeasible) inference from *All the\n(many and varied) observed Fs have been Gs* to *All Fs are Gs*. The\nobservation of only Gs, and no non-Gs, amongst these many and varied Fs\nis a complex fact, and its best (ie simplest) explanation is sometimes\nthat all the Fs are Gs. Peacocke argues that in these cases this\nexplanation is the a priori justification of the transition, and in only\nthese cases is the transition justified; he concludes that induction is\nacceptable by rationalist lights.\n\nThe chapter on induction is only fifteen pages long, and it really needs\nto be much longer. Peacocke sets out the position just outlined, and\ncompares it in some detail to a similar position advocated by Gilbert\nHarman, and that's it. There is no discussion of what we do when most,\nrather than all, the observed Fs have been Gs, even though that's surely\nthe more important practical case. There's no discussion of the case\nthat's frequently central to modern discussions on induction---the case\nin which a certain (stable) ratio of the Fs are Gs. Peacocke only talks\nabout the special case when *all* Fs are Gs, and it isn't obvious that\nthe discussion generalizes. There is no discussion of rationalist\nalternatives, such as Keynes's justification of enumerative induction in\nterms of analogical inference, or D. C. Williams's probabilistic defence\nof induction. And there's no discussion of empiricist attempts to\njustify induction a posteriori, or to do without it. Even if Peacocke's\nsuggested justification works, and it is at least a serious contender, a\npersuasive treatment of induction should have dealt with at least some\nof these points.\n\nThe final two chapters discuss moral beliefs. Again, Peacocke thinks\nthat all the inferences we make in order to get from our perceptual\nbeliefs to our moral beliefs can be justified a priori. His view is that\nwe can come to know a priori some moral principles. And we can know\ncontingent moral facts, such as that someone's giving £1000 to Oxfam is\nmorally praiseworthy, by carrying out the following inference. The\nperson, say Joe, helped other people in need. (We learn this by\nexperience.) Helping those in need is morally praiseworthy. (We learn\nthis moral principle by deploying our reason.) Hence what Joe did is\nmorally praiseworthy. But there's a problem here, and Peacocke never\nfully addresses it. It's only *prima facie* true that helping those in\nneed is morally praiseworthy. There are always exceptions to the\nprinciple. If Joe's children starved to death because that donation was\nthe last money Joe had to buy them food, the donation wasn't morally\npraiseworthy. Moreover, it is just about impossible to state the\nexceptions without using moral language. So it is far from clear how we\nare meant to come to know that this case is not one of the exceptions,\nbecause knowing this requires both empirical knowledge and moral\nsensitivity. From a \"principleist\" position like Peacocke's, knowing\nthis is not one of the exceptions seems just as hard as the original\nproblem of coming to know that the action was praiseworthy. So it seems\nthe rationalist still has work to do here.\n\nOne can easily get the feeling from this book that rationalism runs into\nproblems as soon as we try to apply it to real-world cases. But it isn't\nobvious these are deep problems with rationalism, and in particular it\nisn't clear that the problems can't be fixed with relatively minor\nadjustments. Even if there are difficulties in application throughout\n*The Realm of Reason*, there is a lot of important philosophical work\ngoing on beneath the surface. Peacocke's best work is done in\nclassifying the various types of rationalist position that are\navailable, and motivating the kind of view he wants to defend. This\nmaterial remains valuable, highly valuable to anyone wanting to draw a\nplausible rationalist picture, even if his real-world applications are\nnot yet perfect.\n",
