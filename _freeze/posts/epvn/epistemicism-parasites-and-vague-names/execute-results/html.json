Burgess's arguments are important, and largely correct, but there is a mistake in the discussion of one of the key examples. In this note I provide some alternative examples and use them to repair the mistaken section of the argument.\ndate: April 1 2003\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1093/ajp/jag209\"\ncategories:\n  - logic\n  - language\n  - vagueness\n  - notes\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1093/ajp/jag209\njournal:\n    title: \"Australasian Journal of Philosophy\"\n    publisher: \"Taylor and Francis\"\nvolume: 81\nnumber: 2\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: parasites.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nWhy is it so implausible that there is a sharp boundary between the rich\nand the non-rich? Perhaps we find it implausible merely because we\n(implicitly) believe that if there were such a boundary we would be able\nto discover where it is. If this is so we should revise our judgements.\nAs Timothy @Williamson1994-WILV [@Williamson2000-WILKAI] has shown, if\nthere were such a boundary we would *not* know where it is. Still, this\nis not the only reason for being sceptical about the existence of such a\nboundary. In \"Vagueness, Epistemicism and Response-Dependence\" John\n@Burgess2001 outlines an impressive objection to the existence of such\nboundaries, and in particular to epistemicist theories that posit their\nexistence. Burgess's objection is based not on principles about the\n*epistemology* of content, as the bad objection just stated is, but\nrather on principles about the *metaphysics* of content.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Australasian Journal of Philosophy* 81: 276-279.\n\nPicture by [Pacific Klaus](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41059842@N03) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/3dd50b73-bbb6-4184-b0c3-5cece916d9f9).\n</aside>\n\nIf a word *t* has content *c*, this must be the case in virtue of some\nmore primitive fact obtaining. Facts about content, such as this, are\nnot among the fundamental constituents of reality. Roughly, facts about\nlinguistic content must obtain in virtue of facts about use. But there\nare simply not enough facts about use to determine a precise meaning for\nparadigmatically vague terms like 'rich'. Any theory that holds that\n'rich' does have a precise meaning must meet this objection. As Burgess\nargues, Williamson's attempts to do this have not been entirely\nsuccessful. Burgess argues, persuasively, that epistemicists owe us a\ntheory of how terms like 'rich' get to have the precise meaning they\napparently have given that the facts about use do not seem to generate a\nprecise meaning. He also argues, less persuasively, that Williamson's\n'parasitic' strategy for meeting this obligation is unsuccessful.\nIndeed, the argument here rests at one point on a premiss that is\nclearly false. I will suggest a way to patch the argument and reinstate\nthe objection to epistemicism.\n\nThe obligation to provide a theory that generates content in terms of\nuse does not just fall on the epistemicists. We indeterminists about\ncontent must also discharge it. Assume that we have done so, and we have\na theory of content that divides sentences into (at least) the true, the\nfalse and the indeterminate. [@Williamson1994-WILV 207-208] argues that\nthe only reason we believe that any sentences fall into this third\ncategory is that we are respecting a mythical symmetry between truth and\nfalsity. We are falling into the trap of thinking that if a sentence is\nnot somehow made false, it is not false. The true story is that if an\nassertoric sentence has content, and it is not made true, it is*false*.\nThis provides the basis for Williamson's 'parasitic' strategy: wait for\nthe indeterminist to offer a theory of when sentences are true, accept\nthat part of the indeterminist theory, and say all other sentences that\nexpress propositions are false. If the strategy works, then there is no\nway the indeterminist can meet the obligation to provide a theory of\ncontent without the epistemicist also being able to do so, so there is\nno argument for indeterminism here. (There are complications, to put it\nmildly, with this strategy when the indeterminist allows the border\nbetween the true and the indeterminate to be vague. Burgess lets these\npotential problems slide, and so shall I.)\n\nThe strategy rests on the purported asymmetry between truth and falsity.\nBurgess claims that positing such an asymmetry makes epistemicism\ninconsistent. Consider a colour patch that is around the border between\nred and orange. Burgess claims, correctly, that an indeterminist theory\nof content may say that (1) and (2) are indeterminate, and hence\nWilliamson might be committed to the position that (1) and (2) are\nfalse, and hence so is (3).\n\n1.  That patch is red.\n\n2.  That patch is orange.\n\n3.  That patch is either red or orange.\n\nBut this is hopeless because \"on the epistemicist view, there is a sharp\nboundary in the series between red and orange; every patch is either one\nor the other.\" [@Burgess2001 519] This last claim is false. According to\nepistemicism, there is a sharp boundary between red and not red, so the\npatch is either red or not red. But the epistemicist need not hold that\nif the patch is not red, then it is orange. It is consistent with\nepistemicism that there are colours strictly between red and orange,\njust as it is consistent with epistemicism that there are colours\nstrictly between red and yellow, and just as it is consistent with\nepistemicism that there are colours strictly between red and blue. Hence\nit is possible that the colour of this patch is strictly between red and\norange, and thus is neither red nor orange. So this line of reasoning\ndoes not work. Perhaps the argument can be easily fixed. According to\nthe indeterminist, both (1) and (4) are indeterminate. Hence according\nto Williamson's 'parasitic' theory of content, both (1) and (4) are\nfalse, so (5) is false.\n\n1.  That patch is red.\n\n4.  That patch is not red.\n\n5.  That patch is either red or not red.\n\nThis is more like a problem, because Williamson certainly is committed\nto the truth of (5). However, it is easy to see how Williamson should\nrespond. The theory of content sketched above (or more precisely, the\nstrategy for converting indeterminist theories to determinist ones) was\nonly meant to apply to simple sentences. A *simple* sentence is true iff\nthe indeterminist says it is true. The truth value of *compound*\nsentences, like (4) and (5), is given by a standard Davidsonian theory\nof truth. Hence (1) is false and (4) is true, as required.\n\nThe best way to resurrect Burgess's argument is to shift our attention\nfrom vague predicates to vague names. Consider any mountain, say\nKilimanjaro. It is vague just where the mountain starts, so it will be\nvague just which atoms constitute Kilimanjaro. Kilimanjaro is some\nfusion of atoms or other, but it is indeterminate just which one it is.\nSome of these fusions have different masses, and some have different\nshapes, so no sentence of the form of (6) or of (7) will be true\naccording to the indeterminist.\n\n6.  Kilimanjaro has shape *s*.\n\n7.  Kilimanjaro has mass *m*.\n\nHence according to the Williamson's asymmetric theory of truth, any\nsentence of either of these forms is false. Note that this holds even if\nwe restrict the application of his theory to simple sentences. Now let\n*K* be a set of fusions of atoms {*f*~1~, *f*~2~, ..., *f~n~*} such that\nit is determinate that Kilimanjaro is one of these fusions. (Because of\nhigher-order vagueness it may be impossible to find such a set that does\nnot contain any fusion that is determinately not Kilimanjaro. That will\nnot matter; all that we require is that Kilimanjaro is one of these\nfusions.) Let *s~i~* be the shape of *f~i~* and *m~i~* its mass. Then\nfor all *i*, (6.*i*) and (7.*i*) are false, as we just argued.\n\n6.  i. Kilimanjaro has shape *s~i~*.\n\n7.  i. Kilimanjaro has mass *m~i~*.\n\nHence both (8) and (9) are false.\n\n8.  Kilimanjaro has shape *s*~1~ or Kilimanjaro has shape *s*~2~ or ...\n    or Kilimanjaro has shape *s~n~*.\n\n9.  Kilimanjaro has mass *m*~1~ or Kilimanjaro has mass *m*~2~ or ... or\n    Kilimanjaro has mass *m~n~*.\n\nAnd the epistemicist is committed to (8) and (9) being true. We may not\nbe able to discover which disjunct is true, but that is no reason to\nthink that the disjunction is not true. Burgess's argument was that if\nwe adopt Williamson's advice for constructing a theory of content, we\nwill misclassify sentences that express penumbral connections. He was\nbasically right, but we need to use a different example to prove it.\n\nI assumed above that Kilimanjaro is a fusion of atoms. Some may object\nto this on the grounds that Kilimanjaro has different temporal and modal\nproperties to any fusion of atoms. I doubt such objections ultimately\nwork, but for present purposes the important thing to note is that the\nargument can go through without such an assumption. Even if Kilimanjaro\nis not identical to any fusion in *K*, it is clear that Kilimanjaro\n(actually, now) exactly overlaps some member of *K*. And since\nKilimanjaro has the same (actual, present) shape and mass as any fusion\nof atoms it exactly overlaps, it still follows that (8) and (9) are\ntrue.\n\nIf we do assume that Kilimanjaro is one of the fusions, then we can\ngenerate another case where Williamson's theory generates false\npredictions. Since at most one of the fusions is a mountain, it follows\nthat (10.*i*) is indeterminate for all *i* on an indeterminist theory of\ncontent, and hence false according to Williamson.\n\n10.  i. *f~i~* is a mountain.\n\nHence his theory mistakenly predicts that (11) is false, when it is by\nhypothesis true.\n\n11.  *f*~1~ is a mountain or *f*~2~ is a mountain or ... or *f~n~* is a\n    mountain.\n\nThis argument does rest on a contentious bit of metaphysics, but it\nstill seems basically sound.\n\nI did not assume at any point that Kilimanjaro is a vague object. I did\nassume that 'Kilimanjaro' is a vague name, but it is consistent with the\nargument I have presented that there are no vague objects, and the\nvagueness in 'Kilimanjaro' consists in it being indeterminate which\nprecise object it denotes.\n\nAs Burgess demonstrates, it is fair to require that the epistemicist\nprovide a theory of how terms get the precise content they do.\nWilliamson attempted to show he was in just as good a position to\ndischarge this obligation as the indeterminist by providing an algorithm\nfor converting any indeterminist theory of content into one acceptable\nto the epistemicist. Burgess argued that the algorithm produced\nunacceptable results when we applied it to vague sentences such as (1)\nand (2). This particular argument is no good; the algorithm does not\nseem to produce implausible results in that case. We can make this form\nof argument work, however, especially if we focus on vague names.\nApplying the algorithm to any plausible indeterminist theory produces\nthe result that every disjunct in (8) and (9) are false, and hence that\nthese disjunctions are false. Since the epistemicist is (correctly)\ncommitted to these sentences being true, Burgess was correct to conclude\nthat \"this particular attempt to implement the parasite strategy is\ndoomed to failure.\"\n",
