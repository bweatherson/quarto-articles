I argue that his examples only refute a subclass of interest-relative theories. In particular, they are good objections to theories that say that what an agent knows depends on the stakes involved in the gambles that she faces. But they are not good objections to theories that say that what an agent knows depends on the odds involved in the gambles that she faces. Indeed, the latter class of theories does a better job than interest-invariant epistemologies of explaining the phenomena he describes.\ndate: January 1 2016\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.5840/jpr201663072\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - interest-relativity\n  - notes\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.5840/jpr201663072\njournal:\n    title: \"Journal of Philosophical Research\"\n    publisher: \"Philosophy Documentation Center\"\nvolume: 46\nnumber: 1\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: vials.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nIt isn't true that all interest-invariant epistemologies are alike, but\nit is certainly true that every interest-relative theory is\ninterest-relative in its own idiosyncratic way. In fact, there are at\nleast four dimensions along which a theory can be interest-relative.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Journal of Philosophical Research_ 46: 73-75.\n</aside>\n\nI used to think  [@Weatherson2005-WEACWD] that interest-relativity in\nknowledge was to be explained by interest-relativity in belief, but I\ncame to think that's not true  [@Weatherson2012-WEAKBI]. Some prominent\ndefenders of interest-relativity in epistemology focus on practical\ninterests -- it's even there in the title of the book by Jason\n@Stanley2005-STAKAP -- but others of us think that theoretical interests\nmatter too. At times Stanley writes as if interest-relativity means that\nthere is an extra clause in the theory of knowledge for interests, but\none need not think that. It could, for example, be that there is an\ninterest-sensitive domain restriction on a quantifier in one of the\nclauses.\n\nBut for present purposes, the key divide among interest-relative\nepistemologists is between those who think that stakes are relevant, and\nthose who think odds are relevant. I think, following Mark\n@Schroeder2012, that it is odds that matter. The key examples here are\nones where there is little cost to gambling and getting it wrong, but\neven less to gain by gambling and getting it right.\n\nSo imagine that Ankita is walking to a restaurant she hasn't been to for\na few months. She is stopped at the lights, reading baseball scores on\nher phone. She is almost, but not completely, certain that she should\nturn left at the next block, which indeed she should. If she had been\nwrong, she would have gone two blocks out of her way. She could avoid\nthis risk by flipping from her baseball app to the map on her phone and\nchecking the address, all of which she could do before the lights\nchange. I say that in this circumstance, she doesn't know where the\nrestaurant is. She should look up where it is, that's what maximises\nexpected utility, but she needn't look up restaurants she knows the\nlocation of. So she doesn't know whether the restaurant is to her left\nor her right. Ankita's case is not a high-stakes one. Even on a cold\nMichigan Fall evening, the downside of walking two extra blocks is not\nthat high. But unless she really really cares about those baseball\nscores she's browsing through, deciding not to flip over to the map is a\ngamble on the correctness of her plans at incredibly long odds. That's\nnot because the stakes are high, but because the gain from gambling is\nlow.\n\nThis is a genuine case of interest-relativity though. The argument I\njust gave wouldn't go through if Ankita would have no disutility\nwhatsoever from walking two blocks out of her way. (Maybe the exercise\ngain would completely outweigh the frustration.) In that case, perhaps\nshe does know. But if the two block walk has many times the disutility\nof no longer browsing baseball scores, as it would in most realistic\ncases, her interests defeat her knowledge of the restaurant location.\n\nThe same thing I think is going on in the example Thomas @Blackson2015\ngives. The agent has a three-way choice, between taking drug A, taking\ndrug B and doing nothing. The upsides of both drugs are the same; they\nalleviate a minor medical condition. The downsides are the same too;\nthey lead to death in rare cases. But this is much rarer still in the\ncase of B than A. So, says Blackson, the person should take drug B. And\nI agree. But, says Blackson, this is a problem, because I'm committed to\nthe following argument.\n\n1.  The agent knows that drug A and drug B won't kill them.\n\n2.  Any option an agent knows not to obtain can be left off a decision\n    table.\n\n3.  So, from 1 and 2, the decision table the agent faces has only the\n    upsides, and not the downsides.\n\n4.  So, from 3, the decision tables for the two drugs are the same.\n\n5.  So, from 4, the agent can be indifferent between the drugs.\n\nSince 5 is false, one of the premises must be false. Blackson says that\nthe false premise is 2. I say that it is 1; the patient doesn't know\ndrug A won't kill them. Blackson anticipates this, and says that the\nmove won't work because of a related case. If drug B didn't exist, the\ninterest-relative theorist might say that the agent has enough evidence\nto know the drug won't kill them. Maybe that's true, but it isn't clear\nwhy it is relevant. The existence of drug B changes the gamble involved\nin taking drug A. It must, since taking drug A is irrational in the\noriginal case, but rational in the version where drug B doesn't exist.\nSo if what the agent knows is sensitive to what gambles they face, then\nit isn't surprising that the presence of extra options changes what the\nagent knows.\n\nAnd the interest-relative theory has a nice explanation of one feature\nof Blackson's case. Imagine the agent learns that drug A is only ever\nfatal with people with blood type A2B negative, and that's not their\nblood type. There's no similarly known marking for when drug B is fatal.\nNow the agent can say, \"Now that I know drug A won't kill me, I'm going\nto take it, not drug B.\" That seems like just the right thing to say,\nbut on Blackson's telling of the case, they can't say it. After all,\nthey knew all along that drug A wouldn't kill them. Instead he has to\nsay that the agent shouldn't take drug A before they learn this, because\nof the risk it would kill them, even though the agent knows the drug\nwon't kill them. That doesn't sound at all right. Much better, I think,\nto say they shouldn't take drug A before learning who it endangers,\nbecause it exposes them to a needless risk of death, but once they know\nit won't kill them, it is good to take it.\n\nAnd that's the general strategy for defending interest-relative\ntreatments of cases like Blackson's, and the others he describes. It's a\nstrategy that I don't think is threatened by any example to date.\nThere's some action that all parties agree would be irrational, or at\nleast not rationally mandatory. But there's some evidence we can imagine\nthe agent getting that would improve the rational status of the action.\n(E.g., change it from being rationally impermissible to rationally\npermissible, or from not rationally required to rationally required.) If\nwe asked the rational agent why they changed their plans after getting\nthat evidence, it seems to make sense for them to say that they now know\nthe action would have a good outcome. That is, it makes sense for them\nto cite their knowledge as a reason for doing something different after\nthe evidence-gathering event. And only the interest-relative\nepistemologist can explain why that is a sensible answer for them to\ngive.\n\n\n\n",
