It is widely agreed that the simple theory will not work in some cases, but the counterexamples produced so far seem amenable to a more complicated contextualist theory. We argue, however, that no contextualist theory can capture the evaluations speakers naturally make of sentences containing epistemic modals. If we want to respect these evaluations, our best option is a *relativist* theory of epistemic modals. On a relativist theory, an utterance of *a might be F* can be true relative to one context of evaluation and false relative to another. We argue that such a theory does better than any rival approach at capturing all the behaviour of epistemic modals.\nauthor:\n  - name: Andy Egan\n    url: https://www.andyegan.net\n    affiliation: Rutgers University\n    affiliation_url: https://philosophy.rutgers.edu/\n  - name: John Hawthorne\n    url: https://www.acu.edu.au/research/our-research-institutes/dianoia-institute-of-philosophy/our-people/john-hawthorne\n    affiliation: Dianoia Institute of Philosophy\n    affiliation_url: https://www.acu.edu.au/research/our-research-institutes/dianoia-institute-of-philosophy\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-6340-0242\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndate: September 29 2005\ncategories:\n  - language\n  - relativism\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: flamethrower.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s David Lewis argued for a contextualist treatment of modals\n[@Lewis1976d; @Lewis1979f]. Although Lewis was primarily interested in\nmodals connected with freedom and metaphysical possibility, his\narguments for contextualism could easily be taken to support\ncontextualism about epistemic modals. In the 1990s Keith DeRose argued\nfor just that position [@DeRose1991; @DeRose1998].\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Contextualism in Philosophy_, edited by Gerhard Preyer and Georg Peter, 131-169.\n</aside>\n\nIn all contextualist treatments, the method by which the contextual\nvariables get their values is not completely specified. For\ncontextualist treatments of metaphysical modality, the important value\nis the class of salient worlds. For contextualist treatments of\nepistemic modality, the important value is which epistemic agents are\nsalient. In this paper, we start by investigating how these values might\nbe generated, and conclude that it is hard to come up with a plausible\nstory about how they are generated. There are too many puzzle cases for\na simple contextualist theory to be true, and a complicated\ncontextualist story is apt to be implausibly ad hoc.\n\nWe then look at what happens if we replace contextualism with\nrelativism. On contextualist theories the truth of an utterance type is\nrelative to the context in which it is tokened. On relativist theories,\nthe truth of an utterance token is relative to the context in which it\nis evaluated. Many of the puzzles for contextualism turn out to have\nnatural, even elegant, solutions given relativism. We conclude by\ncomparing two versions of relativism.\n\nWe begin with a puzzle about the role of epistemic modals in speech\nreports.\n\n### A Puzzle\n\nThe celebrity reporter looked discomforted, perhaps because there were\nso few celebrities in Cleveland.\n\n\"Myles\", asked the anchor, \"where are all the celebrities? Where is\nProfessor Granger?\"\n\n\"We don't know,\" replied Myles. \"She might be in Prague. She was\nplanning to travel there, and no one here knows whether she ended up\nthere or whether she changed her plans at the last minute.\"\n\nThis amused Professor Granger, who always enjoyed seeing how badly wrong\nCNN reporters could be about her location. She wasn't sure exactly where\nin the South Pacific she was, but she was certain it wasn't Prague. On\nthe other hand, it wasn't clear what Myles had gotten wrong. His first\nand third sentences surely seemed true: after all, he and the others\ncertainly *didn't* know where Professor Granger was, and she *had* been\nplanning to travel to Prague before quietly changing her destination to\nBora Bora.\n\nThe sentence causing all the trouble seemed to be the second: \"She might\nbe in Prague.\" As she wiggled her toes in the warm sand and listened to\nthe gentle rustling of the palm fronds in the salty breeze, at least one\nthing seemed clear: she definitely wasn't in Prague -- so how could it\nbe true that she might be? But the more she thought about it, the less\ncertain she became. She mused as follows: when I say something like *x\nmight be F*, I normally regard myself to be speaking truly if neither I\nnor any of my mates know that x is not *F*. And it's hard to believe\nthat what goes for me does not go for this CNN reporter. I might be\nspecial in many ways, but I'm not semantically special. So it looks like\nMyles can truly say that I might be in Prague just in case neither *he*\nnor any of *his* mates knows that I am not. And I'm sure none of them\nknows that, because I've taken great pains to make them think that I am,\nin fact, in Prague -- and reporters always fall for such deceptions.\n\nBut something about this reasoning rather confused Professor Granger,\nfor she was sure Myles had gotten something *wrong*. No matter how nice\nthat theoretical reasoning looked, the fact was that she definitely\nwasn't in Prague, and he said that she might be. Trying to put her\nfinger on just where the mistake was, she ran through the following\nlittle argument.\n\n1.  When he says, \"She might be in Prague\" Myles says that I might be in\n    Prague.[^1]\n\n2.  When he says, \"She might be in Prague\" Myles speaks truly iff\n    neither he nor any of his mates know that I'm not in Prague.\n\n3.  Neither Myles nor any of his mates know that I'm not in Prague.\n\n4.  If Myles speaks truly when he says that I might be in Prague, then I\n    might be in Prague.\n\n5.  I know I'm not in Prague.\n\n6.  It's not the case that I know I'm not in Prague if I might be in\n    Prague.\n\nThere must be a problem here somewhere, she thought -- for (1) -- (6)\nare jointly inconsistent. (Quick proof: (2) and (3) entail that Myles\nspeaks truly when he says, \"She might be in Prague\". From that and (1)\nit follows he speaks truly when he says Professor Granger might be in\nPrague. From that and (4) it follows that Professor Granger might be in\nPrague. And that combined with (5) is obviously inconsistent with (6).)\nBut wherein lies the fault? Unless some fairly radical kind of\nscepticism is true, Professor Granger can know by observing her South\nPacific idyll that she's not in Prague -- so (5) looks secure. And it\nseems pretty clear that neither Myles nor any of his mates know that\nshe's not in Prague, since they all have very good reason to think that\nshe is -- so it looks like (3) is also OK. But the other four premises\nare all up for grabs.\n\nWhich exactly is the culprit is a difficult matter to settle. While the\nsemantic theory underlying the reasoning in (1)-(6) is mistaken in its\ndetails, something like it is very plausible. The modal 'might' here is,\nmost theorists agree, an *epistemic* modal. So its truth-value should\ndepend on what someone knows. But who is this *someone*? If it is Myles,\nor the people around him, then the statement \"she might be in Prague\" is\ntrue, and it is unclear where to block the paradox. If it is Professor\nGranger, or the people around her, then the statement is false, but now\nit is unclear why a competent speaker would ever use this kind of\nepistemic modal. Assuming the *someone* is Professor Granger, and\nassuming Professor Granger knows where she is, then \"Granger might be in\nPrague\" will be true iff \"Granger is in Prague\" is true. But this seems\nto be a mistake. Saying \"Granger *might* be in Prague\" is a way to\nweaken one's commitments, which it could not be if the two sentences\nhave the same truth conditions under plausible assumptions. So neither\noption looks particularly promising.\n\nTo make the problem even more pressing, consider what happens if a\nfriend of Professor Granger's who knows she is in the South Pacific\noverhears Myles's comment. Call this third party Charles. It is prima\nfacie very implausible that when Myles says that Professor Granger might\nbe in Prague he means to rule out that *Charles* knows that she is not.\nAfter all, Charles is not part of the conversation, and Myles need not\neven know that he exists. So if Myles knows what he is saying, what he\nis saying could be true even if Charles knows Professor Granger is not\nin Prague. But if Charles knows this, Charles cannot regard Myles's\nstatement as true, else he will conclude that Professor Granger might be\nin Prague, and he knows she is not. So things are very complicated\nindeed.\n\nIn reasoning as we have been, we have been assuming that the following\ninferences are valid.\n\n7.  A competent English speaker says *It might be that S*; and\n\n8.  *S*, on that occasion of use, means that *p*; entail\n\n9.  That speaker says that it might be that *p*\n\nFurther, (9) plus\n\n10. That speaker speaks truly; entail\n\n11. It might be that *p*\n\nIf Charles accepts the validity of both of these inferences, then he is\nunder considerable pressure to deny that Myles speaks truly. And it\nwould be quite natural for him to do so -- for instance, by interrupting\nMyles to say that \"That's wrong. Granger couldn't be in Prague, since he\nleft on the midnight flight to Tahiti.\" But it's very hard to find a\nplausible semantic theory that backs up this intervention, although such\nreactions are extremely common. (To solidify intuitions, here is another\nexample: I overhear you say that a certain horse might have won a\nparticular race. I happen to know that the horse is lame. I think: you\nare wrong to think that it might have won.)[^2]\n\nOur solutions to this puzzle consist in proposed semantic theories for\nepistemic modals. We start with contextualist solutions, look briefly at\ninvariantist solutions, and conclude with relativist solutions. Although\nwe will look primarily at the costs and benefits of these theories with\nrespect to intuitions about epistemic modals, it is worth remembering\nthat they differ radically in their presuppositions about what kind of\ntheory a semantic theory should be. Solving the puzzles to do with\nepistemic modals may require settling some of the deepest issues in\nphilosophy of language\n\n### Contextualist Solutions\n\nIn his [-@DeRose1991], Keith DeRose offers the following proposal:\n\n> S's assertion \"It is possible that P\" is true if and only if (1) no\n> member of the relevant community knows that P is false, and (2) there\n> is no relevant way by which members of the relevant community can come\n> to know that P is false. (593-4)\n\nDeRose intends 'possible' here to be an epistemic modal, and the\nproposal is meant to cover all epistemic modals, including those using\n'might'.[^3] We will not discuss here the issues that arise under clause\n(2) of DeRose's account, since we'll have quite enough to consider just\nlooking at whether clause (1) or anything like it is correct.[^4]\n\nIn our discussion below, we consider three promising versions of\ncontextualist theory. What makes the theories contextualist is that they\nall say that Myles spoke truly when he said \"She might be in Prague\",\nbut hold that if Professor Granger had repeated his words she would have\nsaid something false.[^5] And the reason for the variation in\ntruth-value is just that Myles and Professor Granger are in different\ncontexts, which supply different relevant communities. Where the three\ntheories differ is in which constraints they place on how context can\nsupply the community in question.\n\nThe first is the kind of theory that DeRose originally proposed. On this\ntheory, there is a side constraint that the relevant community always\nincludes the speaker: whenever S truly utters *a might be F*, S does not\nknow that *a* is not *F*. We'll call this *the* *speaker-inclusion\nconstraint*, or sometimes just *speaker-inclusion*. There is some quite\ncompelling evidence for speaker-inclusion. Consider, for example, the\nfollowing sort of case: Whenever Jack eats pepperoni pizza, he forgets\nthat he has ten fingers, and thinks \"I might only have eight fingers.\"\nJill (who knows full well that Jack has *ten* fingers) spots Jack\nsitting all alone finishing off a pepperoni pizza, and says, \"He might\nhave eight fingers.\" Jill has said something false. And what she's said\nis false because it's not compatible with what *she* knows that Jack has\neight fingers. But if the relevant community could ever exclude the\nspeaker, one would think it could do so here. After all, Jack is clearly\ncontextually salient: he's the referent of 'he,' the fingers in question\nare on his hand, and no one else is around.[^6] Now, a single case does\nnot prove a universal[^7] -- but the case does seem to provide good\n*prima facie* vidence for DeRose's constraint.\n\nOne implication of DeRose's theory is that (1) is false, at least when\nProfessor Granger says it. For when Professor Granger reports that Myles\nsays \"She might be in Prague,\" she is reporting a claim he makes about\nhis epistemic community -- that her being in Prague is compatible with\nthe things that they know. But when she says (in the second clause) that\nthis means he is saying that she might be in Prague, she speaks falsely.\nFor in her mouth the phrase \"that I might be in Prague\" denotes the\nproposition that it's compatible with the knowledge of an epistemic\ncommunity that includes Professor Granger (as the speaker) that\nProfessor Granger is in Prague. And that is not a proposition that Myles\nassented to. So DeRose's theory implies that the very intuitive (1) is\nfalse when uttered by Granger.\n\n1.  When he says, \"She might be in Prague\" Myles says that I might be in\n    Prague.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing how counterintuitive this consequence of\nspeaker-inclusion is. If the speaker-inclusion constraint holds\nuniversally then in general speech involving epistemic modals cannot be\nreported disquotationally. But notice how natural it is, when telling\nthe story of Jack and Jill, to describe the situation (as we ourselves\ndid in an earlier draft of this paper) as being one where \"Whenever Jack\neats pepperoni pizza, he forgets that he has ten fingers, and thinks he\nmight only have eight.\" Indeed, it is an important generalization about\nhow we use language that speakers usually do not hesitate to disquote in\nreporting speeches using epistemic modals. So much so that exceptions to\nthis general principle are striking -- as when the tenses of the\noriginal speech and the report do not match up, and the tense difference\nmatters to the plausibility of the attribution.\n\nOne might try to explain away the data just presented by maintaining a\nlaxity for 'says that' reports. A chemist might say 'The bottle is\nempty' meaning it is empty of air, while milkman might utter the same\nsentence, meaning in my context that it is empty of milk. Nevertheless,\nthe milkman might be slightly ambivalent about denying:\n\n> When the chemist says 'The bottle is empty', she says that the bottle\n> is empty.\n\nAnd this is no doubt because the overt 'says that' construction\nfrequently deploys adjectives and verbs in a rather quotational way.\nAfter all, the chemist could get away with the following speech in\nordinary discourse: \"I know the milkman said that the bottle is empty.\nBut he didn't mean what I meant when I said that the bottle is empty.\nWhen he said that the bottle was empty he meant that it was empty of\nmilk.\"[^8] Thus the conventions of philosophers for using 'say that'\ninvolve regimenting ordinary use in a certain direction.[^9] But the\ndisquotational facts that we are interested in cannot be explained away\nsimply by invoking these peculiarities of 'says that' constructions, for\nthe same disquotational ease surrounds the relevant belief reports. In\nthe case just considered, while we might argue about whether it was\nacceptable for the chemist to say, in her conversational context, \"The\nmilkman said that the bottle was empty\", it is manifestly unacceptable\nfor her to say \"The milkman believes that the bottle is empty\". This\ncontrasts with the case of 'might': If someone asked Professor Granger\nwhere Myles thought she was, she could quite properly have replied with\n(12).\n\n12. He thinks that/believes that I might be in Prague.\n\nIndeed, we in general tend find the following inference pattern -- a\nbelief-theoretic version of (7) to (9) above -- compelling:\n\n1.  A competent English speaker sincerely asserts *It might be that S*\n\n2.  S, in that context of use, means that *p*.; therefore,\n\n3.  That speaker believes that it might be that *p*\n\nOur puzzle cannot, then, be traced simply to a laxity in the 'says that'\nconstruction.[^10] Whatever the puzzle comes to, it certainly runs\ndeeper than that.\n\nNotice that (12) does not suggest that Myles thinks that for all\nProfessor Granger knows, she is in Prague; it expresses the thought that\nMyles thinks that for all he knows, that is where she is. Moreover, this\nis hardly a case where Granger's utterance is of doubtful\nappropriateness: (12) is one of the ways canonically available for\nGranger to express that thought. But if we assume that what is reported\nin a belief report of this kind is belief in the proposition the\nreporter expresses by *I might be in Prague*, and we assume a\nbroad-reaching speaker-inclusion constraint, we must concede that the\nproposition Granger expresses by uttering (12) is that Myles believes\nthat for all *Professor Granger* knows, Professor Granger is in Prague.\n\nIf the speaker-inclusion constraint holds universally, then anyone\nmaking such a report is wrong. There are two ways for this to\nhappen---either they know what the sentences they're using to make the\nattributions mean, and they have radically false views about what other\npeople believe, or they have non-crazy views about what people believe,\nbut they're wrong about the meanings of the sentences they're using. The\nfirst option is incredibly implausible. So our first contextualist\ntheory needs to postulate a widespread semantic blindness; in general\nspeakers making reports are mistaken about the semantics of their own\nlanguage. In particular, it requires that such speakers are often blind\nto semantic differences between sentence tokens involving epistemic\nmodals. It is possible that some theories that require semantic\nblindness are true, but other things being equal we would prefer\ntheories that do not assume this.[^11] In general the burden of proof is\non those who think that the folk don't know the meaning of their own\nwords. More carefully: the burden of proof is on those who think that\nthe folk are severely handicapped in their ability to discriminate\nsemantic sameness and difference in their home language.\n\nSo the plausibility of (1) counts as evidence against the first\ncontextualist theory, and provides a suggestion for our second\ncontextualist theory. The cases that provide the best intuitive support\nfor the speaker-inclusion constraint and the case we used above,\ninvolved unembedded epistemic modals. Perhaps this constraint is true\nfor epistemic modals in simple sentences, but not for epistemic modals\nin 'that' clauses. Perhaps, that is, when S sincerely asserts *X Vs that\na might be F*, she believes that X Vs that for all X (and her community)\nknows, *a* is *F*. (This is not meant as an account of the logical form\nof *X Vs that a might be F*, just an account of its truth conditions. We\ndefer consideration of what hypothesis, if any, about the underlying\nsyntax could generate those truth conditions.) To motivate this\nhypothesis, note how we introduced poor Jack, above. We said that he\nthinks he might have eight fingers. We certainly didn't mean by that\nthat Jack thinks something about *our* epistemic state.\n\nThe other problem with the speaker-inclusion constraint is that it does\nnot seem to hold when epistemic modals are bound by temporal modifiers,\nas in the following example. A military instructor is telling his troops\nabout how to prepare for jungle warfare. He says, \"Before you walk into\nan area where there are lots of high trees, if there might be snipers\nhiding in the branches, clear away the foliage with flamethrowers.\"\nWhatever the military and environmental merits of this tactic, the\nsuggestion is clear. The military instructor is giving generic\nconditional advice: in any situation of type *S*, if *C* then do *A*.\nThe situation *S* is easy to understand, it is when the troops are\nadvancing into areas where there are high trees. And A, too, is clear:\nblaze 'em. But what about *C*? What does it mean to say that there might\nbe snipers in the high branches? Surely not that it's compatible with\nthe military instructor's knowledge that there are snipers in the high\nbranches -- he's sitting happily in West Point, watching boats sail\nlazily along the Hudson. What *he* thinks about where the snipers are is\nneither here nor there. Intuitively, what he meant was that the troops\nshould use flamethrowers if *they* don't know whether there are snipers\nin the high branches. (Or if they know that there *are*.) So as well as\nleading to implausible claims about speech reports, the\nspeaker-inclusion constraint seems clearly false when we consider\ntemporal modifiers.\n\nHere is a way to deal with both problems at once. There are constraints\non the application of the speaker-inclusion constraint. It does not\napply when the epistemic modal is in the scope of a temporal modifier\n(as the flamethrower example shows) and it does not apply when the\nepistemic modal is in a 'that' clause.[^12] Our second contextualist\ntheory then accepts the speaker-inclusion constraint, but puts\nconstraints on its application.\n\nThis kind of theory, with a speaker-inclusion constraint only applying\nto relatively simple epistemic modals, allows us to accept (1). The\nproblematic claim on this theory turns out to be (4):\n\n4.  If Myles speaks truly when he says that I might be in Prague, then I\n    might be in Prague.\n\nWhen Myles said that Professor Granger might be in Prague, he was\nspeaking truly. That utterance expressed a true proposition. So the\nantecedent of (4) is true. But the consequent is false: the \"might\" that\nappears there is not in a that-clause or in the scope of a temporal\nmodifier; so the speaker-inclusion constraint requires that Professor\nGranger be included in the relevant community; and since she knows that\nshe is not in Prague, it's not true that she might be. We would\nsimilarly have to reject:\n\n4.  If Myles has a true belief that I might be in Prague, then I might\n    be in Prague.\n\nBut there are reasons to be worried about this version of contextualism,\nbeyond the uneasiness that attaches to denying (4), and, worse still,\n(4$^\\prime$). For one, this particular version of the speaker-inclusion\nconstraint seems a bit *ad hoc*: why should there be just *these*\nrestrictions on the relevant community? More importantly, the theory\nindicts certain inferential patterns that are intuitively valid. Suppose\na bystander in our original example reasoned[^13]:\n\n13. Myles believes that it might be that Professor Granger is in\n    Prague.\n\n14. Myles's belief is true; therefore,\n\n15. It might be that Professor Granger is in Prague.\n\nBut this version of contextualism tells us that while (13) and (14) are\ntrue, (15) is false. In general, there are going to be counter-intuitive\nresults whenever we reason from cases where the speaker-inclusion\nconstraint does not apply to cases where it does.\n\nFinally, the theory is unable to deal with certain sorts of puzzle\ncases. The first kind of case directly challenges the speaker-inclusion\nconstraint for simple sentences, although we are a little sceptical\nabout how much such a case shows.[^14] Tom is stuck in a maze. Sally\nknows the way out, and knows she knows this, but doesn't want to tell\nTom. Tom asks whether the exit is to the left. Sally says, \"It might be.\nIt might not be.\" Sally might be being unhelpful here, but it isn't\nclear that she is *lying*. Yet if the speaker-inclusion constraint\napplies to unembedded epistemic modals, then Sally is clearly saying\nsomething that she knows to be false, for she knows that she knows which\nway is out.\n\nThis case is not altogether convincing, for there is something slightly\nawkward about Sally's speech here. For example, if Sally knows the exit\nis not to the left, then even if she is prepared to utter, \"It might be\n[to the left],\" she will not normally self-ascribe knowledge that it\nmight be to the left. And normally speakers don't sincerely assert\nthings they don't take themselves to know. So it is natural to suppose\nthat a kind of pretense or projection is going on in Sally's speech that\nmay well place it beyond the purview of the core semantic theory.\n\nThe following case makes more trouble for our second contextualist\ntheory, though it too has complications. Ann is planning a surprise\nparty for Bill. Unfortunately, Chris has discovered the surprise and\ntold Bill all about it. Now Bill and Chris are having fun watching Ann\ntry to set up the party without being discovered. Currently Ann is\nwalking past Chris's apartment carrying a large supply of party hats.\nShe sees a bus on which Bill frequently rides home, so she jumps into\nsome nearby bushes to avoid being spotted. Bill, watching from Chris's\nwindow, is quite amused, but Chris is puzzled and asks Bill why Ann is\nhiding in the bushes. Bill says\n\n16. I might be on that bus.\n\nIt seems Bill has, somehow, conveyed the *correct* explanation for Ann's\ndive---he's said something that's both true and explanatory. But in his\nmouth, according to either contextualist theory we have considered, it\nis not true (and so it can't be explanatory) that he might have been on\nthe bus. He knows that he is in Chris's apartment, which is not inside\nthe bus.\n\nChris's question, like most questions asking for an explanation of an\naction, was ambiguous. Chris might have been asking what *motivated* Ann\nto hide in the bushes, or he might have been asking what *justified* her\nhiding in the bushes. This ambiguity is often harmless, because the same\nanswer can be given for each. This looks to be just such a case. Bill\nseems to provide both a motivation and a justification for Ann's leap by\nuttering (16). That point somewhat undercuts a natural explanation of\nwhat's going on in (16). One might think that what he said was\nelliptical for *She believed that I might be on the bus*. And on our\nsecond contextualist theory, that will be *true*. If Bill took himself\nto be answering a question about motivation, that might be a natural\nanalysis. (Though there's the underlying problem that Ann presumably\nwasn't thinking about her mental states when she made the leap. She was\nthinking about the bus, and whether Bill would be on it.) But that\nanalysis is less natural if we think that Bill was providing a\njustification of Ann's actions.[^15] And it seems plausible that he\ncould utter (16) in the course of providing such a justification. This\nsuggests that (16) simply means that for all *Ann* knew, Bill was on\nthat bus. Alternatively, we could say that (16) is elliptical for\n*Because I might be on that bus*, and that the speaker-inclusion\nconstraint does not apply to an epistemic modal connected to another\nsentence by 'because'. This may be right, but by this stage we imagine\nsome will be thinking that the project of trying to find all the\nrestrictions on the speaker-inclusion constraint is a degenerating\nresearch program, and a paradigm shift may be in order.\n\nSo our final contextualist theory is that DeRose's original semantic\ntheory, before the addition of any sort of speaker-inclusion constraint,\nwas correct and complete. So 'might' behaves like 'local' and 'nearby'.\nIf Susie says \"There are snipers nearby,\" the truth condition for that\nmight be that there are snipers near Susie, or that there are snipers\nnear us, or that there are snipers near some other contextually salient\nindividual or group. Similarly, if she utters \"Professor Granger might\nbe in Prague\" the truth condition for that might be that for all she\nknows Professor Granger is in Prague, or that for all we know Professor\nGranger is in Prague, or that for all some other community knows,\nProfessor Granger is in Prague. There are no universal rules requiring\nor preventing the speaker from being included in the class of salient\nepistemic agents.\n\nAccording to the third version of contextualism, if Professor Granger\ndoes not equivocate when working through her paradox, then the problem\nlies with (6):\n\n6.  It's not the case that I can know I'm not in Prague if I might be in\n    Prague.\n\nAt the start of her reasoning process, Professor Granger's use of\n'might' means (roughly) 'is compatible with what Myles and his friends\nknow'. And if it keeps that meaning to the end, then the antecedent of\n(6) is true, because Professor Granger might (in that sense) be in\nPrague, even though she knows she is not. Any attempt to show that (1)\nthrough (6) form an inconsistent set will commit a fallacy of\nequivocation.[^16]\n\nBut (6) as uttered by Professor Granger sounds extremely plausible. And\nthere are other, more general problems as well. It is difficult on such\na theory to explain why it is so hard to get the relevant community to\nexclude the speaker in present tense cases: Why, for instance, can't\nJill's statement about Jack, \"He might have eight fingers,\" be a\nstatement about Jack's epistemic state rather than her own? The third\ntheory offers us no guidance.[^17]\n\nWe'll close this section with a discussion of the interaction between\nsyntax and semantics in these contextualist theories. As is well known,\nin the last decade many different contextualist theories have been\nproposed for various philosophically interesting terms. Jason\n@Stanley2000-STACAL has argued that the following two constraints should\nput limits on when we posit contextualist semantic theories.\n\nVariable\n\n:   Any contextual effect on truth-conditions that is not traceable to\n    an indexical, pronoun, or demonstrative in the narrow sense must be\n    traceable to a structural position occupied by a variable.\n    [@Stanley2000-STACAL 401][^18]\n\nSyntactic Evidence\n\n:   The only good evidence for the existence of a variable in the\n    semantic structure corresponding to a linguistic string is that the\n    string, or another that we have reason to believe is syntactically\n    like it, has interpretations that could only be accounted for by the\n    presence of such a variable.\n\nIf any contextualist theory of epistemic modals is to be justifiably\nbelieved, then **Variable** and **Syntactic Evidence** together entail\nthe existence of sentences where the 'relevant community' is bound by\nsome higher operator. So ideally we would have sentences like (17) with\ninterpretations like (18).\n\n17. Everyone might be at the party tonight.\n\n18. For all *x*, it is consistent with all *x* knows that *x* will be at\n    the party tonight.\n\nNow (17) cannot have this interpretation, which might look like bad news\nfor the contextualist theory. It's natural to think that if 'might'\nincludes a variable whose value is the relevant community, that variable\ncould be bound by a quantifier ranging over it. But if such a binding\nwere possible, it's natural to think that it would be manifested in\n(17). So **Variable** and **Syntactic Evidence** together entail that we\nought not to endorse contextualism about epistemic modals.\n\nThis argument against contextualism fails in an interesting way, one\nthat bears on the general question of what should count as evidence for\nor against a contextualist theory. The reason that any variable\nassociated with 'might' in (17) cannot be bound by 'everyone' is that\n'might' takes wider scope than 'everyone'. Note that (17) does not mean\n(19), but rather means (20).\n\n19. For all *x*, it is consistent with what we know that *x* will be at\n    the party tonight.\n\n20. It is consistent with what we know that for all *x*, *x* will be at\n    the party tonight.\n\nAs Kai von Fintel and Sabine Iatridou [-@vonFintel2003] have shown, in\nany sentence of the form *Every F might be G*, the epistemic modal takes\nwide scope. For instance, (21) has no true reading if there is at most\none winner of the election, even if there is no candidate that we know\nis going to lose.\n\n21. Every candidate might win.\n\nMore generally, epistemic modals take wide scope with respect to a wide\nclass of quantifiers.[^19] This fact is called the Epistemic Containment\nPrinciple by von Fintel and Iatridou. Even if there is a variable\nposition for the relevant community in the lexical entry for 'might',\nthis might be unbindable because the epistemic modal always scopes over\na quantifier that could bind it. If that's true then the requirement\nimposed by **Syntactic Evidence** is too strong. If the evidence from\nbinding is genuinely neutral between the hypothesis that this variable\nplace exists and the hypothesis that it does not, because there are no\ninstances of epistemic modals that take narrow scope with respect to\nquantifiers, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are these\nvariable places on the basis of other evidence.\n\nHaving said all that, there still may be direct evidence for the\nexistence of a variable position for relevant communities. Consider\nagain our example of the military instructor, reprinted here as (22).\n\n22. Before you walk into an area where there are lots of high trees, if\n    there might be snipers hiding in the branches use your flamethrowers\n    to clear away the foliage.\n\nAs von Fintel and Iatridou note, it is possible for epistemic modals to\ntake narrow scope with respect to generic quantifiers. That's exactly\nwhat happens in (22). And it seems that the best interpretation of (22)\nrequires a variable attached to 'might'. Intuitively, (22) means\nsomething like (23).\n\n23. Generally in situations where you are walking into an area where\n    there are lots of high trees, if it's consistent with *your party*'s\n    knowledge that there are snipers hiding in the branches use your\n    flamethrowers to clear away the foliage.\n\nThe italicised *your party* seems to be the semantic contribution of the\nunenunciated variable. We are *not* saying that the existence of\nsentences like (23) shows that there are such variables in the logical\nform of sentences involving epistemic modals.[^20] We just want to make\ntwo points here. First, if you are a partisan of **Syntactic Evidence**,\nthen (22) should convince you not to object to semantic accounts of\nepistemic modals that appeal to variables, as our contextualist theories\ndo. Second, we note a general concern that principles like **Syntactic\nEvidence** presupposes that a certain kind of construction, where the\ncontextually variable term is bound at a level like LF, is always\npossible. Since there are rinciples like the Epistemic Containment\nPrinciple, we note a mild concern that this presupposition will not\nalways be satisfied.\n\n### Invariantist Solutions\n\nThe most plausible form of invariantism about epistemic modals is that\nDeRose's semantics is broadly correct, but the relevant community is not\nset by context - it is invariably the world. We will call this position\n*universalism*. Of course when we say *a might be F* we don't normally\ncommunicate the proposition that no one in the world knows whether *a*\nis *F*. The analogy here is to pragmatic theories of quantifier domain\nrestriction, according to which when we say *Everyone is F*, we don't\ncommunicate the proposition that everyone in the world is *F*, even\nthough that is the truth condition for our utterance.\n\nThe universalist position denies (2) in Professor Granger's argument.\nMyles did not speak truly when he said \"Professor Granger might be in\nPrague\" because someone, namely Professor Granger, knew she was not in\nPrague. Although (2) is fairly plausible, it probably has weaker\nintuitive support than the other claims, so this is a virtue of the\nuniversalist theory.\n\nThe big advantage (besides its simplicity) of the universalist theory is\nthat it explains some puzzle cases involving eavesdropping. Consider the\nfollowing kind of case. Holmes and Watson are using a primitive bug to\nlisten in on Moriarty's discussions with his underlings as he struggles\nto avoid Holmes's plan to trap him. Moriarty says to his assistant,\n\n24. Holmes might have gone to Paris to search for me.\n\nHolmes and Watson are sitting in Baker Street listening to this. Watson,\nrather inexplicably, says \"That's right\" on hearing Moriarty uttering\n(24). Holmes is quite perplexed. Surely Watson knows that he is sitting\nright here, in Baker Street, which is definitely not in Paris. But\nWatson's ignorance is semantic, not geographic. He was reasoning as\nfollows. For all Moriarty (and his friends) know, Holmes is in Paris\nsearching for him. If some kind of contextualism is true, then it seems\nthat (24) is true in Moriarty's mouth. And, thought Watson, if someone\nsays something true, it's OK to say \"That's right.\"\n\nWatson's conclusion is clearly wrong. It's not OK for him to say \"That's\nright,\" in response to Moriarty saying (24). So his reasoning must fail\nsomewhere. The universalist says that where the reasoning fails is in\nsaying the relevant community only contains Moriarty's gang members. If\nwe include Holmes and Watson, as the universalist requires, then\nMoriarty speaks falsely when he says (24).\n\nThere are a number of serious (and fairly obvious) problems with the\nuniversalist account. According to universalism, the following three\nclaims are inconsistent.\n\n25. *x* might be *F*.\n\n26. *x* might not be *F*.\n\n27. Someone knows whether *x* is *F*.\n\nSince these don't *look* inconsistent, universalism looks to be false.\n\nThe universalist's move here has to be to appeal to the pragmatics. If\n(27) is true then one of (25) and (26) is false, although both might be\nappropriate to express in some contexts. But if we can appropriately\nutter sentences expressing false propositions in some contexts, then\npresumably we can inappropriately utter true sentences in other\ncontexts. (Indeed, the latter possibility seems much more common.) So\none could respond to the universalist's main argument, their analysis of\neavesdropping cases like Watson's, by accepting that Watson can't\n*appropriately* say \"That's right\" but he can *truly* say this. The\nuniversalist will have a hard time explaining why such a theory cannot\nwork, assuming, of course, that she can explain how her own pragmatic\ntheory can explain all the data.\n\nThe major problem here is one common to all appeals to radical\npragmatics in order to defend semantic theories. If universalism is true\nthen speakers regularly, and properly, express propositions they know to\nbe false.[^21] (We assume here that radical scepticism is *not* true, so\nsometimes people know some things.) Myles knows full well than *someone*\nknows whether Professor Granger is in Prague, namely Professor Granger.\nBut if he's a normal English speaker, this will *not* seem like a reason\nfor him to not say, \"Professor Granger might be in Prague.\" Some might\nnot think this is a deep problem for the universalist theory, for\nspeakers can be mistaken in their semantic views in ever so many ways.\nBut many ill regard it as a serious cost of the universalist claim.\n\nThis problem becomes more pressing when we look at what universalism\nsays about beliefs involving epistemic modals. Myles does not just say\nthat Professor Granger might be in Prague, he believes it. And he\nbelieves Professor Granger might not be in Prague. If he also believes\nthat Professor Granger knows where she is, these beliefs are\ninconsistent given universalism. Perhaps the universalist can once again\ninvoke pragmatics. It is not literally true in the story that Myles\nbelieves that Granger might be in Prague. But in escribing the situation\nwe use \"Myles believes that Granger might be in Prague,\" to\npragmatically communicate truths by a literal falsehood. This appeal to\na pragmatic escape route seems even more strained than the previous\nuniversalist claims.\n\nIn general, the universalism under discussion here seems to run up\nagainst a constraint on semantic theorising imposed by Kripke's Weak\nDisquotation Principle. The principle says that if a speaker sincerely\naccepts a sentence, then she believes its semantic value.[^22] If we\nhave some independent information about what a speaker believes, then we\ncan draw certain conclusions about the content of the sentences she\naccepts, in particular that she only accepts sentences whose content she\nbelieves. The universalist now has two options.[^23] First, she can say\nthat Myles here does accept inconsistent propositions. Second, she can\ndeny the Weak Disquotation Principle, and say that although Myles\nsincerely asserts, and accepts, \"Professor Granger might be in Prague\"\nhe doesn't really believe that Professor Granger might be in Prague.\nGenerally, it's good to have options. But it's bad to have options as\nunappealing as these.[^24]\n\n### Reporting Epistemic Modals\n\nOur third class of solutions will be relatively radical, so it's worth\npausing to look at the evidence for it. Consider again the dialogue\nbetween Moriarty, Holmes and Watson. Moriarty, recall, utters (24)\n\n24. Holmes might have gone to Paris to search for me.\n\nWatson knows that Holmes is in Baker Street, as of course does Holmes.\nIn the above case we imagined that both Watson and Holmes heard Moriarty\nsay this. Change the story a little so Holmes does not hear Moriarty\nspeak, instead when he comes back into the room he asks Watson what\nMoriarty thinks. Watson, quite properly, replies with (30).\n\n30. He thinks that you might have gone to Paris to search for him.\n\nThis is clearly not direct quotation because Watson changes the pronouns\nin Moriarty's statement. It is not as if Watson said \"He sincerely said,\n'Holmes might have gone to Paris to search for me.'\" This might have\nbeen appropriate if Holmes suspected Moriarty was speaking in code so\nthe proposition he expressed was very sensitive to the words he used.\n\nNor was Watson's quote a 'mixed' quote, in the sense of what happens in\n(31).[^25] The background is that Arnold always uses the phrase 'my\nlittle friend' to denote his Hummer H2, despite that vehicle being\nneither little nor friendly. No one else, however, approves of this\nterminology.\n\n31. Arnold: My little friend could drive up Mt Everest.\\\n    Chaz: Arnold believes his little friend could drive up Mt\n    Everest.[^26]\n\nWe've left off the punctuation here so as to not beg any questions, but\nthere is a way this could be an acceptable report if the fourth and\nfifth word, and those two words only, are part of a quotation. This is\nclearly not ordinary direct quotation, for Arnold did not think, in\nEnglish or Mentalese, \"His little friend could drive up Mt Everest.\"\nNevertheless, this is not ordinary indirect quotation. In ordinary\nspoken English Chaz's report will be unacceptable unless 'little friend'\nis stressed. The stress here seems to be just the same stress as is used\nin metalinguistic negation, as described in @Horn1989. Note the length\nof the pause between 'his' and 'little'. With an ordinary pause it\nsounds as if Chaz is using, not mentioning, 'little friend'. So it is\npossible *in principle* to have belief reports, like this one, that are\nneither strictly direct nor strictly indirect.[^27] Nevertheless, it\ndoes not seem like (30) need such a case. In particular, there need be\nno distinctive metalinguistic stress on 'might' in Watson's utterance of\n(30), and such stress seems to be mandatory for this mixed report.\n\nAssuming Moriarty was speaking ordinary English, Watson's report seems\nperfectly accurate. This is despite the fact that the relevant community\none would naturally associate with Watson's use of 'might' is quite\ndifferent to the community we would associate with Moriarty's use. When\nreporting speeches involving epistemic modals -- and the beliefs express\nby sincere instances of such speeches, speakers can simply *disquote*\nthe modal terms.\n\nAs is reasonably well known, there are many terms for which this kind of\ndisquoting report is impermissible. In every case, Guildenstern's report\nof Ophelia's utterance is inappropriate.\n\n32. Ophelia: I love Hamlet.\\\n    ...\\\n    Guildenstern: \\*Ophelia thinks that I love Hamlet.\\\n\n33. Guildenstern: What think you of Lord Hamlet?\\\n    Ophelia: He is a jerk.\\\n    ...\\\n    Rosencrantz: What does Ophelia think of the King?\\\n    Guildenstern: \\*She thinks that he is a jerk.\\\n\n34. Guildenstern: Are you ready to teach the class on contextualism?\\\n    Ophelia: I'm ready.\\\n    ...\\\n    Rosencrantz: Does Ophelia think she is ready to defend her\n    dissertation?\\\n    Guildenstern: \\*She thinks she is ready.\\\n\n35. (Guildenstern and Ophelia are on the telephone, Guildenstern is in\n    Miami, and Ophelia is in San Francisco)\\\n    Guildenstern: What do you like best about San Francisco?\\\n    Ophelia:There are lots of wineries nearby.\\\n    ...\\\n    Rosencrantz: Is it possible to grow wine in south Florida?\\\n    Guildenstern: \\*Ophelia thinks that there are lots of wineries\n    nearby.[^28]\n\nEven when the contextualist claim is not *obviously* true, as with\n'local' and 'enemy', disquotational reports are unacceptable after\ncontext shifts.\n\n36. (Brian is calling from Providence, Hud and Andy are in Bellingham)\\\n    Brian: When I get all this work done, I'll head off to a local bar\n    for some drinks.\\\n    Andy: How much work is there?\\\n    Brian: Not much. I should get to the bar in a couple of hours.\\\n    Hud: Hey, is Brian in town? Where's he going tonight?\\\n    Andy: \\*He thinks he'll be at a local bar in a couple of hours.\\\n\n37. The Enemy, speaking of us: The enemy have the advantage.\\\n    One of us: How are we doing?\\\n    Another of us: Someone just informed me that the enemy have the\n    advantage.\\\n\n38. (Terrell is an NFL player, and Dennis is his coach.)\\\n    Terrell: Why are you cutting me coach?\\\n    Dennis: Because you are old and slow.\\\n    (After this Terrell returns to academia. Kate and Leopold are\n    students in his department.)\\\n    Kate: Do you think Terrell would do well on our department ultimate\n    frisbee team?\\\n    Leopold: ??I'm not sure. Someone thinks he's old and slow.\n\nThis data provides us with the penultimate argument against the\ncontextualist theory of epistemic modals. We have already seen several\nsuch arguments.\n\nFirst, as seen through the difficulties with each of the options\ndiscussed in section 2, *any* version of contextualism faces serious\nproblems, though by altering the version of contextualism we are using,\nwe can alter what problems we have to face.\n\nSecond, there is nothing like the speaker-inclusion constraint for terms\nlike 'local' and 'enemy' for which contextualism is quite plausible.\nThis disanalogy tells against the contextualist theory of 'might'. With\nthe right stage setting (and it doesn't usually take very much), we can\nget 'local' and 'enemy' to mean *local to x* and *enemy of x* for pretty\nmuch any x we happen to be interested in talking about. At least for\n'bare' (unembedded) epistemic modals, the situation is markedly\ndifferent. We can't, just by making Jack salient, make our own knowledge\nirrelevant to the truth of our utterance of, for example, \"Jack might\nhave eight fingers.\" The only way we can make our knowledge irrelevant\nis if we are using this sentence in an explanation or justification of\nJack's actions.[^29]\n\nThird, there is a difference in behaviour between embedded and\nunembedded occurrences of epistemic modals. When epistemic modals are\nembedded in belief contexts, conditionals, etc., they behave\ndifferently---the speaker inclusion constraint seems to be lifted.\n(Think about belief reports and that military instructor case.) 'Local'\nand 'enemy' don't seem to show any analogous difference in their\nbehaviour between their bare and embedded occurrences.\n\nFourth, 'local' and 'enemy' don't generate any of the peculiar phenomena\nabout willingness to agree. If Myles (still in Cleveland), says\n\n39. Many local bars are full of Browns fans.\n\nProfessor Granger (still in the South Pacific), will not hesitate to say\n\"that's right\" (as long as she knows that many bars in Cleveland really\nare, as usual, full of Browns fans). The fact that the relevant bars\naren't local to *her* doesn't interfere with her willingness to agree\nwith (39) in the way that the fact that *she* knew that she wasn't in\nPrague interfered with her willingness to agree with Myles' claim that\nshe might be in Prague, or in the way that Watson's knowledge that\nHolmes was in London (should have) interfered with his willingness to\nassent to Moriarty's claim that Holmes might be in Paris.\n\nFifth, when there is a context shift, we are generally hesitant to\nproduce belief reports by disquoting sincerely asserted sentences\ninvolving contextually variable terms. This is what the examples (32)\nthrough (36) show. For a wide range of contextually variable terms,\nspeakers will quite naturally hesitate to make disquotational reports\nunless they are in the same context as the original speaker. Such\nhesitation is not shown by speakers reporting epistemic modals.\n\nThe sixth argument, that there is an alternative theory that does not\nhave these flaws, will have to wait until the next section. For now,\nlet's note that there are other words that seem at first to be\ncontextually variable, but for which disquotational reports seem\nacceptable.\n\n40. Vinny the Vulture: Rotting flesh tastes great.\\\n    John: Vinny thinks that rotting flesh tastes great.\\\n\n41. Ant Z: He's huge (said of 5 foot 3 141 lb NBA player Muggsy Bogues)\\\n    Andy: Ant Z thinks that Muggsy's huge.\\\n\n42. Marvin the Martian: These are the same colour (said of two colour\n    swatches that look alike to Martians but not to humans.)\\\n    Brian: Marvin thinks that these are the same colour.\n\nIn all three cases the report is accurate, or at least extremely\nnatural. And in all three cases it would have been inappropriate for the\nreporter to continue \"and he's right\". But crucially, in none of the\nthree cases is it *clear* that the original speaker made a mistake. In\nhis context, it seems Vinny utters a truth by uttering, \"Rotting flesh\ntastes great\", for rotting flesh does taste great to vultures. From Ant\nZ's perspective, Muggsy Bogues is huge. We assume here, a little\ncontroversially, that there is *a* use of comparative adjectives that is\nnot relativised to a comparison class, but rather to a perspective. Ant\nZ does not say that Muggsy is huge for a human, or for an NBA player,\nbut just relative to him. And he's right. Even Muggsy is huge relative\nto an ant. Note the contrast with (36) here. There's something quite odd\nabout Leopold's statement, which intuitively means that someone said\nTerrell is old and slow for a graduate student, when all that was said\nwas that he is old and slow for an NFL player.[^30] And, relative to the\nMartian's classification of objects into colours, the two swatches are\nthe same colour. So there's something very odd going on here.\n\nThe following *very* plausible principle looks like it is being\nviolated.\n\n**Truth in Reporting**\n\n:   If *X* has a true belief, then *Y*'s report *X believes that S*\n    accurately reports that belief only if in the context *Y* is in, *S*\n    expresses a true proposition.[^31]\n\nNot only do our three reports here seem to constitute counterexamples to\n**Truth in Reporting**, Watson's report in (30) is also such a\ncounterexample, if Moriarty speaks truly (and sincerely). One response\nhere would be to give up **Truth in Reporting**, but that seems like a\ndesperate measure. And we would still have the puzzle of why we can't\nsay \"and he's right\" at the end of an accurate report.\n\nAnother response to these peculiar phenomena would be to follow the\nuniversalist and conclude that Moriarty, Vinny, Ant Z and Marvin all\nbelieve something false. It should be clear how to formulate this kind\nof position: something tastes great iff every creature thinks it tastes\ngreat; something is huge iff it is huge relative to all observers; and\ntwo things are the same colour iff they look alike (in a colour kind of\nway) to every observer (in conditions that are normal for them). As we\nsaw, there are problems for the universalist move for epistemic modals.\nAnd the attractiveness of the other universal seems to dissipate when we\nconsider the cases from a different perspective.\n\n43. Brian: Cognac tastes great.\\\n    Vinny: Brian believes that cognac tastes great.\\\n\n44. Andy:He's huge (said of Buggsy Mogues, the shortest ever player in\n    the Dinosaur Basketball Association).\\\n    Tyrone the T-Rex: Andy believes that Buggsy's huge.\\\n\n45. John: These are the same colour (said of two colour swatches that\n    look alike to humans but not to pigeons).\\\n    Pete the Pigeon: John believes that these are the same colour.\n\nAgain, every report seems acceptable, and in every case it would seem\nstrange for the reporter to continue \"and he's right.\" The universalist\nexplanation in every case is that the original utterance is false. That\ncertainly explains the data about reports, but look at the cost! All of\nour utterances about colours and tastes will turn out false, as will\nmany of our utterances about sizes. It seems we have to find a way to\navoid both contextualism and universalism. Our final suggestions for how\nto think about epistemic modals attempt to explain all this data.\n\n### Relativism and Centred Worlds\n\nJohn @MacFarlane2003-MACFCA-2 has argued that believers in a\nmetaphysically open future should accept that the truth of an utterance\nis *relative* to a context of evaluation.[^32] For example, if on\nThursday Emily says, \"There will be a sea battle tomorrow\", the believer\nin the open future wants to say that at the time her utterance is\nneither determinate true nor determinately false. One quick objection to\nthis kind of theory is that if we look back at Emily's statement while\nthe sea battle is raging on Friday, we are inclined to say that she got\nit right. From Friday's perspective, it looks like what Emily said is\ntrue. The orthodox way to reconcile these intuitions is that the only\nsense in which Emily's statement is *indeterminate* on Thursday is an\n*epistemic* sense -- we simply don't know whether there will be a sea\nbattle. MacFarlane argues instead that we should simply accept the\nintuitions as they stand. From Friday's perspective, Emily's statement\nis determinately true, from Thursday's it is not. Hence the truth of\nstatements is relative to a context of evaluation.\n\nThere is a natural extension of this theory to the cases described\nabove. Moriarty's statement is true relative to a context *C* iff it is\ncompatible with what the people in *C* know that Holmes is in Paris. So\nin the context he uttered it, the statement is *true*, because it is\nconsistent with what everyone in his context knows that Holmes is in\nParis. But in the context of Watson's report, it is false, because\nWatson and Holmes know that Holmes is not in Paris.\n\nWe will call any such theory of epistemic modals a *relativist* theory,\nbecause it says that the truth of an utterance containing an epistemic\nmodal is *relative* to a context of evaluation. As we will see,\nrelativist theories do a much better job than contextualist theories of\nhandling the data that troubled contextualist theories. Relativist\ntheories are also plausible for the predicates we discussed at the end\nof the last section: 'huge', 'color' and 'tastes'. On such a theory, any\nutterance that *x tastes F* is true iff *x* tastes *F* *to us*.\nSimilarly, an utterance *x is huge* that doesn't have a comparison\nclass, as in (41) or (44), is true iff *x* is huge relative *to us*. And\n*Those swatches are the same color* is true iff they look the same\ncolour *to us*. The reference to us in the truth conditions of these\nsentences isn't because there's a special reference to us in the lexical\nentry for any of these worlds. Rather, the truth of any utterance\ninvolving these terms is relative to a context of evaluation, and when\nthat is *our* context of evaluation, *we* get to determine what is true\nand what is false. If the sentences were being evaluated in a different\ncontext, it would be the standards of that context that mattered to\ntheir truth.\n\nSo far we have not talked about the pragmatics of epistemic modals,\nassuming that their assertability conditions are given by their truth\nconditions plus some familiar Gricean norms. But it is not obvious how\nto apply some of those norms if utterance truth is contextually\nrelative, because one of the norms is that one should say only what is\ntrue.\n\nOne option is to say that utterance appropriateness is, like utterance\ntruth, relative to a context of evaluation. This is consistent, but it\ndoes not seem to respect the data. Watson might think that Moriarty's\nutterance is false, at least relative to his context of evaluation[^33],\nbut if he is aware of Moriarty's epistemic state he should think it is\n*appropriate*. So if something like truth is a norm of assertion, it\nmust be truth relative to one or other context. But which one?\n\nWe could say that one should only say things that are true relative to\nall contexts. But that would mean John's statement about the two\nswatches being the same colour would be inappropriate, and that seems\nwrong.\n\nWe could say that one should only say things that are true relative to\nsome contexts. But then Brian could have said, \"Rotting carcases taste\ngreat\" and he would have said something appropriate, because that's true\nwhen evaluated by vultures.\n\nThe correct norm is that one should only say something that's true when\nevaluated in the context you are in. We assume here that contexts can\ninclude more than just the speaker. If Vinny the Vulture is speaking to\na group of humans he arguably cannot say *Rotting flesh tastes great*.\nThe reason is that rotting flesh does not taste great to the group of\nspeakers in the conversation, most of whom are humans. This norm gives\nus the nice result that Myles's statement is appropriate, as is\nMoriarty's, even though in each case their most prominent audience\nmember knows they speak falsely.[^34]\n\nThis helps explain, we think, the somewhat ambivalent attitude we have\ntowards speakers who express epistemic modals that are false relative to\nour context, but true relative to their own. What the speaker said\nwasn't true, so we don't want to endorse what they said. Still, there's\nstill a distinction between such a speaker and someone who says that the\nsky is green or that grass is blue. That speaker would violate the\nproperly relativised version of the *only say true things* rule, and\nMyles and Moriarty do not violate that rule.\n\nAs MacFarlane notes, relativist theories deny **Absoluteness of\nUtterance Truth**, the claim that if an utterance is true relative to\none context of evaluation it is true relative to all of them. It is\nuncontroversial of course that the truth value of an utterance *type*\ncan be contextually variable, the interesting claim that relativists\nmake is that the truth value of utterance tokens can also be different\nrelative to different contexts. So they must deny one or more premises\nin any argument for **Absoluteness of Utterance Truth,** such as this\none.\n\n1.  **Absoluteness of Propositional Content**: If an utterance expresses\n    the proposition *p* relative to some context of evaluation, then it\n    expresses that proposition relative to all contexts of evaluation.\n\n2.  **Absoluteness of Propositional Truth Value**: If a proposition *p*\n    is true relative to one context in a world it is true relative to\n    all contexts in that world; therefore,\n\n3.  **Absoluteness of Utterance Truth**\n\nThis argument provides a nice way of classifying relativist theories.\nOne relativist approach is to say that Moriarty (or anyone else who\nutters an epistemic modal) says something different relative to each\ncontext of evaluation. Call this approach *content* *relativism*.\nAnother approach is to say that there is a single proposition that he\nexpresses with respect to every context, but the truth value of that\nproposition is contextually variable. Call this approach *truth*\n*relativism*. (So that the meaning of 'proposition' is sufficiently\nunderstood here, let us stipulate that we understand propositions to be\nthe things that are believed and asserted and thus, relatedly, the\nsemantic values of 'that'-clauses.)\n\nIt might look like some of our behaviour is directly inconsistent with\n*any* sort of relativism. Consider the following dialogue.\n\n46. Vinny: Rotting flesh tastes great\\\n    Vinny's brother: That's true.\\\n    John: That (i.e. what Vinny's brother said) is not true.\n\nIf what Vinny's brother is saying is that Vinny's utterance *Rotting\nflesh tastes great* is true in his context, then John is *wrong* in\nsaying that what Vinny's brother said isn't true. For it is true, we\nclaim, that *Rotting flesh tastes great* is true in Vinny's\ncontext.[^35] But this prediction seems unfortunate, because John's\nutterance seems perfectly appropriate in his context.\n\nThe solution here is to recognise a *disquotational* concept of truth,\nto go alongside the *binary* concept of truth that is at the heart of\nthe relativist solution.[^36] The binary concept is a relation between\nan tterance and a context of evaluation. Call this *true~B~*. So Vinny's\nutterance is true~B~ relative to his context, and to his brother's\ncontext, and false~B~ relative to John's context. One crucial feature of\nthe binary concept is that it is not a relativist concept. If it is true\nrelative to one context that an utterance is true~B~ relative to context\nC, it is true relative to all contexts that the utterance is true~B~\nrelative to context C. The disquotational concept is unary. Call this\n*true~T~*. As far as is permitted by the semantic paradoxes, it claims\nthat sentences of the form *S is true~T~* *iff S* will be true~B~\nrelative to any context (note here the primacy of truth~B~ for semantic\nexplanation) True~T~ is a relative concept. An utterance can be true~T~\nrelative to C and not true~T~ relative to C$^\\prime$. When an utterance\nis given the honorific *true* in ordinary discourse, it is the unary\nrelative concept true~T~ that is being applied. That explains what is\ngoing on in (46). Vinny's brother says that Vinny's utterance is\ntrue~T~. Relative to his context, that's right, since Vinny's utterance\nis true in his context. But relative to John's context, that's false,\nbecause an utterance is true~T~ relative to John's context iff it is\ntrue relative to John's context. So John spoke truly relative to his own\ncontext, so he spoke correctly. The important point is that assignments\nof truth~T~ are relative rather than contextually rigid, so they might\nbe judged true relative to some contexts and false relative to others.\n\nAlthough both truth relativism and content relativism can explain (46)\nif they help themselves to the distinction between truth~B~ and\ntruth~T~, there are four major problems for content relativism that seem\nto show it is not the correct theory.\n\nThe first problem concerns embeddings of \"might\" clauses in belief\ncontexts. Suppose Watson says,\n\n47. Moriarty believes that Holmes might be in Paris.\n\nOn the content relativist view, (47) will say, relative to Watson, that\nMoriarty believes that, as far as Watson knows, Holmes is in Paris. That\nwould be a crazy thing for Watson to assert. Suppose Watson is talking\nto Holmes. Then, relative to Holmes, Watson will have claimed that\nMoriarty believes that, as far as Holmes knows, Holmes is in Paris. That\nwould *also* be a crazy thing for Watson to assert. But, given what he's\njust overheard, it would be perfectly natural---and pretty clearly\n*correct*, so long as nothing funny is going on behind the scenes---for\nWatson to assert (47). A view that tells us that Watson's saying\nsomething crazy relative to everybody who's likely to be a member of his\naudience is in pretty serious conflict with our pretheoretical\njudgements about the case. (Enlarging the context to include both Holmes\nand Watson obviously doesn't help, either.)\n\nThe second problem concerns the social function of assertion. In\nparticular, it causes difficulties for an attractive part of the\nStalnakerian story about assertion, that the central role of an\nassertion is to add the proposition asserted to the stock of\nconversational presuppositions [@Stalnaker1978]. On the content\nrelativist view, it can't be that the essential effect of assertion is\nto add *the proposition asserted* to the stock of common\npresuppositions, because there's no such thing as *the* proposition\nasserted. There will be a different proposition asserted relative to\neach audience member. That's not part of an attractive theory. And it's\nnot terribly clear what the replacement story about the essential effect\nof assertion---about the fundamental role of assertion in\ncommunication---is going to be. It may be that there's a story to be\ntold about *assertability*---about when Moriarty is entitled to assert,\nfor example, \"it might be that Holmes is in Paris\"---but there's no\nobvious story about what he's *up to* when he's making that\nassertion---about what the assertion is supposed to accomplish. (And if\nyou think that appropriateness of assertion's got to be tied up with\nwhat your assertion's supposed to accomplish, then you'll be sceptical\nabout even the first part.)\n\nThe third problem concerns epistemic modals in the scope of temporal\nmodifiers. The content relativist has difficulties explaining what's\ngoing on with sentences like (48).\n\n48. The Trojans were hesitant in attacking because Achilles might have\n    been with the Greek army.\n\nOn the content relativist view, (48) will be false relative to pretty\nmuch everybody---certainly relative to everybody alive today. It's\ncertainly false that the Trojans were hesitant because, as far as *we*\nknow, Achilles was with the Greek army. (Or worse, because, as far as we\nknew *then*, Achilles was with the Greek army.) But, depending on how\nthe Trojan war went, (48) could be *true* relative to everybody.[^37]\n\nFinally, content relativism has a problem with commands. Keith's Mom\nsays:\n\n49. For all days *d*, you should carry an umbrella on d if and only if\n    it might rain on *d*.\n\nSuppose on Monday Keith checks the forecast and it says there's a 50%\nchance of rain. So he takes an umbrella. It doesn't rain, and on Tuesday\nhe wonders whether what he did on Monday was what his Mom said he\nshould. On the content relativist view, we get the following strange\nresult: on Monday, it would have been true to say that he was doing what\nhis Mom said he should, since at the time, the embedded clause expressed\na proposition that was true relative to him. Looking back on Tuesday,\nthough, it looks like he did what his Mom said he shouldn't, because now\nthe embedded clause expresses a proposition that's false relative to\nhim. But that's not right. He just plain did what his Mom told him to\ndo.\n\nThe same thing happens with the soldiers trying to follow the imperative\nissued as (22). Assume one of them attempts to follow the command by\nburning down some trees that seem to contain snipers. Relative to the\ntime she is doing the burning, she will be complying with the command.\nBut later, when it turns out the trees were sniper-free, she will not\nhave been following the command. If we assume there's an overarching\ncommand to not use flamethrowers unless explicitly instructed to do so,\nthen it will turn out that, as of *now*, she violated her orders *then*.\nBut that's not right. She just plain followed her orders.\n\nThere's a similar problem with the other terms about which relativism\nseems plausible. Consider the following commands:\n\n50. Don't pick fights with huge opponents.\n\n51. Stack all of the things that are the same color together.\n\n52. If it tastes lousy, spit it out.\n\nIt's possible to sensibly issue these commands, even in relevantly mixed\ncompany. And if we're going to get the right compliance conditions, we\ndon't want *content* relativism about great-tastingness, hugeness, and\nsame-coloredness here. When we hear a command like (52), we take (a) the\nsame command to have been issued to everybody, and (b) everybody to be\nfollowing it if we all spit out the things that taste lousy to us. On\nthe content relativist view, we've each gotten different commands, and\nthe philosopher who spits out the chunk of week-old antelope hasn't\ncomplied with the command that Vinny was given. This seems wrong.\n\nSo the content relativist theory has several problems. The truth\nrelativist theory does much better. Let us begin with the familiar\nnotion of a function from worlds to truth values. Call any such function\na Modal Profile. On the standard way of looking at things, propositions\n-- the objects of belief and assertion, the semantic values of\n'that'-clauses -- are, or at least determine a Modal Profile. The truth\nrelativist denies this. According to the truth-relativist, the relevant\npropositions are true or false not relative to *worlds*, but relative to\n*positions* within worlds---that is, they're true or false relative to\n*centered worlds*. (A centered world is a triple of a possible world, an\nindividual, and a time.) There's a few ways to formally spell out this\nidea. One is to replace talk of Modal Profiles with Centring Profiles,\ni.e. functions from *centred* worlds to truth values. Another is to say\nthat a centred world and proposition combine to determine a Modal\nProfile, so propositions determine functions from centred worlds to\nModal Profiles. Each of these proposals has some costs and benefits, and\nwe postpone discussion of their comparative virtues to an appendix. For\nnow we are interested in the idea, common to these proposals, that\npropositions only determine truth values relative to something much more\nfine-grained than a world. (We take no stand here on whether\npropositions should be *identified* with either Modal Profiles or\nCentering Profiles or functions from Centred Worlds to Modal Profiles).\n\nTruth relativism is not threatened by the four problems that undermine\ncontent relativism.\n\nAccording to truth relativism, Watson and Moriarty express the very same\nproposition by the words *Holmes might be in Paris*, so it is no\nsurprise that Watson can report Moriarty's assertive utterance by using\nthe very same words. Similarly, it is no surprise that if Moriarty has a\nbelief that he would express by saying *Holmes might be in Paris*,\nWatson can report that by (53).\n\n53. Moriarty believes that Holmes might be in Paris.\n\nAbove we noted that it's unlikely that Watson could use this to express\nthe proposition that for all *Watson* knows Holmes is in Paris. We used\nthat fact to argue that DeRose's constraint did not apply when an\nepistemic modal is inside a propositional attitude report. The truth\nrelativist theory predicts not only that DeRose's constraint should not\napply, but that a different constraint should apply. When one says that\n*a believes that b might be F*, one says that *a* believes the\nproposition *b might be F*. And *a* believes that proposition iff *a*\nbelieves it is consistent with what they know that *b* is *F*. And that\nprediction seems to be entirely correct. It is impossible for Watson to\nuse (53) to mean that Moriarty believes that for all Holmes knows he is\nin Paris, or that for all Watson knows Holmes is in Paris. This seems to\nbe an interesting generalisation, and while it falls out nicely from the\ntruth relativist theory, it needs to be imposed as a special constraint\non contextualist theories.\n\nSince there is a proposition that is common to speakers and hearers when\nan epistemic modal is uttered, we can keep Stalnaker's nice idea that\nthe role of assertion is to add propositions to the conversational\ncontext. Since propositions are no longer identified with sets of\npossible worlds we will have to modify other parts of Stalnaker's\ntheory, but those parts are considerably more controversial.\n\nThe truth relativist can also explain how (48) can be true, though the\nexplanation requires a small detour through the nature of psychological\nexplanations involving relativist expressions go.\n\n48. The Trojans were hesitant in attacking because Achilles might have\n    been with the Greek army.\n\nAll of the following could be true, and not because the things in\nquestion are rude, huge or great tasting for us.\n\n54. Marvin the Martian dropped his pants as the Queen passed by because\n    it would have been rude not to.\n\n55. Children are scared of adults because they are huge.\n\n56. Vultures eat rotting flesh because it tastes great.\n\nIn general it seems that the truth of an explanatory claim of the form,\n*X $\\varphi$ed because* *p* depends only on whether *p* is true in *X*'s\ncontext (plus whether the truth of *p* in *X's* context bears the right\nrelation to *X*'s $\\varphi$ing).. Whether or not *p* is true in *our*\ncontext is neither here nor there. Adults are not huge, rotting flesh\ndoes not taste great, and it is rude to drop one's pants as the Queen\npasses by, but (54)-(56) could still be true, and could all count as\ngood explanations. Similarly, (48) can be true because *Achilles might\nhave been with the Greek army* could be true relative to the Trojans.\n\nSimilarly, what it is to comply with a command is to act in a way that\nmakes the command true in the context of action. This is not a\nparticular feature of epistemic modals, but just a general property of\nhow commands involving propositions with centered-worlds truth\nconditions behave. If Don picks a fight with Pedro after Don has shrunk\nso much that Pedro is now relatively huge, he violates (50), even if\nPedro was not huge when the command was issued. And he still violates it\nfrom a later perspective when Pedro and Don are the same size. The\ngeneral point is that whether the command is violated depends on the\napplicability of the salient terms from the perspective of the person to\nwhom the command applies. Similarly, Keith does not violate his Mom's\ncommand if he takes an umbrella where *It might rain* is true in the\ncontext the action is performed. And this, of course, matches up\nperfectly with intuitions about the case.\n\nIt's a little tricky to say just which statement in Professor Granger's\noriginal hexalemma gets denied by the truth relativist. It all depends\nwhat we mean by *spoke truly*. If *Myles spoke truly* means that Myles\nsaid something true~T~, then (2) is false (relative to Granger's\ncontext), for its right-hand-side is true but its left-hand-side is\nfalse. If, on the other hand, it means he said something true~B~\nrelative to his own context, then (4) is false, for he did speak\ntruly~B~ relative to his context, but it's not the case that Professor\nGranger might be in Prague. This is awkward, but we might expect that\nany good solution to the paradox will be awkward.\n\n### Objections to Truth Relativism\n\nIt might be thought that the truth relativist has to deny **Truth in\nReporting,** but in fact this can be retained in its entirety provided\nwe understand it the right way. The following situation is possible on\nthe truth relativist theory. *X* has a belief that is true in her\ncontext, and *Y* properly reports this by saying *X believes that S*,\nwhere *S* in *Y*'s mouth expresses a proposition that is false in *Y*'s\nmouth in her context. But this is no violation of **Truth in\nReporting**. What would be a violation is if *X*'s belief was true in\n*Y*'s context, and still *Y* could report it as described here. But\nthere's no case where, intuitively, we properly report an epistemic\nmodal but violate that constraint. And the same holds for reports of\nuses of *huge*, *color* or *tastes*. Even if Vinny (truly) believes that\nrotting flesh tastes great, and the words \"Rotting flesh tastes great\"\nin John's mouth express a false proposition, John's report, \"Vinny\nbelieves that rotting flesh tastes great\" would only violate T**ruth in\nReporting** if Vinny's belief is still true in *John's* context. And it\nis not.\n\nGiven that the relativist has the concept of truth~T~, or as we might\nput it truth *simpliciter*, what should be done with it? The answer\nseems to be not much. We certainly shouldn't restate the norms of\nassertion in terms of it, because that will lead to the appropriateness\nof assertion being oddly relativised. Whether it was appropriate for\nVinny to *say* \"Rotting flesh tastes great,\" is independent of the\ncontext of evaluation, even if the truth of what he uttered is\ncontext-relative. (It would not at all be appropriate for him to have\nsaid \"Rotting flesh tastes terrible\" even though we should think he\nwould have said something true by that remark, and something false by\nwhat he actually said.) And the same thing seems to hold for\ngeneralisations about truth as the end of belief. It is entirely\nappropriate for Myles to *believe* that Granger might be in Prague,\nbecause it's true~B~ relative to his context. Relatedly, if knowledge is\ntied to truth~T~ rather than truth~B~, knowledge can't be the norm of\nassertion or end of belief.[^38] On the other hand, using truth~T~ we\ncan say that **Truth in Reporting** is true in the truth relativist\ntheory without reinterpreting it in terms of relative truth concepts.\nMoreover, we can invoke truth~T~ to explain why we got confused when\nthinking about the original puzzle: It is arguable that, even if we\nshould distinguish truth~T~ from truth~B~ in our semantic theorizing, we\naren't unreflectively as clear about that distinction as we might be. No\nwonder then that we get a little confused as we think about the Granger\ncase. We want to say Myles doesn't make a mistake. And we also want to\nsay \"That's wrong\" speaking of the object of his assertion and belief,\nand what's more, when we say that, we don't seem to be making a binary\nclaim about the relation between ourselves and what is believes. Once we\nclearly distinguish truth~T~ from truth~B~ things become clearly. Using\nthe disquotational notion, we can say 'That is false~T~ ', which is a\nmonadic claim, and not a binary one. The binary truth~B~ explains why\nthat claim is assertable (it is assertable because 'That is false~T~ '\nis truth~B~ at my context), but doesn't figure in the proposition\nbelieved. Meanwhile, the relevant notion of mistake -- that of an agent\nbelieving a proposition that is not true~B~ at her context, can only be\nproperly articulated once the distinction between the more explanatory\ntruth~T~ is carefully distinguished from the (arguably) conceptually\nmore basic truth~B.~\n\nOne final expository point. In general, truth relativism makes for\nirresolvable disputes. Let us say that two conversational partners are\nin deadlock concerning a claim when the following situation arises:\nThere is a pair of conversational participants, x and y, and a sentence\nS, under dispute, such that each express the same proposition (in the\nsense explained) by S but that S is true~B~ at each of the contexts x is\nin during the conversation, and false~B~ at each of the contexts y is in\nduring the conversation. Neither speaks past one another in alternately\nasserting and denying the same sentence, since each expresses the same\nproposition by it. And each asserts what they should be asserting when\neach says: What I say is truth~T~ and what the other says is false~T.,~\nsince each makes a speech that is true~T~ at the respective contexts. In\ngeneral, truth relativism about a term will lead one to predict deadlock\nfor certain conversations, traceable to the truth relativity of the\nterm. But in the case of 'might', it is arguable that conversation tends\nto force a situation where, even if at the outset, a 'might' sentence\nwas true relative to x and not to y (on account of the truth-relativity\nof the 'might' sentence), x and y will, in the course of engagement and\ndispute, be quickly put into a pair of contexts which do not differ with\nrespect to truth~B~ (unless the 'might' sentence contained other terms\nthat themselves made for deadlock). This is not merely because the\nconversational participants will, through testimony, pool knowledge\nabout the sentence embedded in the 'might' claim. It is in any case\narguable that the relevant community whose body of knowledge determines\nwhether a 'might' claim is true~B~ at a context always includes not just\nthat of the person at that context but also that of his conversational\npartners. In the special case of 'might', then, Truth Relativism may\nwell generate far less by way of deadlock than in other cases.\n\nThere are two primary objections to the truth relativist theory: it\ndoesn't quite handle all the cases and that it is too radical.\n\nThere are some cases that seem to tell directly against the truth\nrelativist position. Consider the case again of Tom and Sally stuck in a\nmaze. Sally knows the way out, but doesn't want to tell Tom. She says,\ninter alia, (57), and does not seem to violate any *semantic* norms in\ndoing so, even though she knows the exit is some other way.\n\n57. The exit might be that way.\n\nThis seems to directly contradict the relativist claim that the norm for\nassertion is speaking truly in one's own context. We suspect that what's\ngoing on here is that Sally is projecting herself into Tom's context.\nShe is, we think, merely trying to verbalise thoughts that are, or\nshould be, going through *Tom's* head, rather than making a simple\nassertion. As some evidence for this, note (as was mentioned above) that\nit would be wrong to take (57) as evidence that Sally believes the exit\nmight be that way, whereas when a speaker asserts that *p* that is\nusually strong evidence that she believes that *p*. It is unfortunate\nfor the relativist to have to appeal to something like projection, but\nwe think it is the simplest explanation of these cases that any theorist\ncan provide.\n\nThe idea that utterances have their truth value absolutely is\nwell-entrenched in contemporary semantics, so it should only be\noverturned with caution. And it might be worried that once we add\nanother degree of relativisation, it will be open to relativise in all\nsorts of directions. We are sensitive to these concerns, but we think\nthe virtues of the relativist theory, and the vices of the contextualist\nand invariantist theories, provides a decent response to them.\nInvariantist theories are simply implausible, and any contextualist\ntheory will have to include so many ad hoc conditions, conditions that\nseem to be natural consequences of relativism, that there are\nmethodological considerations telling in favour of relativism. (Let us\nbe clear: we are not recommending a general preference for relativism\nover contextualism in semantic theory. As we have been trying to make\nclear, for example, the case of 'might' is very different from, say, the\ncase of 'ready'.) It is (as always) hard to tell which way the balance\ntips when all these methodological considerations are weighed together,\nbut we think the relativist has a good case.\n\n### Appendix on Types of Content {#appendix-on-types-of-content .unnumbered}\n\nRobert Stalnaker has long promoted the idea that the content of an\nassertoric utterance is a set of possible worlds, or a function from\nworlds to truth values. This idea has been enormously influential in\nformal semantics, although it has come in for detailed criticism by\nvarious philosophers. (See especially @Soames1987 and @King1994\n[@King1995; @King1998].) But even philosophers who think that there is\nmore to content than a set of possible worlds would agree that\npropositions determine a function from worlds to truth values. Some\nwould agree that such a function exhausts the 'discriminatory role' of a\nproposition, although this depends on the (highly contestable)\nassumption that the role of propositions is to discriminate amongst\n*metaphysical* possibilities. Still, even philosophers who disagree with\nwhat Stalnaker says about the nature of propositions could agree that if\nall we wanted from a proposition was to divide up some metaphysical\npossibilities, propositions could be functions from worlds to truth\nvalues, but they think some propositions that divide up the metaphysical\npossibilities the same way should be distinguished.\n\nWe don't want to take sides in that debate, because our truth relativism\nmeans we are in conflict with even the idea that a proposition\ndetermines a function from worlds to truth values. To see this, consider\na sentence whose truth value is relative to a context of evaluation,\nsuch as *Vegemite tastes great*. The truth relativist says that this\nsentence should be evaluated as true from a context where people like\nthe taste of Vegemite (call this the Australian context) and should be\nevaluated as false from a context where people dislike this taste (call\nthat the American context) and both evaluations are correct (from their\nown perspective) even though the Australians and Americans agree about\nwhat the content of *Vegemite tastes great* is, and they are in the same\nworld. So there's just no such thing as *the* truth value of *Vegemite\ntastes great* in the actual world, so it does not determine a function\nfrom worlds to truth values. What kind of function does it determine\nthen?\n\nOne option, inspired by Lewis's work on *de se* belief, is to say that\nit determines a function from centred worlds to truth values. The idea\nis that we can identify a context of evaluation with a centred world,\nand then *Vegemite tastes great* will be true relative to a centred\nworld iff it is properly evaluated as true within that context.\nAlternatively, the content of *Vegemite tastes great* will determine a\nset of centred worlds, the set of contexts from which that sentence\nwould be evaluated as true. Just as propositions were traditionally\nthought to determine (or be) sets of possible worlds, properties were\ntraditionally thought to determine (or be) functions from worlds to sets\nof individuals.[^39] Now if we identify centred worlds with\n$\\langle$individual, world$\\rangle$ pairs, a function from worlds to\nsets of individuals just is a set of centred worlds.[^40] So the content\nof *Vegemite tastes great* could just be a **property**, very roughly\nthe property of being in a context where most people are disposed to\nfind Vegemite great-tasting.\n\nThis proposal has three nice features. First, even though the content of\n*Vegemite tastes great* is not, and does not even determine, a\nproposition as Stalnaker conceived of propositions, it does determine a\nproperty. So the proposal is not as radical as it might at first look.\nSecond, properties are the kind of thing that divide up possibilities.\nThe possibilities they divide are individuals, not worlds, but the basic\nidea that to represent is to represent yourself as being in one class of\npossible states rather than another is retained. The only change is that\ninstead of representing yourself as being in one class of worlds rather\nthan another, you represent yourself as being in one class of\n$\\langle$individual, world$\\rangle$ pairs rather than another. Third,\nthe proposal links up nicely with David Lewis's account of *de se*\nbelief, and offers some prospects for connecting the contents of beliefs\nwith the contents of assertions, even when both of these contents have\nceased to be propositions in Stalnaker's sense.[^41]\n\nBut there's a problem for this account. Consider what we want to say\nabout *Possibly Vegemite tastes great*, where context makes it clear\nthat the 'possibly' is a metaphysical modal. There's a trivial problem\nand a potentially deep problem for this account. The trivial problem is\nthat we know what the meaning of *possibly* is. It's a function that\ntakes propositions as inputs and delivers as output a proposition that\nis true iff the input proposition is true at an accessible world. If the\ncontent of *Vegemite tastes great* is a property rather than a\nproposition, then we have a type-mismatch. This is a trivial problem\nbecause it's a fairly routine exercise to convert the meanings of words\nlike *possibly* so they are the right kind of things to operate on what\nwe now take the meaning of *Vegemite tastes great* to be.\n\nThe deep problem is that when we go through that routine exercise, we\nget the wrong results. We don't want *Possibly Vegemite tastes great* to\nbe true in virtue of there being an accessible world where the people\n*there* like the taste of Vegemite. We want it to be true in virtue of\nthere being a world where Vegemite's taste is a taste that in this\ncontext we'd properly describe as great. And it's not clear how to get\nthat on the current story. To see how big a problem this is, consider\n(58), where the modal is meant to be metaphysical and have wide scope.\n\n58. Possibly everyone hates Vegemite but it tastes great.\n\nThat's true, on its most natural reading. But the content of *Everyone\nhates Vegemite but it tastes great* will be the empty set of centred\nworlds, for there is no centred world on which this is true. Now it's\nnot clear just what the meaning of *possibly* could be that delivers the\ncorrect result that (58) is true.\n\nSo we are tempted to consider an alternative proposal. Start with a very\nnatural way of thinking about why the relativist has to modify the\nStalnakerian story about content. The problem is that (even given a\ncontext of utterance) *tastes great* does not determine a property.\nRather, relative to any context of evaluation, i.e. centred world, it\ndetermines a property. That is, its content is (or at least determines)\na function from centred worlds to properties. So given our actual\ncontext, it determines the property of having a taste that people around\nhere think is great. Now properties combine with individuals to form\nStalnakerian propositions. So *tastes great* is a function from centred\nworlds to functions from individuals to sets of worlds. Hence *Vegemite\ntastes great* is a function from centred worlds to sets of worlds, the\nprevious function with the value for the 'individual' being fixed as\nVegemite.\n\nOur second option then is that in general that sentences containing\n'relative' terms like 'tastes' or 'huge' or 'might' determines a\nfunction from centred worlds to sets of worlds. This makes it quite easy\nto understand how (58) could work. *Possibly* type-shifts so that it is\nnow a function from functions from centred worlds to sets of worlds to\nfunctions from centred worlds to sets of worlds. It's fairly easy to say\nwhat this function is. If the content of *p* is (or determines) *f*, a\nfunction from centred worlds to sets of worlds, then the content of\n$\\lozenge p$ is (or determines) *g*, the function such that for any\ncentred world *c*, *w* ${\\in}$ *g*(*c*) iff for some *w*$^\\prime$\naccessible from *w*, *w*$^\\prime$ ${\\in}$ *f*(*c*). The core idea is\njust that we ignore the role of the centred worlds until the end of our\nsemantic evaluation, and otherwise just treat $\\lozenge$ as we'd treated\nit in traditional semantics. This is a rather nice position in many\nways, but there are two issues to be addressed.\n\nFirst, it is not clear that functions from centred worlds to sets of\nworlds are really kinds of content. They are not things that divide up\nintuitive possibilities, in the way that sets of individuals, and sets\nof $\\langle$individual, world$\\rangle$ pairs do. It's no good to say\nthat relative to a centred world a content is determined. That would be\nfine if we were content relativists, and we said the content was meant\nto be determined relative to a centred world. But as argued in the text\nthe content of *Vegemite tastes great* should be the same across various\ncontexts of evaluation. A better response is to say functions from\ncentred worlds to sets of worlds do determine a kind of content. For any\nsuch function *f*, we can determine the set of centred worlds\n$\\langle$*i*, *w*$\\rangle$ such that *w* ${\\in}$ *f*($\\langle$*i*,\n*w*$\\rangle$). These will be the centred worlds that the proposition is\ntrue at. It's not necessarily a problem that the proposition does *more*\nthan determine this set. (It's not an objection to King's account of\npropositions that on his theory propositions do more than determine a\nset of possibilities.)\n\nSecond, it isn't exactly clear how to fill out these functions when we\nget back to our core case: epistemic modals. It's easy to say what it is\nfor *Vegemite tastes great* to be true in a world relative to our\ncontext of evaluation; indeed we did so above. It's a lot harder to say\nwhat it is for *Granger might be in Prague* to be true in an arbitrary\nworld *w* relative to an arbitrary context of evaluation *c*. As a first\npass, we might say this is true in *w* iff for all the people in *c*\nknow, it is true in *w* that Granger is in Prague. But the problem is\nthat whenever *c* is not a centre in *w*, it's very hard to say just\nwhat the people in *c* know about *w*. Under different descriptions of\n*w* they will know different things about it. If *w* is described as a\nnearby world in which Granger is in Cleveland, they will know Granger is\nnot in Prague in *w*. If it is described as a nearby world in which\nMyles knows where Granger is they may not know anything about whether\nGranger is in Prague is in *w*, even if those descriptions pick out the\nsame worlds. Ideally we would cut through this by talking about their\n*de re* knowledge about *w*, but most folks have very little *de* *re*\nknowledge about other possible worlds. It's not clear this is a huge\nproblem though. Remember that a sentence containing an epistemic modal\nis meant to determine a function from centred worlds to functions from\nworlds to truth values. Provided we have a semantics that allows for\nsemantic indeterminacy, we can just say that the functions from worlds\nto truth values are partial functions, and they simply aren't determined\nwhen it's unclear what the people in *c* know about *w*. Or we can say\nthere's a default semantic rule such that *w* is not in *f*(*c*) (where\n*f* is the function determined by the sentence) whenever this is\nunclear. Since the sentences whose meanings are determined by these\nvalues of the function, like *Possibly Granger might be in Prague* are\nsimilarly vague, it is no harm if the function is a little vague.\n\nSo we have two options on the table for what kind of functions sentences\nmight determine if they don't determine functions from world to truth\nvalues. One option is that they determine functions from centred worlds\nto truth values, another that they determine functions from centred\nworlds to functions from worlds to truth values. Neither is free from\ncriticism, and the authors aren't in agreement about which is the best\napproach, so it isn't entirely clear what the best way to formally\nimplement truth relativism is. But it does not look like there are no\npossible moves here. Moving to truth relativism does not mean that we\nwill have to totally abandon the fruitful approaches to formal semantics\nthat are built on ideas like Stalnaker's, although it does mean that\nthose semantic theories will need to be modified in places.\n\n[^1]: Some of Professor Granger's thoughts sound a little odd being in\n    the present tense, but as we shall see, there are complications\n    concerning the interaction of tense with epistemic modals, so for\n    now it is easier for us to avoid those interactions.\n\n[^2]: Note that it also seems implausible to say that this is an\n    instance of *metalinguistic* negation, as discussed in @Horn1989.\n    When Charles interrupts Myles to object, the objection isn't that\n    the particular form of words that Myles has chosen is inappropriate.\n    The form of words is fine, and Myles' utterance would be completely\n    unobjectionable if Charles's epistemic state were slightly\n    different. What's wrong is that Myles has used a perfectly\n    acceptable form of words to say something that's false (at least by\n    Charles' lights---more on this later). We also think it's\n    implausible to understand the 'might' claims in question here as\n    claims of objective chance or objective danger.\n\n[^3]: We take the puzzle to be a puzzle about sentences containing\n    epistemic modal operators, however they are identified. We are\n    sympathetic with DeRose's [-@DeRose1998] position that many\n    sentences containing 'might' and 'possible' are unambiguously\n    epistemic, but do not wish to argue for that here. Rather, we simply\n    take for granted that a class of sentences containing epistemic\n    modal operators has been antecedently identified.\n\n    There are two differences between 'possible' and 'might'. The first\n    seems fairly superficial. Sentences where *might* explicitly takes a\n    sentence, rather than a predicate, as its argument are awkward at\n    best, and may be ungrammatical. *It is possible that Professor\n    Granger is in Prague* is much more natural than *It might be the\n    case that Professor Granger is in Prague*, but there is no felt\n    asymmetry between *Professor Granger is possibly in Prague* and\n    *Professor Granger might be in Prague*. We will mostly ignore these\n    issues here, and follow philosophical orthodoxy in treating\n    epistemic modals as being primarily sentence modifiers rather than\n    predicate modifiers. The syntactic features of epistemic modals are\n    obviously important, but we're fairly confident that the assumption\n    that epistemic modals primarily operate on sentences does not bear\n    any theoretical load here, and could be replaced if necessary.\n\n    The other difference will be relevant to some arguments that follow.\n    'Might' can interact with tense operators in a way that 'possible'\n    does not. *It might have rained* could either mean MIGHT (WAS it\n    rains) or WAS (MIGHT it rains), while *It possibly rained*\n    unambiguously means POSSIBLY (WAS it rains). It is often hard in\n    English to tell just which meaning is meant when a sentence contains\n    both tense operators and epistemic modals, but in Spanish these are\n    expressed differently: Puede haber llovido; Podría haber llovido.\n\n[^4]: There are three kinds of cases where something like DeRose's\n    clause (2) could be relevant.\n\n    First, Jack and Jill are in a conversation, and Jack knows *p* while\n    Jill knows *p* ${\\rightarrow \\neg}$ *Fa*. In this case intuitively\n    neither could truly say *a might be F* even though neither knows *a*\n    is not *F*.\n\n    Second, there are infinitely many mathematicians discussing Fermat's\n    Last Theorem. The first knows just that it has no solutions for\n    *n*=3, the second just that it has no solutions for *n*=4, and so\n    on. Intuitions are (unsurprisingly) weaker here, but we think none\n    of them could say *Fermat's Last Theorem* *might have solutions*,\n    because the group's knowledge rules this out.\n\n    Third, if *S* was very recently told that *a* is not *F*, but simply\n    forgot this, then intuitively she speaks falsely if she says *a\n    might be F*.\n\n    Fourth, if S has the materials for easily coming to know P from her\n    current knowledge, but has not performed the relevant inference,\n    then we might be inclined (depending on how easy the inferential\n    steps were to see and so on) to say that she is wrong to utter 'It\n    might be that not P'.\n\n    Rather than try and resolve the issues these cases raise, we will\n    stick to cases where the only thing that could make *a might be F*\n    false is that someone knows that *a* is not *F*.\n\n[^5]: She would also have violated some pragmatic principles by\n    knowingly using a third-person pronoun to refer to herself, but we\n    take it those principles are defeasible, and violation of them does\n    not threaten the truth-aptness of her utterance.\n\n[^6]: Notice that intuitions do not change if we alter the case in such\n    a way that Jack has a strange disorder that makes it very hard for\n    him to come to know how many fingers he has. Thus clause (2) of\n    Derose's analysis cannot do the work of the relevant side\n    constraint.\n\n[^7]: And see the case of Tom and Sally in the maze below for some\n    countervailing evidence.\n\n[^8]: Notice that this use prohibits the inference from: The speaker\n    said that the bottle was empty, to, The speaker expressed the\n    proposition/said something that meant that the bottle was empty.\n\n[^9]: We are grateful for correspondence with John MacFarlane here.\n\n[^10]: For what its worth, we also note that 'S claimed that P' has less\n    laxity (of the sort being discussed) than 'S said that P'.\n\n[^11]: Note that the negation of semantic blindness concerning some\n    fragment of the language is *not* the theory that speakers know all\n    the semantic equivalences that hold between terms in that fragment.\n    All we mean by the denial of semantic blindness is that speakers not\n    have false beliefs about the semantics of their terms.\n\n[^12]:  This theory looks like one in which propositional attitude\n    operators become monsters, since the content of *Jack thinks that\n    Jill might be happy* is naturally generated by applying the operator\n    *Jack thinks* to the proposition that *that Jill might be happy*\n    denotes when it is expressed in Jack's context. But this is not the\n    easiest, or obviously the best, way to look at the theory. For one\n    thing, that way of looking at things threatens to assign the wrong\n    content to *Jack thinks that Jill might have stolen my car*. The\n    content of *Jill might have stolen my car* in Jack's context is that\n    for all Jack knows, Jill stole Jack's car, which is not what is\n    intended. That is to say, thinking of propositional attitude\n    operators as monsters here ignores the special status of epistemic\n    modals in the semantics. It is better, we think, to hold that on\n    this theory epistemic modals are impure indexicals whose value is\n    fixed, inter alia, by their location in the sentence as well as\n    their location in the world. But even if this theory does not\n    *officially* have monsters, the similarity to monstrous theories is\n    worth bearing in mind as one considers the pros and cons of the\n    theory.\n\n    Thanks to Ernest Lepore for helpful discussions here.\n\n[^13]: What follows is a belief theoretic version of Charles' reasoning.\n\n[^14]:  A similar case to the following appears in [@Hawthorne2004 27].\n\n[^15]: Though the theory will allow for the truth of, \"I might *have\n    been* on that bus\" (since the epistemic modal clause doesn't occur\n    on its own, but in the scope of a temporal operator). So if we think\n    that (i) that's enough to do the justificatory and explanatory work,\n    and (b) Bill's utterance of \"I might be on that bus\" is best\n    understood as a clumsy stab at \"I might have been on that bus\", then\n    perhaps we can account for this kind of case using our second\n    contextualist theory. Two worries: First, it is a cost of the theory\n    that we have to reinterpret Bill's utterance in this way, as a\n    clumsy attempt to say something that the theory can accommodate.\n    Second, there might be cases where the interpretation is less\n    plausible: As a response to, \"Why is Ann getting ready to jump over\n    the hedge?\", \"I might have been on that bus\" sounds worse to us than\n    \"I might be on that bus\".\n\n[^16]: The same kind of equivocation can be seen in other arguments\n    involving contextually variable terms. Assume that Nomar lives in\n    Boston, Derek lives in New York, and Nomar, while talking about\n    Fenway Park in Boston says, \"I live nearby.\" Derek, at home in New\n    York, hears this on television and runs through the following\n    argument.\n\n    1.  In saying \"I live nearby\" Nomar says that he lives nearby.\n        (Plausible disquotational premise about 'nearby')\n\n    2.  Nomar speaks truly when he says \"I live nearby\" (Follows from\n        the setup)\n\n    3.  If Nomar speaks truly when he says \"I live nearby\" and in saying\n        \"I live nearby\" he says that he lives nearby, then he lives\n        nearby. (I.e. if he speaks truly then what he says is true.)\n\n    4.  If Nomar lives nearby, then he lives in New York (Since\n        everywhere that's nearby to Derek's home is in New York.);\n        therefore\n\n    5.  Nomar lives in New York\n\n    The right thing to say about this argument is that it equivocates.\n    Every premise has a true reading. Perhaps every premise is true on\n    its most natural reading, but the denotation of 'nearby' has to\n    change throughout the argument for every premise to be true. The\n    current view is that 'might' behaves like 'nearby', and that\n    Professor Granger's argument equivocates, like Derek's.\n\n[^17]: There also seems to be a past/future asymmetry about epistemic\n    modals which the third contextualist theory will have trouble\n    explaining. Consider this case involving past tense epistemic\n    modals. Romeo sees Juliet carrying an umbrella home on a sunny\n    afternoon. When he asks her why she is carrying an umbrella, she\n    replies \"It might have rained today.\" There's a scope ambiguity in\n    Juliet's utterance. If the epistemic modal takes wide scope with\n    respect to the tense operator, Juliet would be claiming that she\n    doesn't know whether it has rained today (implicating, oddly, that\n    this is why she now has an umbrella.) Or, as Juliet presumably\n    intends, the temporal operator could take wide scope with respect to\n    the epistemic modal. In that case Juliet says that it was the case\n    at some earlier time (presumably when she left for work this\n    morning) that it was compatible with her knowledge that it would\n    rain today. And that seems both true and a good explanation of her\n    umbrella-carrying.\n\n    It is much harder, if it is even possible, to find cases involving\n    future tense operators where the temporal operator takes wide scope\n    with respect to the pistemic modal. If S says, \"It might rain\n    tomorrow\", that seems to unambiguously mean that it's compatible\n    with S's *current* knowledge (and her community's) that it rains\n    tomorrow. For a more dramatic case, consider a case where two\n    people, Othello and Desdemona, have discovered that a giant\n    earthquake next week will destroy humanity. No one else knows this\n    yet, but there's nothing that can be done about it. This rather\n    depresses them, so they decide to take memory-wiping drugs so that\n    when they wake up tomorrow, they won't know about the earthquake.\n    Othello can't say, \"Tomorrow, humanity might survive,\" even though\n    it is true that tomorrow, for all anyone will know, humanity will\n    survive. If the temporal modifier could take wide scope with respect\n    to the epistemic modal, Othello's utterance could have a true\n    reading. But it does not. It's possible at this point that our\n    policy, announced in footnote 2, of ignoring issues relating to\n    DeRose's second clause will come back to haunt us. One possibility\n    here is that tomorrow it will still be false that humanity might\n    survive because it's not compatible with what people tomorrow know\n    and knew that humanity survives. We don't think that's what is going\n    on, but it's possible. Here's two quick reasons to think that the\n    problem is not so simple. First, if Othello and Desdemona commit\n    suicide rather than take the memory-wiping drugs, it will be\n    compatible tomorrow with all anyone ever knew that humanity\n    survives. But still Othello's speech seems false. Second, it's not\n    obviously right that what people ever knew matters for what is\n    epistemically possible now. Presumably at one stage Bill Clinton\n    knew what he had for lunch on April 20, 1973. (For example, when he\n    was eating lunch on April 20, 1973.) But unless he keeps meticulous\n    gastronomical records, this bit of knowledge is lost to humanity\n    forever. So there will be true sentences of the form *Bill Clinton\n    might have eaten x for lunch on April 20, 1973* even though someone\n    once knew he did not. Now change the earthquake case so that it will\n    happen in thirty years not a week, and no one will then know about\n    it (because Othello and Desdemona took the memory-wiping drugs and\n    destroyed the machines that could detect it). Still it won't be true\n    if Othello says, \"In thirty years, humanity might survive.\" This\n    suggests to us that some kind of constraints on epistemic modals\n    will be required. The existence of these constraints seems to refute\n    the 'no constraints' version of contextualism. It also undermines\n    the argument that the second version of contextualism is too ad hoc.\n    Once some constraints are in place, others may be appropriate.\n\n[^18]: We assume here, following Stanley, a 'traditional syntax\n    involving variables' [fn. 13]Stanley2000-STACAL. At least one of\n    us would prefer a variable-free semantics along the lines of\n    @Jacobson1999 Adopting such a semantics would involve, as Stanley\n    says, major revisions to the presentation of this argument, but\n    would not *clearly* involve serious changes to the argument. Most\n    contextualists happily accept the existence of variables so we do\n    not beg any questions against them, but see @Pagin2005 for an\n    important exception.\n\n[^19]: It is not entirely clear what the relevant class of quantifiers\n    is, although von Fintel and Iatridou have some intriguing\n    suggestions about what it might be.\n\n[^20]: As previously noted, we are not all convinced that semantics\n    *ever* needs to appeal to such variables, let alone that it does to\n    account for the behaviour of epistemic modals.\n\n[^21]: By \"express\" we will always mean \"semantically express\". We're\n    not concerned with, and hope not to commit ourselves to any views\n    about, for example, what's conveyed via various pragmatic processes.\n\n[^22]: Note that something like this had better be true if what it is to\n    believe *p* is to have a sentence that means *p* in one's 'belief\n    box'.\n\n[^23]: We assume that it is not a serious option to deny that we ever\n    accept unnegated epistemic modal sentences.\n\n[^24]: There also a technical problem with universalism that mirrors one\n    of the problems Stanley and Szabó [-@Stanley2000-STAOQD] raise for\n    pragmatic theories of quantifier domain restriction. Normally (28)\n    would be used to express a proposition like (29).\n\n    28. Every professor enjoys every class.\n\n    29. Every salient professor enjoys every class that s/he teaches.\n\n    Intuitively, by uttering (28) we express a proposition that contains\n    two restricted quantifiers. Let's accept, for the sake of the\n    argument, that a pragmatic theory of quantifier domain restriction\n    can sometimes explain why the quantifiers in the propositions we\n    express are more restricted than the quantifiers in the truth\n    conditions for the sentences we use. Stanley and Szabó argue that\n    such an explanation will not generalise to cover embedded\n    quantifiers where the quantifier domain in the proposition expressed\n    is bound to the outer quantifier. One such quantifier is the\n    quantifier over classes in (28). We will not repeat their arguments\n    here, but simply note that if they are correct, the universalist\n    faces a problem in explaining how we use sentences with embedded\n    epistemic modals that are (intuitively) defined with respect to a\n    community that is bound by a higher level quantifier. As we saw,\n    (22) provides an example of this kind of epistemic modal.\n\n[^25]: Earlier we used *speech* reports to illustrate the oddities of\n    epistemic modals inside propositional attitude ascriptions. There\n    are well-known difficulties with connecting appropriate speech\n    reports to the semantic content of what is said, as opposed to\n    merely communicated. (For some discussion of these, see @Soames2002\n    and @Cappelen1997.) We don't think those difficulties affect the\n    above arguments, where the evidence is fairly clear, and fairly\n    overwhelming. But matters get a little more delicate in what\n    follows, so we move to belief reports because they are more closely\n    tied to the content of what is believed.\n\n[^26]: In this case, as with all the belief reports discussed below, the\n    only evidence the reporter has for the report is given by the speech\n    immediately preceding it. We assume there is good reason from the\n    context to assume that the speakers are sincere.\n\n[^27]:  There are somewhat delicate questions about what a direct belief\n    report *means*, but we assume the notion is well enough understood,\n    even if we could not formally explicate what is going on in all such\n    reports.\n\n[^28]: We do not say that 'nearby' in a speech report could *never*\n    refer to the area near the location of the original speaker. Had\n    Rosencrantz asked a question about San Francisco, and Guildenstern\n    given the same response, that is presumably what it would have done.\n    We just say that it does not *automatically* refer back to that\n    area, and in some cases, like (35), it can refer to a quite\n    different area. 'Nearby' behaves quite differently in this respect\n    to 'near here', which always refers to the area near the reporter.\n\n[^29]: And then it would probably be more natural to say \"He might have\n    eight fingers,\" but that's possibly for unrelated reasons.\n\n[^30]: Or perhaps something more specific than that, such as that he is\n    old and slow for a player at his position.\n\n[^31]: One might also consider a 'says that' version of **Truth in\n    Reporting:** If *X* speaks true, then *Y*'s report *X says that S*\n    is accurate only if in the context *Y* is in, *S* expresses a true\n    proposition. This is more questionable, since it is questionable\n    whether 'says that' constructions must report what is semantically\n    expressed by a speech, as opposed to what is merely communicated.\n    See again the papers mentioned in footnote 25.\n\n[^32]: We are very grateful in this section to extensive conversations\n    with John MacFarlane. His [-@MacFarlane2003-MACFCA-2] was one of the\n    main inspirations for the relativist theory discussed here. His\n    (ms), which he was kind enough to show us a copy of while we were\n    drafting this paper, develops the argument for a relativist approach\n    to epistemic modals in greater detail than we do here. Mark Richard\n    also has work in progress that develops a relativist view on related\n    matters, which he has been kind enough to show us, and which has\n    also influenced our thinking.\n\n[^33]: We do not assume here that ordinary speakers, like Watson,\n    explicitly make judgments about the truth of utterances relative to\n    a context of evaluation, as such. They do make judgments about the\n    truth of utterances, and those judgments are made in contexts, but\n    they don't explicitly makes judgments of *truth relative to context\n    of evaluation*. One of the nice features, however, of the relativist\n    account is that it is possible to do an attractive rational\n    reconstruction of most of their views in terms of contexts.\n\n[^34]: Can we even say that someone speaks falsely here now that truth\n    and falsity is always relative to a context of evaluation? It turns\n    out we can, indeed we must, although the matter is a little\n    delicate. We return to this point below.\n\n[^35]: We assume here the vultures are talking mainly to other vultures,\n    and John is talking mainly to other humans.\n\n[^36]: We are grateful to John Macfarlane for helpful correspondence\n    that influenced what follows.\n\n[^37]: We don't take any stand here on just how the war went, if it\n    happened at all. The important point is that whether (48) is true\n    when said of a particular battle is a wide-open empirical question,\n    not one that can be settled by appeal to the semantics of *might*.\n    The content relativist says, falsely, that it can be thus settled.\n\n[^38]:  Arguably, then, one will have to distinguish (and posit an\n    ordinary conflation between) knowledge~T~ from knowledge~B,~ the\n    latter being needed to make good on the normative importance of\n    knowledge, the former being need to make sense of the validity of\n    the inference from knowing that p to p. Is trouble lurking here for\n    the truth relativist, especially given link between the truth~B~ of\n    'might' claims and facts about knowledge? We shall not pursue the\n    matter further here.\n\n[^39]:  Lewis preferred the theory on which properties were sets of\n    individuals, potentially from different worlds. This theory has\n    difficulties accounting for individuals that exist in more than one\n    world. And since properties exist in more than one world, and\n    properties have to be treated as individuals in some contexts (e.g.\n    when they are the subjects of predication) this is a serious\n    problem. Treating properties as functions from worlds to sets of\n    individuals removes this problem without introducing any other\n    costs. (See @Egan2004-JACSPA-2 for more details.)\n\n[^40]: Matters are a little more complicated when we introduce times\n    into the story. For purposes of this appendix we ignore all matters\n    to do with tense. As you'll see, the story is complicated enough as\n    it is, and this omission doesn't seriously affect the dialectic to\n    follow.\n\n[^41]: It might be that propositions just are whatever things are the\n    contents of assertions and beliefs, so we shouldn't say that the\n    contents of sentences like *Vegemite tastes great* are not\n    propositions. But they will be very different kinds of propositions\n    to what we are used to. Thanks here to John MacFarlane.\n",
