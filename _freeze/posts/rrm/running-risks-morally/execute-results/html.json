The defence is fairly simple—there is no wrong of moral recklessness. There is an intuitive argument by analogy that there should be a wrong of moral recklessness, and the bulk of the paper consists of a response to this analogy. A central part of my response is that if people were motivated to avoid moral recklessness, they would have to have an unpleasant sort of motivation, what Michael Smith calls “moral fetishism”.\ndate: January 1 2014\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1007/s11098-013-0227-2\"\ncategories:\n  - ethics\n  - games and decisions\n  - moral uncertainty\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-013-0227-2\njournal:\n    title: \"Philosophical Studies\"\n    publisher: \"Springer\"\nvolume: 167\nnumber: 1\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: bullfight.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\nThis paper is part of a project defending **normative externalism**.\nThis is the view that the most important norms concerning the guidance\nand evaluation of action and belief are external to the agent being\nguided or evaluated. The agent simply may not know what the salient\nnorms are, and indeed may have seriously false beliefs about them. The\nagent may not have any evidence that makes it reasonable to have true\nbeliefs about what the salient norms are, and indeed may have misleading\nevidence about them. But this does not matter. What one should do, or\nshould believe, in a particular situation is independent of what one\nthinks one should do or believe, and (in some key respects) of what\none's evidence suggests one should do or believe.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Philosophical Studies* 167: 141-163.\n\nPhoto by [Michel Osmont](https://www.flickr.com/photos/33062621@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/586098cb-d3c7-4ffb-8dd4-337cdc643172).\n</aside>\n\nThere are three important classes of argument relevant to the debate\nbetween normative externalists, in the sense of the first paragraph, and\nnormative internalists. One class concerns intuitions about cases. For\ninstance, we might try to defend normative externalism by arguing that\naccording to the internalist, but not the externalist, there is\nsomething bad about Huckleberry Finn's actions in helping Jim escape.\nNomy @Arpaly2002 uses this example as part of an argument for a\nsophisticated form of externalism. Another class concerns views about\nthe nature of norms. Internalists think that externalists have missed\nthe need for a class of subjective norms, that are sensitive to agents'\nviews about the good. Externalists think that the norms internalists put\nforward are incoherent, or do not meet the internalists's needs. I'll\ngesture at these arguments below, but they are made in much more detail\nin recent work by Elizabeth @Harman2013 responding to internalist\nproposals.\n\n<aside>\nI've discussed this paper with just about everyone I know. Thanks to Elizabeth Anderson, Rachael Briggs, Lara Buchak, Sarah Buss, Justin D'Arms, Tom Dougherty, Dmitri Gallow, Alex Guerrero, Elizabeth Harman, Scott Hershovitz, Ishani Maitra, Julia Markovits, Jill North, Timothy Schroeder, Andrew Sepielli, Ted Sider, Rohan Sud, Sigrún Svavarsdóttir and Julie Tannenbaum for suggestions that particularly improved the paper. \n</aside>\n\nBut there's a third class of argument where the internalist may seem to\nhave an edge. Internalists can argue that there is a wrong of moral\nrecklessness, and externalists cannot explain what is wrong about moral\nrecklessness. My response will be fairly blunt; I do not think moral\nrecklessness is wrong. But I'll start by trying to state the case for\nthe wrongness of moral recklessness as strongly as I can, including\nclarifying just what moral recklessness is, before moving onto a\nresponse on behalf of the externalist.\n\n<aside>\nThis paper was presented to the EDGe group at the University of Michigan and the philosophy department at Ohio State University, and I got valuable feedback at both of those presentations.\n</aside>\n\n### Moral Uncertainty {#moraluncertainty}\n\nSome of our moral opinions are pretty firmly held. Slavery really is\nwrong; rescuing drowning children is good; and so on. But others might\nbe more uncertain. To use an example I'll return to a lot, even a lot of\ncarnivores worry that it isn't obvious that killing animals to eat their\nflesh is morally permissible.\n\n<aside>\nThe paper also served as my inaugural lecture as the Marshall M. Weinberg Professor at the University of Michigan. Marshall has been a wonderful supporter of the University of Michigan for many years, and especially of its philosophy department, and this was a tremendous honour.\n</aside>\n\nWe might wonder whether this uncertainty should have practical\nconsequences. Uncertainty in general does have practical, and even\nmoral, consequences. If you're pretty sure the bridge is safe, but not\ncompletely certain, you don't cross the bridge. If you're only sorta\nkinda confident that an action won't kill any innocent bystanders, and\nthere is no compelling reason to do the action, it would be horribly\nimmoral of you to do it.\n\n<aside>\nAnd the paper was presented at the 2013 Bellingham Summer Philosophy Conference. This is close to the Platonic Ideal of a philosophy conference. I'm incredibly grateful to Ned Markosian, and to all of the people who work with him to make this conference happen every year. And I'm very happy to have been able to present this paper at the 2013 conference. \n\nSo to Marshall and to Ned, thanks.\n</aside>\n\n\nThere are (at least) two ways to be uncertain about the morally\nsignificant consequences of your action. You might know the moral\nsignificance of everyone who might be harmed by your action, but not\nknow how many of them will be harmed, or how seriously they will be\nharmed. Someone who habitually runs red lights is in this position. They\nknow there's an elevated risk that they'll kill another human this way,\nand they know the human they would kill is morally valuable.\nAlternatively, you might know who or what is affected by your action,\nbut not be sure of their moral status. The hesitant carnivore is like\nthis. They know that steak dinners require killing cows, but they aren't\nsure how morally significant the cows are.\n\nPerhaps that's a distinction without a difference though. In both cases,\nthe action results in a higher probability of something morally\nsignificant being killed. And, one might think, that's enough to give\nthe actor reason to pause before acting, and enough to give us reason to\ncondemn the action.\n\nAs may be clear from the introduction, that's not how I think of the\ncases. I think the distinction I just flagged is very important both\npractically and morally. Being uncertain about the physical consequences\nof your actions should matter both to what you do, and how you are\nassessed. The red light runner is immoral, even if she never actually\nharms anyone, because she endangers morally significant humans. But the\nmeat eater cannot be condemned on the same grounds. If she is wrong that\nmeat eating is morally acceptable, that would be one thing. But a mere\nprobability that meat eating is immoral should not change one's actions,\nor one's evaluations of meat eaters.\n\nNow I won't pretend this is a particularly intuitive view. In fact,\nquick reflection on a few cases may make it seem that it is extremely\nunintuitive. Let's look at three such cases.\n\n> **Cake**\\\n> Carla is baking a cake for a fundraiser. She wants to put some\n> sweetening syrup into the cake to improve its taste. She reaches for\n> an unmarked bottle, which she is pretty sure contains the sweetener\n> she wants. But then she remembers that last week she had some arsenic\n> in a similar bottle. She is pretty sure she threw the arsenic out, but\n> not exactly certain. As a matter of fact, the syrup in the bottle is\n> sweetener, not arsenic, but Carla isn't certain of this. What should\n> she do?\n\n> **Dinner**\\\n> Martha is deciding whether to have steak or tofu for dinner. She\n> prefers steak, but knows there are ethical questions around\n> meat-eating. She has studied the relevant biological and philosophical\n> literature, and concluded that it is not wrong to eat steak. But she\n> is not completely certain of this; as with any other philosophical\n> conculsion, she has doubts. As a matter of fact, Martha is right in\n> the sense that a fully informed person in her position would know that\n> meat-eating was permissible, but Martha can't be certain of this. What\n> should she do?\n\n> **Abortion**\\\n> Agnes is twelve weeks pregnant, and wants to have an abortion. She has\n> studied the relevant medical and philosophical literature, and is\n> pretty sure that foetuses at this stage of development are not so\n> morally significant as to make abortion wrong. But she is not\n> completely certain of this; as with any other philosophical\n> conclusion, she has doubts. As a matter of fact, Agnes is right in the\n> sense that a fully informed person in her position would know that\n> abortion was permissible, but Martha can't be certain of this. What\n> should she do?\n\nThe setup of the last two cases is a bit cumbersome in one key respect;\nI had to refer to what a fully informed person in Martha or Agnes's\nposition would know. I did this so as to not beg any questions against\nthe internalist. I would rather say simply that Martha and Agnes were\nsimply right in their beliefs. But I'm not sure how to make sense of\nthis from an internalist perspective. If what's right to do is a\nfunction of your moral evidence and beliefs, perhaps there is a sense in\nwhich meat-eating or abortion is objectively permissible, but Martha and\nAgnes can't truly believe it is permissible, since it isn't permissible\nin their subjective state, and that's the really important kind of\npermissibility. So the retreat to talking about what a fully informed\nperson would know is my attempt to find an objective point at which the\ninternalist and externalist can agree. It doesn't signal that I think\nthere's anything special about fully informed agents; I'm just trying to\navoid being question-begging here.\n\nYou might also think that one or other of these cases is very far\nremoved from reality. Perhaps what counts as meat or a foetus would have\nto be very different for these cases to be possible, perhaps so\ndifferent that they wouldn't deserve the label 'meat' or 'foetus'. I\ndon't think this should worry us. I don't particularly care if the cases\nare metaphysically possible or not. There's a world, epistemically if\nnot metaphysically possible, where the medical and biological facts are\nas they are and meat-eating and abortion are permissible, and that's the\nworld I mean these examples to be set in. By allowing that my thought\nexperiments may well be set in metaphysically impossible worlds, I am\ngoing against some recent views on thought experiments as put forward\nby, e.g, Timothy @Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 and Anna-Sara @Malmgren2011,\nbut it would take us too far afield to defend this bit of apostasy.\nInstead, I'll just use the cases as they are.\n\nFinally, note that I've set up the cases where the protagonists are\nalmost, but not entirely, sure of something that is in fact true. And\nI'm going to argue in the moral case that they should act as if they are\nright. That's not because I think that a view one is almost sure of\nshould be acted on; one should act on the moral truths, and Agnes and\nMartha are close to certain of the actual truth. The reason for picking\nthese cases is that they make the issue of recklessness most salient. If\nany of the three women do anything wrong (and I think Carla does) it is\nonly because they are reckless.\n\nThat said, there is something interestingly in common to the three\ncases. In each case, the agent has a choice that is, if taken freely,\nclearly morally acceptable. Carla can leave out the syrup, Agnes can\ncontinue the pregnancy, and Martha can order the tofu. At least, that's\ntrue on the most natural ways to fill out the details of the case.[^1]\nSo assume that Carla, Martha and Agnes are correctly completely certain\nthat they have a morally safe option. Also assume, if it isn't clear\nalready, that their only motivation for taking the safe option is to\nhedge against a possibility that they think is rather unlikely. Hedges\ncan be valuable, so the fact that this is their only motivation is not a\nreason to not take the safe option.\n\nIn contemporary debates, it's not often you see pro-vegetarianism and\nanti-abortion arguments run side by side. Especially in America, these\ndebates have been caught up in culture war politics, and on the whole\nvegetarians are on one side of this debate, and anti-abortion activists\non the other side. But the debates do have some things in common, and it\nis their commonality that will interest us primarily here. In\nparticular, we'll be looking at the idea that one should be vegetarian,\nand refrain from having abortions, on the grounds that these are the\ngood safe options to take. (This connection between the debates is not a\nnovel observation. D. @Moller2011 [426] notes it, and makes some pointed\nobservations about how it affects the philosophical landscape.)\n\nI'm going to argue that the idea that all three women should 'play it\nsafe' is entirely the wrong lesson to take from the cases. I think the\ncases are in important respects disanalogous. It is seriously morally\nwrong for Carla to include the syrup in the cake, but it is not wrong in\nthe same way for Martha to eat the steak, or for Agnes to have the\nabortion. A little more precisely, I'm going to be arguing that there is\nno good way to fill in the missing premise of this argument.\n\n> **The 'Might' Argument**\n\n1.  In the circumstances that Agnes/Martha are in, having an abortion\n    /eating a steak might be morally wrong.\n\n2.  In the circumstances that Agnes/Martha are in, continuing the\n    pregnancy /eating vegetables is definitely morally permissible.\n\n3.  **Missing Premise**\n\n4.  So, Agnes should not have the abortion, and Martha should not eat\n    the steak.\n\nWhen I argue that the 'Might' Argument cannot be filled in, I'm arguing\nagainst philosophers who, like Pascal, think they can convince us to act\nas if they are right as soon as we agree there is a non-zero chance that\nthey are right. I'm as a rule deeply sceptical of any such move, whether\nit be in ethics, theology, or anywhere else.\n\nBut note like someone responding to Pascal's Wager, I'm focussing on a\nrelatively narrow target here. Rejecting Pascal's Wager does not mean\nrejecting theism; it means rejecting Pascal's argument for being a\ntheist. Similarly, rejecting the 'Might' Argument does not mean\nrejecting all ethical arguments against meat-eating or abortion. It just\nmeans rejecting this one.\n\nI'm also not arguing about public policy here. The 'Might' Argument can\nbe generalised to any case where there is an epistmic asymmetry. The\nagent faces a choice where one option is morally risky, and the other is\nnot. Public policy debates are rarely, if ever, like that. A legislator\nwho bans meat-eating or abortion takes a serious moral risk. They\ninterfere seriously with the liberties of the people of their state, and\nperhaps do so for insufficient reason. (This point is well made by\n@Moller2011 [442].) So there isn't a 'play it safe' reason to support\nanti-meat or anti-abortion legislation, even if I'm wrong and there is\nsuch a reason to think that individuals should not eat meat or have\nabortions.\n\nThere are two ways to try to fill out the 'Might' Argument. We could try\nto offer a particular principle that implies the conclusion given the\nrest of the premises. Or we could try to stress the analogy between the\nthree cases that I started with. I'm going to have a brief discussion of\nthe first option, and then spend most of my time on the analogy. As\nwe'll see, there are many possible principles that we could try to use\nhere, but hopefully what I say about a some very simple principles, plus\nwhat I say about the analogy, will make it clear how I want to respond\nto most of them.\n\n### Principles\n\nOne way to fill in the **Missing Premise** is to have a general\nprinciple that links probabilities about morality with action. The\nsimplest such principle that would do the trick is this.\n\n> **ProbWrong**\\\n> If an agent has a choice between two options, and one might be wrong,\n> while the other is definitely permissible, then it is wrong to choose\n> the first option.\n\nI think **ProbWrong** does a reasonable job of capturing the intuition\nthat Agnes and Martha would be running an impermissible risk in having\nan abortion or eating meat. But **ProbWrong** has clearly implausible\nconsequences. Imagine that an agent has the following mental states:\n\n1.  She is sure that **ProbWrong** is true.\n\n2.  She is almost, but not completely, sure that eating meat is\n    permissible for her now.\n\n3.  She is sure that eating vegetables is permissible for her now.\n\n4.  She is sure that she has states 1--3.\n\nA little reflection shows that this is an incoherent set of states.\nGiven **ProbWrong**, it is simply wrong for someone with states 2 and 3\nto eat meat. And the agent knows that she has states 2 and 3. So she can\ndeduce from her other commitments and mental states that eating meat is,\nright now, wrong. So she shouldn't be almost sure that eating meat is\npermissible; she should be sure that it is wrong.\n\nThis argument generalises. If 1, 3 and 4 are true of any agent, the only\nways to maintain coherence are to be completely certain that meat eating\nis permissible, or completely certain that it is impermissible. But that\nis, I think, absurd; these are hard questions, and it is perfectly\nreasonable to be uncertain about them. At least, there is nothing\nincoherent about being uncertain about them. But **ProbWrong** implies\nthat this kind of uncertainty is incoherent, at least for believers in\nthe truth of **ProbWrong** itself. Indeed, it implies that in any\nasymmetric moral risk case, an agent who knows the truth of\n**ProbWrong** and is aware of her own mental states cannot have any\nattitude between certainty that both options are permissible, and\ncertainty that the risky action is not, for her, permissible. That is, I\nthink, completely absurd.\n\nNow most philosophers who advocate some principle or other as the\n**Missing Premise** don't quite advocate **ProbWrong**. We can position\nsome of the rival views by abstracting away from **ProbWrong** as\nfollows.\n\n> **General Principle**\\\n> If an agent has a choice between two options, and one might be X,\n> while the other is definitely not X, then it is Y to choose the first\n> option.\n\nWe get **ProbWrong** by substituting 'wrong' for both X and Y. But we\nsaw a decisive objection to that view. And we get a version of that\nobjection for any substitution where X and Y are the same. So a natural\nmove is to use different substitutions. If you replace X with 'wrong'\nand Y with 'irrational', you get something like a principle defended by\nTed @Lockhart2000.\n\n> **What Might be Wrong Is Irrational**\\\n> If an agent has a choice between two options, and one might be wrong,\n> while the other is definitely not wrong, then it is irrational to\n> choose the first option.\n\nNow at this stage we could look at whether this principle is plausible,\nand if not whether alternative principles offered by Alex @Guerrero2007,\nAndrew @Sepielli2009 or others are any better. You can probably guess\nhow this would go. We'd spend some time on counterexamples to the\nprinciple. And we'd spend some time on whether the conclusion we get in\nthis particular case is really plausible. (Is it true that Martha is not\nin any way immoral, but is irrational in virtue of moral risk? That\ndoesn't sound at all like the right conclusion.)\n\nBut I'm not going to go down that path. Shamelessly stealing an analogy\nfrom Jerry @Fodor2000b, I'm not going to get into a game of\nWhack-a-Mole, where I try to reject a principle that could fill in for\nthe Missing Premise, and if I succeed, another one pops up. I'm not\nplaying that game because you never actually win Whack-a-Mole; by going\nthrough possible principles one at a time it isn't clear how I could\never show that no principle could do the job.\n\nWhat I need to show is that we shouldn't look for a principle to fill in\nas Missing Premise. One reason we shouldn't is that the intuitions\nbehind principles like Lockhart's is really an intuition in favour of\n**ProbWrong**, and as such should be suspect. But a better reason is\nthat the analogy between Carla's case and Agnes/Martha's cases that\nmotivated the thought that there should be some principle here is\nmistaken. Once we see how weak that analogy is, I think we'll lose\nmotivation for trying to fix **ProbWrong**.\n\n### Welfare and Rationality {#welfareandrationality}\n\nSo my primary opponent the rest of the way is someone who wants to\ndefend the 'Might' Argument by pressing the analogy between Carla's case\nand the two more morally loaded cases.[^2] My reply will be that there\nare better analogies than this which point in the opposite direction. In\nparticular, I'm going to draw an analogy between Agnes and Martha's\ncases with some tricky cases concerning prudential reasoning. To set up\nthe case, I'll start with an assumption that guides the discussion.\n\nThe assumption is that deliberately undermining your own welfare, for no\ngain of any kind to anyone, is irrational. Indeed, it may be the\nparadigmatic form of irrationality. This is, I think, a widely if not\nuniversally held view. There is a radically Humean view that says that\nwelfrae just consists of preference satisfaction, and rationality is\njust a matter of means-end reasoning. If that's right then this\nassumption is not only right, it states the only kind of irrationality\nthere is. But you don't have to be that radical a Humean, or really any\nkind of Humean at all, to think the assumption is true.\n\nThe assumption doesn't just mean that doing things that you know will\nundermine your welfare for no associated gain is irrational. It means\nthat taking serious risks with your welfare for no compensating gain is\nirrational. Here is a clear example of that.\n\n> **Eating Cake**\\\n> Ricky is baking a cake for himself. He wants to put some sweetening\n> syrup into the cake to improve its taste. He reaches for an unmarked\n> bottle, which he is pretty sure contains the sweetener he wants. But\n> then he remembers that last week he had some arsenic in a similar\n> bottle. He is pretty sure that he threw the arsenic out, but not\n> exactly certain. As a matter of fact, the bottle does contain\n> sweetener, not arsenic, but Ricky isn't completely sure of this. What\n> should he do?\n\nI hope it is plausible enough that it would be irrational for Ricky to\nput the syrup in the cake. The risk he is running to his own welfare --\nhe literally will due if he's wrong about what's in the bottle -- isn't\nworth the gain in taste, given his level of confidence.\n\nWith that said, consider two more examples, Bob and Bruce. Bob has\nthought a bit about philosophical views on welfare. In particular, he\nhas spent a lot of time arguing with a colleague who has the G. E.\nMoore-inspired view that all that matters to welfare is the appreciation\nof beauty, and personal love.[^3] Bob is pretty sure this isn't right,\nbut he isn't certain, since he has a lot of respect for both his\ncolleague and for Moore.\n\nBob also doesn't care much for visual arts. He thought that art is\nsomething he should learn something about, both because of the value\nother people get from art, and because of what you can learn about the\nhuman condition from it. And while he's grateful for what he learned\nwhile trying to inculcate an appreciation of art, and he has become a\nmuch more reliable judge of what's beautiful and what isn't, the art\nitself just leaves him cold. I suspect most of us are like Bob about\nsome fields of art; there are genres that we feel have at best a kind of\nsterile beauty. That's how Bob feels about most visual art. This is\nperhaps unfortunate; we should feel sorry for Bob that he doesn't get as\nmuch pleasure from great art as we do. But it doesn't make Bob\nirrational, just unlucky.\n\nFinally, we will suppose, Bob is right to reject his colleague's Moorean\nview on welfare. Appreciation of art isn't a constituent of welfare. In\nthe example we'll suppose welfare is a matter of health, happiness and\nfriendship. So a fairly restricted version of an objective list theory\nof welfare is correct in Bob's world. And for people who like art,\nappreciating art can produce a lot of goods. Some of these are direct -\nart can make you happy. And some are indirect - art can teach you things\nand that learning can contribute to your welfare down the line. But if\nthe art doesn't make you happy, as it doesn't make Bob happy, and one\nhas learned all one can from a genre, as has Bob, there is no welfare\ngain from going to see art. It doesn't in itself make you better off, as\nBob's Moorean colleague thinks.\n\nNow Bob has to decide whether to spend some time at an art gallery on\nhis way home. He knows the art there will be beautiful, and he knows it\nwill leave him cold. There isn't any cost to going, but there isn't\nanything else he'll gain by going either. Still, Bob decides it isn't\nworth the trouble, and stays out. He doesn't have anything else to do,\nso he simply takes a slightly more direct walk home, which (as he knows)\nmakes at best a trifling gain to his welfare.\n\nI think Bob is perfectly rational to do this. He doesn't stand to gain\nanything at all from going to the gallery. In fact, it would be a little\nperverse, in a sense we'll return to, if he did go.\n\nBruce is also almost, but not completely certain, that health, happiness\nand friendship are the sole constituents of welfare.[^4] But he worries\nthat this is undervaluing art. He isn't so worried by the Moorean\nconsiderations of Bob's colleagues. But he fears there is something to\nthe Millian distinction between higher and lower pleasures, and thinks\nthat perhaps higher pleasures contribute more to welfare than lower\npleasures. Now most of Bruce's credence goes to alternative views. He is\nmostly confident that people think higher pleasures are more valuable\nthan lower pleasures because they are confusing causation and\nconstitution. It's true that experienceing higher pleasures will,\ntypically, be part of experiences with more downstream benefits than\nexperiences of lower pleasures. But that's the only difference between\nthe two that's prudentially relevant. (Bruce also suspects the Millian\nview goes along with a pernicious conservatism that values the pop\nculture of the past over the pop culture of the present solely because\nit is past. But that's not central to his theory of welfare.) And like\nBob, we'll assume Bruce is right about the theory of welfare in the\nworld of the example.\n\nNow Bruce can also go to the art gallery. And, unlike Bob, he will like\ndoing so. But going to it will mean he has to miss a night playing video\ngames that he often goes to. Bruce knows he will enjoy the video games\nmore. And since playing video games with friends helps strengthen\nfriendships, there may be a further reason to skip the gallery and play\ngames. Like Bob, Bruce knows that there can be very good consequences of\nseeing great art. But also like Bob, Bruce knows that none of that\nrelevant here. Given Bruce's background knowledge, he will have fun at\nthe exhibition, but won't learn anything significant.\n\nStill, Bruce worries that he should take a slightly smaller amount of\nhigher pleasure rather than a slightly larger amount of lower pleasure.\nAnd he's worried about this even though he doesn't give a lot of\ncredence to the whole theory of higher and lower pleasures. But he\ndoesn't go to the gallery. He simply decides to act on the basis of his\npreferred theory of welfare, and since that welfare is correct, he\nmaximises his welfare by doing this.\n\nNow I think both Bob and Bruce are rational in what they do. But there\nis an argument that they are not. I'll focus on Bob, but the points here\ngeneralise.\n\n1.  Going to the gallery might increase his welfare substantially, since\n    it will lead to more appreciation of beauty, and appreciation of\n    beauty might be a key constituent of welfare.\n\n2.  Not going to the gallery definitely won't increase his welfare by\n    more than a trivial amount.\n\n3.  It is irrational to do something that might seriously undermine your\n    own welfare for no compensating gain.\n\n4.  So it is irrational for Bob to skip the gallery.\n\nI think that argument is wrong. Bob's case is rather unlike Ricky's.\nThere is a sense in which Bob might be undermining his own welfare in\nskipping the gallery. But it is not the relevant sense. We can\ndistinguish the two senses making the scope of various operators\nexplicit. The first of these claims is plausibly true; the second is\nfalse.\n\n-   Bob's welfare is such that it is irrational for him to do something\n    that might undermine it for no compensating gain.\n\n-   It is irrational for Bob to do something that might undermine his\n    welfare, whatever that turns out to be, for no compensating gain.\n\nIf welfare turns out to be health, happiness and learning, then the\nfirst claim says that it is irrational to risk undermining your health,\nhappiness and learning for no compensating gain. And that is, I think,\nright. But the second claim says that for any thing, if that thing might\nbe welfare, and an action might undermine it, it is irrational to\nperform the action without a compensating gain. That's a much stronger,\nand a much less plausible, claim.\n\nImportantly, Bob's 'Might' Argument doesn't go through with the first\nclaim. Given that appreciation of beauty is not directly a component of\nwelfare, and that the various channels through which appreciating beauty\nmight lead to an increase in welfare are blocked for Bob, there is no\nchance that going to the gallery will increase his actual welfare. Going\nto the gallery will increase something, namely his appreciation of\nbeauty, that is for all Bob knows part of welfare. But that's not the\nsame thing, and it isn't relevant to rationality.\n\nOne caveat to all this. On some theories of welfare, it will not be\nobvious that even the first claim is right. Consider a view (standard\namong economists) that welfare is preference satisfaction. Now you might\nthink that even the first claim is ambiguous, between a claim that one's\npreferences are such that it is irrational to undermine them (plausibly\ntrue), and a claim that it is irrational to undermine one's preference\nsatisfaction. The latter claim is not true. If someone offers me a pill\nthat will make me have preferences for things that are sure to come out\ntrue (I want the USA to be more populous than Monaco; etc.), it is\nrational to refuse it. And that's true even though taking the pill will\nensure that I do well by preference satisfaction. The point is that\ntaking the pill does not, as things stand, satisfy my preferences. If I\nprefer X to Y, I should aim to bring about X. But I shouldn't aim to\nbring about a state of having satisfied preferences; that could lead to\nrather perverse behaviour, like taking this pill.\n\n### Duelling Analogies {#duellinganalogies}\n\nHere's how I see the five cases we've discussed so far fitting together.\n\n|        |  Factual Uncertainty | Normative Uncertainty |\n|-------:|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|\n| Prudential  | Ricky   | Bob |\n| Risk  |     | Bruce |\n|    |    |    |\n| Moral | Carla | Agnes |\n| Risk |  | Martha |\n\nOn the left-hand column, we have agents who are uncertain about a simple\nfactual question; is this syrup sweetener or arsenic? On the right-hand\ncolumn, we have agents who are uncertain about a question about the\nnature of value; does the decision I'm facing right now have serious\nevaluative consequences?\n\nIt's even easier to see what is separating the rows. Ricky, Bob and\nBruce face questions that, in the first instance, just concern their own\nwelfare. Carla, Agnes and Martha face questions that concern the\nmorality of their actions. I don't mean to say that there's a hard line\nbetween these two. Perhaps being moral is an important part of the good\nlife. And perhaps one has a moral duty to live well. I'm a little\ndoubtful on both scores actually. But even if the questions bleed into\neach other in one or other way, we can separate questions that are in\nthe first instance about the agent's own welfare from questions that\nbear directly on the morality of the agent. (Recognising, as always,\nthat there will be borderline cases.) And that's how we've split the\nrows.\n\nOne way to motivate the 'Might' Argument is to stress the analogy\nbetween Carla and Agnes/Martha. After all, both of them risk killing\nsomeone (or something) statused if they act in a certain way. But once\nwe look at the table more broadly, it is easy to see why we should\nresist the analogy between Carla and Agnes/Martha. The analogy between\nBob/Bruce and Agnes/Martha is much stronger. We can see that by thinking\nabout their motivations.\n\nWhy would Bruce go to the gallery? Not for pleasure; he'll get more\npleasure out of playing video games with his friends. Not for the\neducational value; he won't learn more by looking at these kind of\npaintings again. His only reason for going is that he thinks it might\nincrease his welfare. That is, he can only be motivated to go if he is\nmotivated to care about welfare as such, and not about the things that\nmake up welfare. There is something perverse about this motivation. It\nis healthy and natural to want the things that make up a good life. It\nis less healthy, and less natural, to directly desire a good life\nwhatever that may be.\n\nNow think about Martha. Why should she turn down the steak? Not because\nshe values the interests of the cow over her dining. She does not. And\nnot because she should have that value. By hypothesis, she need not do\nso. (Remember we're only interested in replying to people who argue from\nThe 'Might' Argument to vegetarianism; if you think there's a direct\nargument that Martha should value the cow so highly that she doesn't eat\nmeat, that's a different debate.) Rather, she has to care about morality\nas such. And that seems wrong.\n\nThe argument I'm making here owes a lot to a similar argument offered\nfor a somewhat different conclusion by Michael @Smith1994. He compared\nthe person who desires to do what is actually right, as he put it,\ndesires the right de re, with the person who desires to do what is right\nwhatever that turns out to be, as he put it, desires the right de dicto.\n\n> Good people care non-derivatively about honesty, the weal and woe of\n> their children and friends, the well-being of their fellows, people\n> getting what they deserve, justice, equality, and the like, not just\n> one thing: doing what they believe to be right, where this is read *de\n> dicto* and not *de re*. Indeed, commonsense tells us that being so\n> motivated is a fetish or moral vice, not the one and only moral\n> virtue.  [@Smith1994 75]\n\nI think that's all true. A good person will dive into a river to rescue\na drowning child. (Assuming that is that it is safe enough to do so;\nit's wrong to create more rescue work for onlookers.) And she won't do\nso because it's the right thing to do. She'll do it because there's a\nchild who needs to be rescued, and that child is valuable.\n\nThe analogy with the welfare case strengthens this conclusion. The\nrational person values their health, happiness and friendships (and\nwhatever goes into the actual list of things that constitute welfare.).\nThey don't simply value their welfare, and desire to increase it. That's\nwhy it would be perverse for Bruce to go to the gallery. He would only\ngo if he had a strange motivation. And it is why it would be perverse\nfor Martha to turn down the steak. To do so she would have to care about\nmorality, whatever it is, not about the list of things that Smith\nrightly says a good person will care about.\n\n### An Alternative Analogy {#analternativeanalogy}\n\nMoller offers the following analogy to back up something like the\n'Might' Argument.[^5]\n\n> Suppose Frank is the dean of a large medical school. Because his work\n> often involves ethical complications touching on issues like medical\n> experimentation and intellectual property, Frank has an ethical\n> advisory committee consisting of 10 members that helps him make\n> difficult decisions. One day Frank must decide whether to pursue\n> important research for the company in one of two ways: plan A and plan\n> B would both accomplish the necessary research, and seem to differ\n> only to the trivial extent that plan A would involve slightly less\n> paperwork for Frank. But then Frank consults the ethics committee,\n> which tells him that although everyone on the committee is absolutely\n> convinced that plan B is morally permissible, a significant minority -\n> four of the members - feel that plan A is a moral catastrophe. So the\n> majority of the committee thinks that the evidence favors believing\n> that both plans are permissible, but a significant minority is\n> confident that one of the plans would be a moral abomination, and\n> there are practically no costs attached to avoiding that possibility.\n> Let's assume that Frank himself cannot investigate the moral issues\n> involved - doing so would involve neglecting his other\n> responsibilities. Let's also assume that Frank generally trusts the\n> members of the committee and has no special reason to disregard\n> certain members' opinions. Suppose that Frank decides to go ahead with\n> plan A, which creates slightly less paperwork for him, even though, as\n> he acknowledges, there seems to be a pretty significant chance that\n> enacting that plan will result in doing something very deeply wrong\n> and he has a virtually cost-free alternative. (436)\n\nThe intuitions are supposed to be that this is a very bad thing for\nFrank to do, and that this illustrates that there's something very wrong\nwith ignoring moral risk. But once we fill in the details of the case,\nit is clear that this can't be the right diagnosis.\n\nThe first thing to note is that there is something special about\ndecision making as the head of an organization. Frank doesn't just have\na duty to do what he thinks is best. He has a duty to reflect his\nschool's policies and viewpoints. A dean is not a dictator, not even an\nenlightened, benevolent one. Not considering an advisory committee's\nreport is bad practice qua dean of the medical school, whether or not\nFrank's own decisions should be guided by moral risk.\n\nWe aren't told whether A or B are moral catastrophes. If B is a moral\ncatastrophe, and A isn't, there's something good about what Frank does.\nOf course, he does it for the wrong reasons, and that might undercut our\nadmiration of him. But it does seem relevant to our assessment to know\nwhether A or B are actually permissible.\n\nAssuming that B is actually permissible, the most natural reading of the\ncase is that Frank shouldn't do A. Or, at least, that he shouldn't do A\nfor this reason. But that doesn't mean he should be sensitive to moral\nrisk. Unless the four members who think that A is a moral catastrophe\nare crazy, there must be some non-moral facts that make A morally risky.\nIf Frank doesn't know what those facts are, then he isn't just making a\ndecision under moral risk, he's making a decision involving physical\nrisk. And that's clearly a bad thing to do.\n\nIf Frank does know why the committee members think that the plan is a\nmoral catastrophe, his action is worse. Authorising a particular kind of\nmedical experimentation, when you know what effects it will have on\npeople, and where intelligent people think this is morally\nimpermissible, on the basis of convenience seems to show a striking lack\nof character and judgment. Even if Frank doesn't have the time to work\nthrough all the ins and outs of the case, it doesn't follow that it is\npermissible to make decisions based on convenience, rather than based on\nsome (probably incomplete) assessment of the costs and benefits of the\nprogram.\n\nBut having said all that, there's one variant of this case, perhaps\nsomewhat implausible, where it doesn't seem that Frank should listen to\nthe committee at all. Assume that both Frank and the committee have a\nfairly thick understanding of what's involved in doing A and B. They\nknow which actions maximise expected utility, they know that which acts\nare consistent with the categorical imperative, they know which people\naffected by the acts would be entitled to complain about our\nperformance, or non-performance, of each act, they know which acts are\nsuch that everyone could rationally will it to be true that everyone\nbelieves those acts to be morally permitted, and so on. What they\ndisagree about is what rightness and wrongness consist in. What's common\nknowledge between Frank, the majority and the minority is that both A\nand B pass all these tests, with one exception: A is not consistent with\nthe categorical imperative. And the minority members of the committee\nare committed Kantians, who think that they have a response to the best\nrecent anti-Kantian arguments.\n\nIt seems to me, intuitively, that this shouldn't matter one whit. I\nthink the extreme view I'm defending in this paper is not, in general,\nintuitive. But it is worth noting how counterintuitive the opposing view\nis in this extreme case. A moral agent simply won't care what the latest\njournal articles have been saying about the relative importance of\nKant's formulation of the categorical imperative versus either\ncontemporary variants or approaches from very different traditions. It's\npossible (though personally I doubt it), that learning of an action that\nit violates the categorical imperative would be relevant to one's\nmotivations. It's not possible that learning that some people you admire\nthink the categorical imperative is central to morality could change\none's motivation to perform, or not perform, actions one knew all along\nviolated the categorical imperative. At least that's not possible\nwithout falling into the bad kind of moral fetishism that Smith rightly\ndecries.\n\nSo here's my general response to analogies of this kind, one that\nshouldn't be surprising given the previous sections. Assuming the\nminority committee members are rational, either they know some facts\nabout the impacts of A and B that Frank is unaware of, or they hold some\nphilosophical theory that Frank doesn't. If it's the former, Frank\nshould take their concerns into account; but that's not because he\nshould be sensitive to moral risk, it's because he should be sensitive\nto non-moral risk. If it's the latter, Frank shouldn't take their\nconcerns into account; that would be moral fetishism.\n\n### Objections and Replies {#objectionsandreplies}\n\nI've discussed this paper with many people, and they almost all have\nobjections. I'm going to respond to some of the most pressing, and end\nwith three objections that I don't have a particularly satisfying\nresponse to. The most important objection, from my perspective, is the\nsecond; it's what most closely links the discussion of this paper to the\nbroader issues about normative externalism that I find most fascinating.\n\n*Objection*: All you've shown so far is that moral recklessness isn't\nobjectively wrong. But that's trivial. There's a sense in which ordinary\nrecklessness isn't objectively wrong either. What matters is that both\nare subjectively wrong, where this tracks what the agent believes.\n\n*Reply*: Distinguish between two things: doing things that produce bad\noutcomes, and doing the wrong thing. Unless you are sure that actualist\nconsequentialism is a conceptual truth, this is a conceptually coherent\ndistinction. Among actions that produce bad outcomes, there are easily\ndetectable distinctions we draw that seem to track whether the actions\nare wrong.\n\nIn the paper so far I've usually been focussed on people who are almost\ncertain of the truth. But let's change tack for a minute and look at\npeople who have catastrophically false beliefs. In particular, consider\nHannah and Hannibal. (I'm taking the Hannibal example from work by\nElizabeth @EHarman2011, who uses it for a related purpose.)\n\nHannah takes her spouse out for what is meant to be a pleasant\nanniversary dinner. It's a nice restaurant, and there's no reason to\nthink anything will go wrong. But the restaurant gets bad supplies that\nday, and Hannah's spouse gets very sick as a consequence of going there.\n\nHannibal is a 1950s father with sexist attitudes that were sadly\ntypical. He has a son and a daughter, and makes sure to put together a\ngood college savings fund for his son, but does not do the same for his\ndaughter. Indeed, if he had tried to do the same for his daughter, he\nwould not have been able to support his son as well as he actually did.\nAs a consequence, his daughter cannot afford to go to college.\n\nHannah was mistaken about a matter of fact; whether the food at the\nrestaurant was safe. Hannibal was mistaken about a moral matter; whether\none should treat one's sons and daughters equally. Now consider what\nhappens when both see the error of their ways. Hannah should feel bad\nfor her spouse, but there is no need for any kind of self-reproach. It's\nhard to imagine she would feel ashamed for what she did. And there's no\nobligation for her to feel guilty, though it's easier to imagine she\nwould feel some guilt. Hannibal, on the other hand, should feel both\nashamed and guilty. And I think it's natural that a father who realised\ntoo late that he had been guilty of this kind of sexism would in fact\nfeel the shame and guilt he should feel. The fact that his earlier\nsexist attitudes were widely shared, and firmly and sincerely held,\nsimply seems irrelevant here.\n\nThe simplest explanation of this emotional difference is that what\nHannibal does is, in an important sense, wrong, and what Hannah does is\nnot wrong. But the wrongness at issue is missing from the\nobjective/subjective distinction the objector here makes. Both Hannah\nand Hannibal do things that make things objectively worse. Both Hannah\nand Hannibal do things that are good given their beliefs at the time\nthey act. Yet there is a distinction between them. It's this distinction\nthat the normative externalist wants to stress. There's a normative\nstatus that is not wholly objective, insofar as it doesn't reproach\nHannah, but not wholly subjective, insofar as it does reproach Hannibal.\n\n*Objection*: But still, we need a standard that can guide the agent,\nthat an agent can live by. Do the right thing, whatever it turns out to\nbe, is not such a standard. And what motivates internalism is the\nthought that this kind of agent-centred norm is most important.\n\n*Reply*: If this is the motivation for internalism, it is vulnerable to\na nasty regress. The problem is that internalists disagree amongst\nthemselves, and there is no internalist-friendly way to resolve the\ndisagreement.[^6] (Much of what I say here draws on arguments that\nElizabeth @Harman2013 makes about the nature of internalist norms.)\n\nThe examples that illustrate this point are a little convoluted, so I'll\njust state one example schematically to make the point. And I'll put\nnumerical values on options because it is hard to state the internalist\nviews without doing this.\n\nAn agent faces a choice between four options: A, B, C and D. Option A is\nthe right option, both in the sense that the externalist will praise\npeople who take it and criticise others, and in the sense that a fully\ninformed intrnalist would do A. But our agent is, sadly, not fully\ninformed. She thinks A is a completely horrible thing do to. Her\ncredences are split over three moral theories, X, Y and Z, with credence\n0.5 in X, 0.1 in Y, and 0.4 in Z. The moral values of each action\naccording to each moral theory are given by this table. (Higher values\nare better; non-negative values are for actions that are permissible\naccording to the theory.)\n\n\\@RCCC@ &X&Y&Z\\\nB&0&0&--20\\\nC&0&--30&--10\\\nD&--1&--5&0\\\n\nSo the probability, according to the agent, that each action is\npermissible is 0.6 for B, 0.5 for C and 0.4 for D. The expected moral\nvalue of each action is --8 for B, --7 for C, and --2 for D.\n\nOur agent at this stage is a bit confused. And reading some philosophy\ndoesn't help. She reads Ted @Lockhart2000 saying that what she should do\nis the thing that is most probably permissible. And she reads Andrew\n@Sepielli2009 saying that what she should do is the thing that maximises\nexpected moral value. But these pieces of advice pull in opposite\ndirections. She could try and come up with a theory of how to resolve\nthe tension, but that is just as hard as resolving the dispute between\nLockhart and Sepielli in the first place. She eventually settles on the\nrule *Don't do what any plausible meta-theory says is the worst thing to\ndo*. Since Lockhart says D is the worst thing to do (having the lowest\nprobability of permissibility), and Sepielli says that B is the worst\nthing to do (having the lowest expected moral value), she does C.\n\nHere's the lesson of this little parable. There is a worry that\nexternalism is not sufficiently action guiding, and can't be a norm that\nagents can live by. But any philosophical theory whatsoever is going to\nhave to say something about how to judge agents who ascribe some\ncredence to a rival theory. That's true whether the theory is the\nfirst-order theory that Jeremy Bentham offers, or the second-order\ntheory that Andrew Sepielli offers. Once you're in the business of\ntheorising at all, you're going to impose an external standard on an\nagent, one that an agent may, in good faith and something like good\nconscience, sincerely reject. The externalist says that it's better to\nhave that standard be one concerned with what is genuinely valuable in\nthe world, rather than a technical standard about resolving moral\nuncertainty. But every theorist has to be a little bit externalist; the\nobjector who searches for a thoroughly subjective standard is going to\nend up like Ponce de Leon.\n\n*Objection*: You've focussed on the case where Martha is almost sure\nthat meat-eating is permissible. What do we say about the person who is\nalmost sure that meat-eating is impermissible, eats meat anyway, and\ngets lucky, because they are in a world where it is permissible? The\nnormative externalist says that they are beyond reproach, but something\nseems wrong here.\n\n*Reply*: The externalist is only committed to the view that the most\nimportant evaluative concepts are independent of the agent's beliefs.\nThere is something rather simple to say about this person; they are a\nhypocrite.\n\n*Objection*: Wait a minute! We wanted something reproachful to say about\nthis person. But all you've said is that they are a hypocrite, by which\nyou presumably mean they don't act in accord with their beliefs about\nwhat's valuable. And Huckleberry Finn is a hypocrite in that sense, but\nalso beyond reproach.\n\n*Reply*: Good point, but I think we can still say something. Huckleberry\nFinn acts against what he believes to be most valuable in order to\npreserve a great good: Jim's freedom. Our imagined meat-eater acts\nagainst what he believes to be most valuable in order to get a tastier\nlunch. Someone who will do what they believe to be wrong in order to\nproduce a gain which is both trivial, and entirely accrues to them,\nreveals a bad character. The gain that Huckleberry Finn's actions\nproduce, note, are neither trivial nor selfish, and that's why his\nactions do not indicate a character defect. But giving up on morality\nfor a trivial, selfish gain is a sign that things will go very badly\nwrong, very soon.[^7]\n\n*Objection*: How can you even acknowledge such a thing as hypocrisy?\nIsn't the positing of such a norm vulnerable to the same regress\narguments as you've run against the internalist?\n\n*Reply*: No, because we can be an externalist about what is and is not\nhypocritical. We can, at least in theory, imagine these two cases. The\nfirst case is a person whose beliefs, credences and values indicate that\nthe best thing to do is B, but who thinks the best thing to do given\nthose beliefs, credences and values is C. They do C. They are\nhypocritical, although they (falsely) do not believe they are. The\nsecond case is a person who is exactly like this, except they do B. They\nare not acting hypocritically. Or, at least, they are not a first-order\nhypocrite. Perhaps we can recognise a distinct state of second-order\nhypocrisy, and say that they fall under it. And you can imagine even\nhigher-orders. The externalist can say all of these exist. They aren't\nthe worst offences ever, but it is coherent to posit all of them.\n\n*Objection*: Once you recognise hypocrisy, there is a way to reinstate\nthe 'Might' Argument. Martha and Agnes are hypocrites. They shouldn't be\nhypocrites. So they shouldn't eat meat, or have an abortion.\n\n*Reply*: I simply deny that they are hypocrites. Compare these three\nstatuses.\n\n-   Doing that which you disvalue.\n\n-   Doing that which you believe to be less valuable.\n\n-   Doing that which you have some credence is less valuable.\n\nThe first is clearly hypocrisy, and the second seems similar. But\nthere's no reason to say the third is hypocritical. The following\nexample, closely modelled on one offered by Lara @Buchak2013 makes this\npoint.\n\nAnnie values her close relationship with her brother Jack. One day, she\nreceives some evidence that marginally raises her credence that Jack did\nsomething horrible. She is pretty sure Jack is innocent, but her\ncredence in his guilt does rise a notch. Still, Annie values her\nrelationship with Jack just as much as she did before. If Jack did the\nhorrible thing, she would not value the relationship. But getting some\n(almost surely misleading) evidence that Jack did something horrible\ndoes not change her values at all.\n\nThe lesson here is that credences about what is valuable can quite\ncoherently float free from valuings. There is a tricky question about\nwhat happens to beliefs about what is valuable in these cases. Buchak\nthinks they should go with valuings, and this is a problem for theories\nthat reduce credence to belief. I don't agree with this extension of her\nargument, but I certainly agree that small changes in credence about\nwhat is valuable need not, and often should not, change what one values.\n\n*Objection*: The externalist can't explain why moral ignorance\nexculpates.\n\n*Reply*: The short reply is that, following for example Elizabeth\n@EHarman2011, I don't think moral ignorance does exculpate. But the\nlonger reply is that the internalist can't explain why moral ignorance\nis at best an excuse, not a defence, and why it only works in special\ncircumstances.\n\nWe already saw one distinctive aspect of moral ignorance above, in the\nHannibal example. Hannibal should feel ashamed, and guilty, about what\nhe did. That's because even if he had an excuse, he did the wrong thing.\nAnd this doesn't just mean he made the world worse. This notion of\nwrongness is an externalist one, even if we allow an internalist\nfriendly excuse for the wrong action.\n\nBut when we turn to classic defenders of the idea that moral ignorance\ncan be exculpatory, such as Susan @Wolf1980 and Cheshire @Calhoun1989,\nwe see that it is meant to be an excuse with a very limited scope. And\nwhether the circumstances are such as to furnish this excuse will not\nalways be clear to the wrong-doer. (Indeed, it might be that they are\nnot, and could not, be clear.) So even if moral ignorance was\nexculpatory, this wouldn't be much help to the internalist. Since on\neveryone's view some moral ignorance is blameworthy, and the factors\nthat may make moral ignorance an excuse are external to the agent, only\nthe externalist can offer a plausible theory on which moral ignorance is\nexculpatory.\n\n*Objection*: Even if it is fetishistic to be motivated by the good as\nsuch, this doesn't extend to thick moral properties. Indeed, the quote\nfrom Smith you use explicitly contrasts the thinnest of moral properties\nwith ever so slightly thicker ones. So your objections to arguments from\nmoral uncertainty don't extend to arguments from what we might call\nvirtue uncertainty.\n\n*Reply*: I agree with this. Here are some things that seem like be\nnon-fetishistic motivations to avoid doing action A.\n\n-   It would be cowardly to do A.\n\n-   Doing A would be free-riding.\n\n-   I would not appreciate if others did A-like actions that could\n    disadvantage me.\n\nThe objector draws attention to the distinction between thick and thin\nmoral properties, and I think that's the right way to highlight what's\nat issue here. But note how thin these are getting. I'm conceding that\nthe fact that something violates the Golden Rule could be a motivation,\nas could the fact that it violates the categorical imperative.[^8] What\nI deny is that the wrongness of the action could be an extra motivation\nover and above these. This was the point of the discussion of Moller's\nexecutive in the previous section.\n\nFor each of these motivations, there are cases where the risk of\nviolating the relevant standard can be motivating. So one might not do\nsomething because there is a risk that it would be cowardly, or\nfree-riding, or violate the Golden Rule or categorical imperative. I\ndon't mean to object to any argument along these lines.\n\n*Objection*: Now you've conceded that a version of the 'Might' Argument\ncan work. After all, there are vices that might be manifest by eating\nmeat or having an abortion.\n\n*Reply*: True, but the fact that some action might manifest a vice can\nhardly be a decisive consideration against doing it. If the vice in\nquestion is relatively small, or the chance of manifesting it is\nrelatively small, it is easy to see how this kind of consideration could\nbe overridden.\n\nFor instance, imagine an argument for vegetarianism as follows. Eating\nmeat you haven't killed yourself might be cowardly. It certainly isn't\nobvious that letting someone else do the dirty work isn't a\nmanifestation of cowardice. So that's a reason to not eat meat. I can\ngrant it is a reason while thinking that (a) this kind of cowardice\nisn't a particularly heinous vice, and (b) it isn't that likely that\nmeat eating is really cowardly in this way, so the reason is a\nrelatively weak one, that can easily be overridden.\n\nBut the concession I want to make is that there could be an argument\nalong these lines that works. In earlier presentations of this paper,\nI'd tried to extend my argument to respond to the arguments Alex\n@Guerrero2007 makes for vegetarianism. But I'm no longer sure that was a\ngood idea. But I think Guerrero's arguments can be understood in such a\nway that they rely only on the idea that we shouldn't risk instantiating\ncertain particular vices. And I don't have a systematic objection to\nevery argument of this form. After all, I do think we have a reason to\navoid running a risk of being free-riders, or cowards, even if the\naction under consideration would not be cowardly, or an act of\nfree-riding.\n\n*Objection*: Even without getting into debates about *moral*\nuncertainty, there are other uncertainty arguments against meat eating\nor abortion. There is some probability that cows or foetuses have souls,\nand it is a very serious harm to kill something that has a soul.\n\n*Reply*: Nothing I say here helps respond to this argument. If one\nthinks that what's wrong with killing is that it kills a soul, thinks\nthat there's a non-trivial chance that cows or foetuses have souls, and\neats meat or has an abortion anyway, then one really is being immoral.\nWhether this should be called recklessness is tricky, since one could\nunderstand 'recklessness' as being concerned only with risks that are in\na certain sense objective. But it certainly seems that such a person\nwould be morally on a par with the people I've said are immoral in\nvirtue of the risks they pose to others. It's an empirical question, and\none I don't have any good evidence about, whether arguments from\nuncertainty about abortion and meat eating primarily concern uncertainty\nabout facts, as this objection suggests, uncertainty about virtues\n(broadly construed) as the previous objection suggests, or uncertainty\nabout right and wrong.\n\n*Objection*: It may be wrong to be only concerned with right and wrong,\nbut it isn't wrong to have this be one of your considerations.\n\n*Reply*: I don't think you get the 'Might' Argument to work unless\nconcern with right and wrong, whatever they turn out to be, are the only\nconsiderations. Assume that they are only one consideration among many.\nThen even if they point in one direction, they may be overridden by the\nother considerations. And if the 'Might' Argument doesn't work, then\nnormative internalism, in its strongest forms, is false. So I really\nonly need to appeal to the plausible view that right and wrong as such\nshouldn't be our only motivations to get the conclusions I want.\n\nBut actually I think the stronger, prima facie implausible, view is\ntrue: rightness and wrongness as such shouldn't even be part of our\nmotivation. My reasons for thinking this are related to my responses to\nthe next three objections. Unfortunately, these are the least developed,\nand least satisfying, of the responses I'll offer. But I'll conclude\nwith them to leave you with a sense of where I think the debate is at,\nand what I think future research could assist with.\n\n*Objection*: Here's one occasion where we do seem motivated by the good\nas such, or by welfare as such -- when we're doing moral or prudential\nreflection. Sometimes we stop and think, What would be the best thing to\ndo in a certain kind of case? In philosophy departments, people might do\nthat solely because they're interested in the answer. But most people\nwill think that these projects have some practical consequences. And the\nstrong form of Smith's fetishism objection that you're relying on can't\nexplain why this is a good practice.\n\n*Reply*: I agree this is a good practice. But I think it is consistent\nwith what I've said so far. Start with an observation also by Michael\nSmith, that moral inquiry has \"a certain characteristic coherentist\nform\"  [@Smith1994 40--41]. I think (not originally) that this is\nbecause we're not trying to figure out something about this magical\nthing, the good, but rather because we're trying to systematise and\nwhere necessary reconcile our values. When we're doing moral philosophy,\nwe're often doing work that more at the systematising end, trying to\nfigure out whether seemingly disparate values have a common core. When\nwe're trying to figure out what is right in the context of deciding what\nto do, we're often trying to reconcile, where possible, conflicting\nvalues. But as long as we accept that there are genuinely plural values,\nboth in moral and prudential reasoning, we shouldn't think that a desire\nto determine what is right is driven by a motivation to do the right\nthing, or to live a good life, as such.\n\n*Objection*: Sometimes people act from moral conscience. At least by\ntheir own account, they do something that involves no small amount of\npersonal sacrifice because it is the right thing to do. And, at least\nsome of the time, these people are highly praiseworthy. The strong\nversion of the fetishism objection you're using can't account for this.\n\n*Objection*: So I have to bite some bullets here. I have to offer a\nslightly unnatural reformulation of these cases. In particular, in cases\nwhere someone acts from conscience, I have to say that there is\nsomething they value greatly, and they are acting on that value. What\nthe value is will depend on the case. It might be welfare, or freedom,\nor keeping promises, or justice. It might even, and this is the version\nof the case that's trickiest for me, be a value they can't clearly\narticulate. A person can know something is the right thing to do and not\nbe in any position to say why it is the right thing to do. And they may\ndo it, even at great sacrifice. I think I'm required to say here that\ntheir motivation is the feature of the act that makes it right, not the\nrightness of the act. That's not optimal, especially since it isn't how\nthe agent themself would describe the motivation. But I don't think we\nshould assume that agents have perfect access to their own motivations.\n\nI take myself to be here largely in agreement with a line suggested by\nSigrún @Svavarsdottir1999 when she says, in defence of an externalist\ntheory of moral motivation.\n\n> The externalist account I propose does not ascribe to the good person\n> a particular concern with doing the right thing. Rather it ascribes to\n> him a more general concern with doing what is morally valuable or\n> required, when that might include what is just, fair, honest, etc.\n>  [@Svavarsdottir1999 197--8]\n\nThere are two points here that are particularly relevant to the current\nproject. The good person has a plurality of motivations, not just one.\nAnd the fetishism argument really has a very narrow application: it\nreally only works against theories which say goodness is a matter of\nhaving the thinnest of possible moral motivations. It's odd to be solely\nconcerned with doing the right thing as such. (It's even odd, I say, to\nhave this as one of your concerns, though that's not central to my\nargument.) It's not odd to have fairness as one of one's concerns, even\nan important one. Svavarsdóttir suggests that once the range of the\nfetishism argument is restricted in this way, it can't do the work that\nSmith needs it to do in his attack on motivational externalism. I don't\nneed to take a stand on this, since I'm not taking sides in the debate\nbetween motivational externalists and internalists. All I need is that\nSmith's objection to fetishism can work, as long as it is suitably\nrestricted.\n\n*Objection*: Is there any coherent meta-ethical view that can licence\nall the moves you've made? On the one hand, normative claims must be\ndistinctive enough that uncertainty about them has a very different\neffect on deliberation and motivation than everyday factual claims. On\nthe other hand, your externalism is the view that the moral facts matter\nmore than anyone's (reasonable) beliefs about the moral facts. The first\nconsideration suggests a strong kind of moral anti-realism, where moral\nclaims are different in kind to factual claims. But the second suggests\na strong kind of moral realism, where there are these wonderful moral\nfacts around to do the work that reasonable moral beliefs cannot do. Is\nthis even consistent? And if it is, is there a meta-ethical view we\nshould want to hold consistent with all of it?\n\n*Reply*: The inconsistency charge isn't, I think, too hard to meet. As\nlong as the 'facts' that I talk about when I say the moral facts matter\nare construed in an extremely deflationary way, then I'm not being\ninconsistent. Any kind of sophisticated expressivist or quasi-realist\nview that allows you to talk about moral facts, while perhaps not\nmeaning quite the same thing by 'fact' as a realist does, will be\nconsistent with everything I've said.\n\nThe second challenge is harder, and I don't know that I have a good\nresponse. I would like to make the theory I've presented here consistent\nwith a fairly thoroughgoing moral realism, and I'm not sure that's\npossible. (I'd like to do that simply because I don't want the fate of\nthe theory tied up with contentious issues in meta-ethics.) I think the\nway to make the view consistent with this kind of realism is to defend\nthe view that neither the metaphysical status of a truth (as necessary\nor contingent, analytic or synthetic, and so on) has very little to do\nwith its appropriate role in deliberation or evaluation. But defending\nthat, and showing how it suffices to make moral cognitivism consistent\nwith the view I'm describing, is more than I know how to do now.\n\n[^1]: Here is one argument against the claims of the last two sentences.\n    Assume that, as is realistic, Agnes wants an abortion because her\n    life will be worse in significant ways if she becomes a parent\n    (again) in the near future. And assume that Agnes has a moral duty\n    to herself; making her own life worse in significant ways for no\n    sufficient reason is immoral. Then it could be immoral for her to\n    continue the pregnancy. I don't find this reason particularly\n    compelling; it seems to me odd to say that people who make heroic\n    sacrifices are immoral in virtue of paying insufficient regard to\n    their own welfare. But the issues here are difficult, and I\n    certainly don't have a strong argument that we should give no\n    credence to the view that there are substantial duties to self that\n    make misguided sacrifices on behalf of others immoral. Still, I'm\n    going to set this whole line of reasoning aside for most of the\n    paper, while just noting that this could be a way even for an\n    internalist to reject the practical arguments I'll discuss below.\n    I'm grateful to conversations with Elizabeth Anderson here (but not\n    only here!).\n\n[^2]: D. @Moller2011 offers an interesting different analogy to motivate\n    something like the 'Might' Argument. I think that analogy is a\n    little messier than the one I'm focussing on, and I'll discuss it\n    separately below.\n\n[^3]: It would be a bit of a stretch to say this is Moore's own view,\n    but you can see how a philosopher might get from Moore to here.\n    Appreciation of beauty is one of the constituents of welfare in the\n    objective list theory of welfare put forward by John @Finnis2011\n    [87--8].\n\n[^4]: Thanks to Julia Markovits for suggesting the central idea behind\n    the Bruce example, and to Jill North for some comments that showed\n    the need for it.\n\n[^5]: Though note that Moller's own position is more moderate than what\n    the 'Might' Argument suggests; he thinks moral risk should play a\n    role in reasoning, but not necessarily so strong a role as to make\n    the 'Might' Argument go through. I'm advocating what he calls the\n    \"extreme view, we never need to take moral risk into account; it is\n    always permissible to take moral risks.\" (435).}\n\n[^6]: In @Weatherson2013diss I make a similar objection to normative\n    internalism in epistemology. It's this point of connection that's\n    made me focus on *normative* internalism and externalism, not\n    *moral* internalism and externalism. The issues in ethics and in\n    epistemology are very closely connected here.\n\n[^7]: The Huckleberry Finn case has been discussed extensively by Nomy\n    Arpaly and Timothy Schroeder\n     [@Arpaly2002; @Arpaly2003; @ArpalySchroeder1999; @ArpalySchroeder2014],\n    and I'm relying heavily on their analysis of the case in what I say\n    here and elsewhere about Huckleberry Finn. More generally, the\n    picture I'm assuming of moral motivation owes a lot to those works.\n\n[^8]: To be clear, I'm conceding that these motivations are consistent\n    with the argument of the paper. My own view is that while realising\n    that something violates the Golden Rule could be a motivation, as is\n    evident from how we teach morality to children, realising that it\n    violates the categorical imperative should not be motivating. But\n    the argument of the paper doesn't turn on my quirky views here. What\n    matters is that we distinguish wrongness itself from properties like\n    harming another person, not what other properties we group in with\n    wrongness.\n",
