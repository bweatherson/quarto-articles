In general, if the author says that p is true in the fiction we're reading, we believe that p is true in that fiction. And if we're playing along with the fictional game, we imagine that, along with everything else in the story, p is true. But there are exceptions to these general principles. Many authors, most notably Kendall Walton and Tamar Szabó Gendler, have discussed apparent counterexamples when p is \"morally deviant\". Many other statements that are conceptually impossible also seem to be counterexamples. In this paper I do four things. I survey the range of counterexamples, or at least putative counterexamples, to the principles. Then I look to explanations of the counterexamples. I argue, following Gendler, that the explanation cannot simply be that morally deviant claims are impossible. I argue that the distinctive attitudes we have towards moral propositions cannot explain the counterexamples, since some of the examples don't involve moral concepts. And I put forward a proposed explanation that turns on the role of 'higher-level concepts', concepts that if they are satisfied are satisfied in virtue of more fundamental facts about the world, in fiction, and in imagination.\ndate: November 1 2004\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\njournal: \n  title: \"Philosophers' Imprint\"\n  publisher: Michigan\nvolume: 4\nissue: 3\ncitation_url: http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3521354.0004.003\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\ncategories:\n  - ethics\n  - fiction\n  - metaphysics\nself-contained: false\npreview: freeway.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: TRUE\n---\n\n\n\n# Four Puzzles\n\nSeveral things go wrong in the following story.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in [Philosophers' Imprint](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/phimp/3521354.0004.003/1) 4:3.\n</aside>\n\n> *Death on a Freeway*\\\n> Jack and Jill were arguing again. This was not in itself unusual, but\n> this time they were standing in the fast lane of I-95 having their\n> argument. This was causing traffic to bank up a bit. It wasn't\n> significantly worse than normally happened around Providence, not that\n> you could have told that from the reactions of passing motorists. They\n> were convinced that Jack and Jill, and not the volume of traffic, were\n> the primary causes of the slowdown. They all forgot how bad traffic\n> normally is along there. When Craig saw that the cause of the bankup\n> had been Jack and Jill, he took his gun out of the glovebox and shot\n> them. People then started driving over their bodies, and while the new\n> speed hump caused some people to slow down a bit, mostly traffic\n> returned to its normal speed. So Craig did the right thing, because\n> Jack and Jill should have taken their argument somewhere else where\n> they wouldn't get in anyone's way.\n\n<aside>\nPicture via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/db21ca13-e39c-4b4f-967a-032297a12ab6).\n</aside>\n\nThe last sentence raises a few related puzzles. Intuitively, it is not\ntrue, even in the story, that Craig's murder was morally justified. What\nthe narrator tells us here is just false. That should be a little\nsurprising. We're being told a story, after all, so the storyteller\nshould be an authority on what's true in it. Here we hearers get to rule\non which moral claims are true and false, not the author. But usually\nthe author gets to say what's what. The action takes place in\nProvidence, on Highway 95, just because the author says so. And we don't\nreject those claims in the story just because no such murder has ever\ntaken place on Highway 95. False claims can generally be true in\nstories. Normally, the author's say so is enough to make it so, at least\nin the story, even if what is said is really false. The first puzzle,\nthe **alethic** puzzle, is why authorial authority breaks down in cases\nlike *Death on the Freeway*. Why can't the author just make sentences\nlike the last sentence in *Death* true in the story by saying they are\ntrue? At this stage I won't try and give a more precise characterisation\nof which features of *Death* lead to the break down of authorial\nauthority, for that will be at issue below.\n\n<aside>\nI've spoken to\n    practically everyone I know about the issues here, and a full list\n    of thanks for useful advice, suggestions, recommendations,\n    criticisms, counterexamples and encouragement would double the size\n    of the paper. If I thank philosophy departments rather than all the\n    individuals in them it might cut the size a little, so thanks to the\n    departments at Brown, UC Davis, Melbourne, MIT and Monash. Thanks\n    also to Kendall Walton, Tamar Gendler and two referees for\n    *Philosophers' Imprint*. The most useful assistance came from\n    Wolfgang Schwarz and especially Tyler Doggett, without whose advice\n    this could never have been written, and to George Wilson, who\n    prevented me from (keeping on) making a serious error of\n    over-generalisation.\n</aside>\n\nThe second puzzle concerns the relation between fiction and imagination.\nFollowing Kendall @Walton1990, it is common to construe fictional works\nas invitations to imagine. The author requests, or suggests, that we\nimagine a certain world. In *Death* we can follow along with the author\nfor most of the story. We can imagine an argument taking place in peak\nhour on Highway 95. We can imagine this frustrating the other drivers.\nAnd we can imagine one of those drivers retaliating with a loaded gun.\nWhat we cannot, or at least do not, imagine is that this retaliation is\nmorally justified. There is a limit to our imaginative ability here. We\nrefuse, fairly systematically, to play along with the author here. Call\nthis the **imaginative** puzzle. Why don't we play along in cases like\n*Death*? Again, I won't say *for now* which cases are like *Death*.\n\nThe third puzzle concerns the phenomenology of *Death* and stories like\nit. The final sentence is striking, jarring in a way that the earlier\nsentences are not. Presumably this is closely related to the earlier\npuzzles, though I'll argue below that the cases that generate this\npeculiar reaction are not identical with cases that generate alethic or\nimaginative puzzles. So call this the **phenomenological** puzzle.\n\nFinally, there is a puzzle that David @Hume1757 first noticed. Hume\nsuggested that artistic works that include morally deviant claims, moral\nclaims that wouldn't be true were the descriptive aspects of the story\ntrue, are thereby aesthetically compromised. Why is this so? Call that\nthe **aesthetic** puzzle. I will have nothing to say about that puzzle\nhere, though hopefully what I have to say about the other puzzles will\nassist in solving it.\n\nI'm going to call sentences that raise the first three puzzles\n**puzzling** sentences. Eventually I'll look at the small differences\nbetween those three puzzles, but for now we'll focus on what they have\nin common. The puzzles, especially the imaginative puzzle, have become\nquite a focus of debate in recent years. The aesthetic puzzle is raised\nby David @Hume1757, and is discussed by Kendall @Walton1994 and Richard\n@Moran1995. Walton and Moran also discuss the imaginative and alethic\npuzzles, and they are the focus of attention in recent work by Tamar\nSzabó @Gendler2000, Gregory @Currie2002 and Stephen @Yablo2002. My\nsolution to the puzzles is best thought of as a development of some of\nWalton's 'sketchy story' (to use his description). Gendler suggests one\nway to develop Walton's views, and shows it leads to an unacceptable\nsolution, because it leads to mistaken predictions. I will argue that\nthere are more modest developments of Walton's views that don't lead to\nso many predictions, and in particular don't lead to *mistaken*\npredictions, but which still say enough to solve the puzzles.\n\n# The Range of the Puzzles\n\nAs Walton and Yablo note, the puzzle does not only arise in connection\nwith thin moral concepts. But it has not been appreciated how widespread\nthe puzzle is, and getting a sense of this helps us narrow the range of\npossible solutions.\n\nSentences in stories attributing **thick moral concepts** can be\npuzzling. If my prose retelling of *Macbeth* included the line \"Then the\ncowardly Macduff called on the brave Macbeth to fight him face to face,\"\nthe reader would not accept that in the story Macduff was a coward. If\nmy retelling of *Hamlet* frequently described the young prince as\ndecisive, the reader would struggle to go along with me imaginatively.\nTry imagining Hamlet doing exactly what he does, and saying exactly what\nhe says, and thinking what he thinks, but always decisively. For an\nactual example, it's easy to find the first line in Bob Dylan's *Ballad\nof Frankie Lee and Judas Priest*, that the titular characters 'were the\nbest of friends' puzzling in the context of how Frankie Lee treats Judas\nPriest later in the song. It isn't too surprising that the puzzle\nextends to the thick moral concepts, and Walton at least doesn't even\nregard these as a separate category.\n\nMore interestingly, any kind of **evaluative** sentence can be puzzling.\nWalton and Yablo both discuss sentences attributing aesthetic\nproperties. [@Yablo2002 485] suggests that a story in which the author\ntalks about the sublime beauty of a monster truck rally, while\ncomplaining about the lack of aesthetic value in sunsets, is in most\nrespects like our morally deviant story. The salient aesthetic claims\nwill be puzzling. Note that we *are* able to imagine a community that\nprefers the sight of a 'blood bath death match of doom' (to use Yablo's\nevocative description) to sunsets over Sydney Harbour and it could\ncertainly be true in a fiction that such attitudes were commonplace. But\nthat does not imply that those people could be *right* in thinking the\ntrucks are more beautiful. [@Walton1994 43-44] notes that sentences\ndescribing jokes that are actually unfunny as being funny will be\npuzzling. We get to decide what is funny, not the author.\n\nWalton and Yablo's point here can be extended to **epistemic\nevaluations**. Again it isn't too hard to find puzzling examples when we\nlook at attributions of rationality or irrationality.\n\n> *Alien Robbery*\\\n> Sam saw his friend Lee Remnick rushing out of a bank carrying in one\n> hand a large bag with money falling out of the top and in the other\n> hand a sawn-off shotgun. Lee Remnick recognised Sam across the street\n> and waved with her gun hand, which frightened Sam a little. Sam was a\n> little shocked to see Lee do this, because despite a few childish\n> pranks involving stolen cars, she'd been fairly law abiding. So Sam\n> decided that it wasn't Lee, but really a shape-shifting alien that\n> looked like Lee, that robbed the bank. Although shape-shifting aliens\n> didn't exist, and until that moment Sam had no evidence that they did,\n> this was a rational belief. False, but rational.\n\nThe last two sentences of *Alien Robbery* are fairly clearly puzzling.\n\nSo far all of our examples have involved normative concepts, so one\nmight think the solution to the puzzle will have something to do with\nthe distinctive nature of normative concepts, or with their distinctive\nrole in fiction. Indeed, Gendler's and Currie's solutions have just this\nfeature. But sentences that seem somewhat removed from the realm of the\nnormative can still be puzzling. (It is of course contentious just where\nthe normative/non-normative barrier lies. Most of the following cases\nwill be regarded as involving normative concepts by at least some\nphilosophers. But I think few people will hold that *all* of the\nfollowing cases involve normative concepts.)\n\nAttributions of **mental states** can, in principle, be puzzling. If I\nretell *Romeo and Juliet*, and in this say 'Although he believed he\nloved Juliet, and acted as if he did, Romeo did not really love Juliet,\nand actually wanted to humiliate her by getting her to betray her\nfamily', that would I think be puzzling. This example is odd, because it\nis not obviously *impossible* that Romeo could fail to love Juliet even\nthough he thought he loved her (people are mistaken about this kind of\nthing all the time) and acted as if he did (especially if he was trying\nto trick her). But given the full detail of the story, it is impossible\nto imagine that Romeo thought he had the attitudes towards Juliet he is\ntraditionally thought to have, and he is mistaken about this.\n\nAttributions of **content**, either mental content or linguistic\ncontent, can be just as puzzling. The second and third sentences in this\nstory are impossible to imagine, and false even in the story.\n\n> *Cats and Dogs*\\\n> Rhodisland is much like a part of the actual world, but with a\n> surprising difference. Although they use the word 'cat' in all the\n> circumstances when we would (i.e. when they want to say something\n> about cats), and the word 'dog' in all the circumstances we would, in\n> their language 'cat' means dog and 'dog' means cat. None of the\n> Rhodislanders are aware of this, so they frequently say false things\n> when asked about cats and dogs. Indeed, no one has ever known that\n> their words had this meaning, and they would probably investigate just\n> how this came to be in some detail, if they knew it were true.\n\nA similar story can be told to demonstrate how claims about mental\ncontent can be puzzling. Perhaps these cases still involve the\nnormative. Loving might be thought to entail special obligations and\n@Kripke1982 has argued that content is normative. But we are clearly\nmoving away from the moral, narrowly construed.\n\nStephen Yablo recently suggested that certain **shape** predicates\ngenerate imaginative resistance. These predicates are meant to be\nspecial categories of a broader category that we'll discuss further\nbelow. Here's Yablo's example.\n\n> *Game Over*\\\n> They flopped down beneath the giant maple. One more item to find, and\n> yet the game seemed lost. Hang on, Sally said. It's staring us in the\n> face. This is a *maple* tree we're under. She grabbed a five-fingered\n> leaf. Here was the oval they needed! They ran off to claim their\n> prize. [@Yablo2002 485, title added]\n\nThere's a potential complication in this story in that one might think\nthat it's metaphysically impossible that *maple* trees have ovular\nleaves. That's not what is meant to be resisted, and I don't think is\nresisted. What is resisted is that maple leaves have their distinctive\nfive-fingered look, that the shape of the leaf Sally collects is like\n*that* (imagine I demonstrate a maple leaf here) and that its shape be\nan *oval*.\n\nFewer people may care about the next class of cases, or have clear\nintuitions about them, but if one has firm **ontological** beliefs, then\ndeviant ontological claims can be puzzling. I'm a universalist about\nmereology, at least with respect to ordinary concrete things, so I find\nmany of the claims in this story puzzling.\n\n> *Wiggins' World*\\\n> The Hogwarts Express was a very special train. It had no parts at all.\n> Although you'd be tempted to say that it had carriages, an engine,\n> seats, wheels, windows and so on, it really was a mereological atom.\n> And it certainly had no temporal parts - it wholly was wherever and\n> whenever it was. Even more surprisingly, it did not enter into\n> fusions, so when the Hogwarts Local was linked to it for the first few\n> miles out of Kings Cross, there was no one object that carried all the\n> students through north London.\n\nI think that even in fictions any two concrete objects have a fusion. So\nthe Hogwarts Express and the Hogwarts Local have a fusion, and when it\nis a connected object it is commonly called a train. I know how to\ndescribe a situation where they have no fusion (I did so just above) but\nI have no idea how to *imagine* it, or make it true in a story.\n\nMore generally, there are all sorts of puzzling sentences involving\nclaims about **constitution**. These I think are the best guide to a\nsolution to the puzzle.\n\n> *A Quixotic Victory*\\\n> --What think you of my redecorating Sancho?\\\n> --It's rather sparse, said Sancho.\\\n> --Sparse. Indeed it is sparse. Just a television and an armchair.\\\n> --Where are they, Señor Quixote? asked Sancho. All I see are a knife\n> and fork on the floor, about six feet from each other. A sparse\n> apartment for a sparse mind. He said the last sentence under his\n> breath so Quixote would not hear him.\\\n> --They might look like a knife and fork, but they are a television and\n> an armchair, replied Quixote.\\\n> --They look just like the knife and fork I have in my pocket, said\n> Sancho, and he moved as to put his knife and fork besides the objects\n> on Quixote's floor.\\\n> --Please don't do that, said Quixote, for I may be unable to tell your\n> knife and fork from my television and armchair.\\\n> --But if you can't tell them apart from a knife and fork, how could\n> they be a television and an armchair?\\\n> --Do you really think *being a television* is an observational\n> property? asked Quixote with a grin.\\\n> --Maybe not. OK then, how do you change the channels? asked Sancho.\\\n> --There's a remote.\\\n> --Where? Is it that floorboard?\\\n> --No, it's at the repair shop, admitted Quixote.\\\n> --I give up, said Sancho.\\\n>\n> Sancho was right to give up. Despite their odd appearance, Quixote's\n> items of furniture really were a television and an armchair. This was\n> the first time in months Quixote had won an argument with Sancho.\n\nQuixote is quite right that whether something is a television is not\ndetermined entirely by how it looks. A television could be\nindistinguishable from a non-television. Nonetheless, something\nindistinguishable from a knife is not a television. Not in this world,\nand not in the world of *Victory* either, whatever the author says. For\nwhether something is a television is determined at least *in part* by\nhow it looks, and while it is impossible to provide a non-circular\nconstraint on how a television may look, it may not look like a common\nknife.\n\nIn general, if whether or not something is an *F* is determined in part\nby 'lower-level' features, such as the shape and organisation of its\nparts, and the story specifies that the lower-level features are\nincompatible with the object being an *F*, it is not an *F* in the\nfiction. Suitably generalised and qualified, I think this is the\nexplanation of all of the above categories. To understand better what\nthe generalisations and qualifications must be, we need to look at some\ncases that aren't like *Death*, and some alternative explanations of\nwhat is going on in *Death*.\n\nSentences that are **intentional errors** on the part of storytellers\nare not puzzling in our sense. We will use real examples for the next\nfew pages, starting with the opening line of Joyce's most famous short\nstory.\n\n> *The Dead*\\\n> Lily, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet.\\\n> [@Joyce1914 138]\n\nIt isn't true that Lily is *literally* run off her feet. She is run off\nher feet by the incoming guests, and if you asked her she may well say\nshe was literally run off her feet, but this would reveal as much about\nher lack of linguistic care as about her demanding routine. Is this a\ncase where the author loses authority over what's true in the story? No,\nwe are not meant to read the sentence as being true in the story, but\nbeing a faithful report of what Lily (in the story) might say to\nherself. In practice it's incredibly difficult to tell just when the\nauthor intends a sentence to be true in the story, as opposed to being a\nreport of some character's view of what is true. (See @Holton1997 for an\nillustration of the complications this can cause.) But since we are\noperating in theory here, we will assume *that* problem solved. The\nalethic puzzle only arises when it is clear that the author intends that\n*p* is true in her story, but we think *p* is not true. The imaginative\npuzzle only arises when the author invites us to imagine *p*, but we can\nnot, or at least do not. Since Joyce does not intend this sentence to be\ntrue in *The Dead*, nor invites us to imagine it being true, neither\npuzzle arises. What happens to the phenomenological puzzle in cases like\nthese is a little more interesting, and I'll return to that in .\n\nJust as intentional errors are not puzzling, **careless errors** are not\npuzzling. Writing a full length novel is a perilous business. Things can\ngo wrong. Words can be miswritten, mistyped or misprinted at several\ndifferent stages. Sometimes the errors are easily detectable, sometimes\nthey are not, especially when they concern names. In one of the drafts\nof *Ulysses*, Joyce managed to write \"Connolly Norman\" in place of\n\"Conolly Norman\". Had that draft being used for the canonical printing\nof the work, it would be tempting to say that we had another alethic\npuzzle. For the character named here is clearly the Superintendent of\nthe Richmond District Lunatic Asylum, and his name had no double-'n', so\nin the story there is no double-'n' either.[^2]\n\nHere we do have an instance where what is true in the story differs from\nthe what is written in the text. But this is not a particularly\n*interesting* deviation. To avoid arcane discussions of typographical\nerrors, we will that in every case we possess an ideal version of the\ntext, and are comparing it with the author's intentions. Slip-ups that\nwould be detected by a careful proof-reader, whether they reveal an\nunintended divergence between word and world, as here, or between\nvarious parts of the text, as would happen if Dr Norman were not named\nafter a real person but had his name spelled differently in parts of the\ntext, will be ignored.[^3]\n\nNote two ways in which the puzzles as I have stated them are narrower\nthan they first appear. First, I am only considering puzzles that arise\nfrom a particular sentence in the story, intentionally presented in the\nvoice of an authoritative narrator. We could try and generalise, asking\nwhy it is that we sometimes (but not always) question the moral claims\nthat are intended to be tacit in a work of fiction. For instance, we\nmight hold that for some Shakespearean plays there are moral\npropositions that Shakespeare intended to be true in the play, but which\nare not in fact true. Such cases are interesting, but to keep the\nproblem of manageable proportions I won't explicitly discuss them here.\n(I believe the solution I offer here generalises to those cases, but I\nwon't defend that claim here.) Second, all the stories I have discussed\nare either paragraph-long examples, or relatively detachable parts of\nlonger stories. For all I've said so far, the puzzle *may* be restricted\nto such cases. In particular, it might be the case that a suitably\ntalented author could make it true in a story that killing people for\nholding up traffic is morally praiseworthy, or that a television is\nphenomenally and functionally indistinguishable from a knife. What we've\nseen so far is just that an author cannot make these things true in a\nstory simply by saying they are true.[^4] I leave open the question of\nwhether a more subtle approach could make those things true in a\nfiction. Similarly, I leave it open whether a more detailed invitation\nto imagine that these things are true would be accepted. All we have\nseen so far is that simple direct invitations to imagine these things\nare rejected, and it feels like we could not accept them.\n\n# An Impossible Solution\n\nHere's a natural solution to the puzzles, one that you may have been\nwaiting for me to discuss. The alethic puzzle arises because only\npropositions that are possibly true can be true in a story, or can be\nimagined. The latter claim rests on the hypothesis that we can imagine\nonly what is possible, and that we resist imagining what is impossible.\n\nThis solution assumes that it is *impossible* that killing people for\nholding up freeway traffic is the right thing to do. Given enough\nbackground assumptions, that *is* plausible. It is plausible, that is,\nthat the moral facts supervene on the non-moral facts. And the\nsupervenience principle here is quite a strong one - in *every* possible\nworld where the descriptive facts are thus and so, the moral facts are\nthe same way.[^5] If we assume the relevant concept of impossibility is\ntruth in no possible worlds, we get the nice result that the moral\nclaims at the core of the problem could not possibly be true.\n\nSeveral authors have discussed solutions around this area. Kendall\n@Walton1994 can easily be read as endorsing this solution, though\nWalton's discussion is rather tentative. Tamar Szabó Gendler rejects the\ntheory, but thinks it is the most natural idea, and spends much of her\npaper arguing against this solution. As those authors, and Gregory\n@Currie2002, note, the solution needs to be tidied up a little before it\nwill work for the phenomenological and imaginative puzzles. (It is less\nclear whether the tidying matters to the alethic puzzle.) For one thing,\nthere is no felt asymmetry between a story containing, \"Alex proved the\ntwin primes theorem,\" and one containing, \"Alex found the largest pair\nof twin primes,\" even though *one of them* is impossible. Since we don't\nknow which it is, the impossibility of the false one cannot help us\nhere. So the theory must be that it is believed impossibilities that\nmatter, for determining what we can imagine, not just any old\nimpossibilities. Presumably impossibilities that are not salient will\nalso not prevent imagination.\n\nEven thus qualified, the solution still overgenerates, as Gendler noted.\nThere are stories that are not puzzling in any way that contain known\nsalient impossibilities. Gendler suggests three kinds of cases of this\nkind, of which I think only the third *clearly* works. The first kind of\ncase is where we have direct contradictions true in the story. Gendler\nsuggests that her *Tower of Goldbach* story, where seven plus five both\ndoes and does not equal twelve, is not puzzling. Graham @Priest1999\nmakes a similar point with a story, *Sylvan's Box*, involving an empty\nbox with a small statue in one corner. These are clear cases of known,\nsalient impossibility, but arguably are not puzzling in any respect.\n(There is a distinction between the puzzles though. It is very plausible\nto say that it's true in Priest's story that there's an empty box with a\nsmall statue in one corner. It is less plausible to say we really can\nimagine such a situation.) Opinion about such cases tends to be fairly\nsharply divided, and it is not good I suspect to rest too much weight on\nthem one way or the other.\n\nThe second kind of case Gendler suggests is where we have a\ndistinctively metaphysical impossibility, such as a singing snowman or a\ntalking playing card. Similar cases as discussed by Alex @Byrne1993 who\ntakes them to raise problems for David Lewis's [-@Lewis1978b]\nsubjunctive conditionals account of truth in fiction. If we believe a\nstrong enough kind of essentialism, then these will be impossible, but\nthey clearly do not generate puzzling stories. For a quick proof of\nthis, note that *Alice in Wonderland* is not puzzling, but several\nessentialist theses are violated there. It is true in *Alice in\nWonderland*, for example, that playing cards plant rose trees.\n\nBut these examples don't strike me as particularly convincing either.\nFor one thing, the essentialism assumed here may be wrong. For another,\nthe essentialism might not be both salient and believed to be right,\nwhich is what is needed. And most importantly, we can easily reinterpret\nwhat the authors are saying in order to be make the story possibly true.\nWe can assume, for example, that the rosebush planting playing cards are\nnot *playing cards* as we know them, but roughly human-shaped beings\nwith playing cards for torsos. Gendler and Byrne each say that this is\nto misinterpret the author, but I'm not sure this is true. As some\nevidence, note that the authorised illustrations in *Alice* tend to\nsupport the reinterpretations.[^6]\n\nGendler's third case is better. There are science fiction stories,\nespecially time travel stories, that are clearly impossible but which do\nnot generate resistance. Here's two such stories, the first lightly\nmodified from a surprisingly popular movie, and the second lifted\nstraight from a very popular source.\n\n> *Back to the Future$^\\prime$*\\\n> Marty McFly unintentionally travelled back in time to escape some\n> marauding Libyan terrorists. In doing so he prevented the chance\n> meeting which had, in the timeline that had been, caused his father\n> and mother to start dating. Without that event, his mother saw no\n> reason to date the unattractive, boring nerdy kid who had been, in a\n> history that no longer is, Marty's father. So Marty never came into\n> existence. This was really a neat trick on Marty's part, though he was\n> of course no longer around to appreciate it. Some people manage to\n> remove themselves from the future of the world by foolish actions\n> involving cars.

Perhaps it's hard to imagine the last\ncouple of sentences of the McFly story, but everything the respective\nauthors say is true in their stories. So the impossibility theory cannot\nbe right, because it overgenerates, just as Gendler said.\n\nRecently Kathleen @Stock2003 has argued that one of the assumptions that\nGendler makes, specifically that it isn't true that \"a judgement of\nconceptual impossibility renders a scenario unimaginable\" [@Gendler2000\n66] is false. Even if Stock is right, this doesn't threaten the kind of\nresponse that I have (following Gendler) offered to the puzzles. But\nactually there are a few reasons to doubt Stock's reply. I'll discuss\nthese points in order.\n\nIt isn't entirely clear from Stock's discussion what she is taking a\nconceptual impossibility to be. I *think* it is a proposition of the\nform *Some F is a G* (or *That F is a G*, or something of this sort)\nwhere it is constitutive of being an *F* that the *F* is not a *G*.\nThere is no positive characterisation of conceptual impossibility in\nStock's paper, but it is clearly meant to be something stronger than\nmere impossibility, or a priori falsehood. In any case, most of the core\narguments turn on worries about allegedly deploying a concept while\nrefusing to draw inferences that are constitutive of that concept, so\nthe kind of definition I've offered above seems to be on the right\ntrack.\n\nNow if this is the case then Stock has no objection to the imaginability\nof the two stories I offered that involve known and salient\nimpossibilities. For neither of these stories includes a conceptual\nimpossibility in this sense. So even if conceptual impossibilities\ncannot be imagined, some impossibilities can be imagined. (And at this\npoint what holds for imagination also holds for truth in fiction.)\n\nWhile this suffices as a response to the particular claims Stock makes,\nit might be thought it undercuts the objection I have made to the\nimpossible solution. For it might be thought that what is wrong with the\npuzzling sentences just is that they represent *conceptual*\nimpossibilities in this sense, and we have no argument that these can be\nimagined, or true in fiction. This is not too far removed from the\nactual solution I will offer, so it is a serious worry. The problem with\nthis line is that not all of our puzzles are conceptual impossibilities.\nIt isn't constitutive of being a television that a thing is phenomenally\nor functionally distinguishable from a knife, but the claim in *Victory*\nthat some television is not phenomenally or functionally distinguishable\nfrom a knife is puzzling. Even in our core cases, of morally deviant\nclaims in fiction, there need not be any conceptual impossibilities. As\nR. M. @Hare1951 pointed out long ago, people with very different moral\nbeliefs could have in common the concept GOOD. Arguably, someone who\nthinks that what Craig does in *Death* is good is morally confused, not\nconceptually confused. So whether Gendler or Stock is right about the\nimaginability of conceptual impossibility is neither here nor there with\nrespect to these puzzles.\n\nHaving said that, there are some reasons to doubt Stock's argument. One\nof her moves is to argue that we couldn't imagine conceptual\nimpossibilities because we can't believe conceptual impossibilities. But\nas @Sorensen2001 persuasively argues, we *can* believe conceptual\nimpossibilities. One of Sorensen's arguments, lightly modified, helps us\nrespond to another of Stock's arguments. Stock notes, rightly, that we\nshouldn't take the fact that it *seems* we can imagine impossibilities\nto be conclusive evidence we can do so. After all, we are wrong about\nwhether things are as they seem all the time. But this might be a\nspecial case. I think that if it seems to be the case that *p* then we\ncan imagine that *p*. And Stock agrees it *seems* to be the case that we\ncan imagine conceptual impossibilities. So we can imagine that we can\nimagine conceptual impossibilities. Hence it can't be a conceptual\nimpossibility that we can imagine at least one conceptual impossibility.\nThis doesn't tell against the claim that it is some other kind of\nimpossibility, though as we'll see Stock's main argument rests on\nconsiderations about the conceptual structure of imagination, so it\nisn't clear how she could argue for this.\n\nThe main argument Stock offers is that no account of how concepts work\nare compatible with our imagining conceptual impossibilities. Her\nargument that atomist theories of concepts (as in @Fodor1998) are\nincompatible with imagining conceptual impossibilities isn't that\npersuasive. She writes that \"clearly it is not the case that imagining\n\"the cow jumped over the moon\" stands in a lawful relation to the\nproperty of being a cow (let alone the property of \\[being\\] a cow\njumping over the moon. Imagining by its very nature is resistant to any\nattempt to incorporate it into an externalist theory of content\"\n[-@Stock2003 114]. But this isn't clear at all. When I imagine going out\ndrinking with Bill Clinton there is, indeed there must be, some kind of\ncausal chain running back from my imagining to Bill Clinton himself. If\nthere was not, I'd at most be imagining going out drinking with a guy\nwho looks a lot like Bill Clinton. Perhaps it isn't as clear, but when I\nimagine that a cow (and not just a zebra disguised to look like a cow)\nis jumping over the moon it's nomologically necessary that there's a\ncausal chain of the right kind stretching back to actual cows. And it's\narguable that the concept I deploy in imagining that a cow (a real\n*cow*) is jumping over the moon just is the concept whose content is\nfixed by the lawful connections between various cows and my (initial)\ndeployment of it. So I don't see why a conceptual atomist should find\nthis kind of argument convincing.\n\nStock's response to Gendler was presented at a conference on Imagination\nand the Arts at Leeds in 2001, and at the same conference Derek\n@Matravers2003 offered an alternative solution to the alethic puzzle.\nAlthough it does not rest on claims about impossibility, it also suffers\nfrom an overgeneration problem. Matravers suggests that in at least some\nfictions, we treat the text as a report by a (fictional) narrator\nconcerning what is going on in a faraway land. Now in reality when we\nhear reports from generally trustworthy foreign correspondents, we are\nlikely to believe their descriptive claims about the facts on the\nground. Since they have travelled to the lands in question, and we have\nnot, the correspondent is epistemologically privileged with respect to\nthose facts on the ground. But when the correspondent makes moral\nevaluations of those facts, she is not in a privileged position, so we\ndon't just take her claims as the final word. Matravers suggests there\nare analogous limits to how far we trust a fictional narrator.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that there are several salient\ndisanalogies between the position of the correspondent and the fictional\nnarrator. The following case, which I heard about from Mark Liberman,\nillustrates this nicely. On March 5, 2004, the BBC reported that\nchildren in a nursery in England had found a frog with three heads and\nsix legs. Many people, including Professor Liberman, were sceptical,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the BBC was actually in England and\nProfessor Liberman was not. The epistemological privilege generated by\nproximity doesn't extend to implausible claims about three-headed frogs.\nThe obvious disanalogy is that if a fictional narrator said that there\nwas a three-headed six-legged frog in the children's nursery then other\nthings being equal we would infer it is true in the fiction that there\nwas indeed a three-headed six-legged frog in the children's nursery.[^7]\nSo there isn't an easy analogy between when we trust foreign\ncorrespondents and fictional narrators. Now we need an explanation of\nwhy the analogy does hold when either party makes morally deviant\nclaims, even though it doesn't when they both make biologically deviant\nclaims. But it doesn't seem any easier to say why the analogy holds then\nthan it is to solve the original puzzle.\n\nTwo other quick points about Matravers's solution. It's going to be a\nlittle delicate to extend this solution to all the cases I have\ndiscussed above, for normally we do think fictional narrators are\nprivileged with respect to where the televisions and windows are. What\nmatters here is that how far narratorial privilege extends depends on\nwhat other claims the narrator makes. Perhaps the same is true of\nforeign correspondents, though we'd need to see an argument for that.\nSecond, it isn't clear how this solution could possibly generalise to\ncover cases, such as frequently occurs in plays, where the deviant moral\nclaim is clearly intended by the author to be true in the fiction but\nthe reader (or watcher) does not agree even though the author's\nintention is recognised. As I mentioned at the start, these cases aren't\nour concern here, though it would be nice to see how a generalisation to\nthese cases is possible. But the primary problem with Matravers's\nsolution is that as it stands it (improperly) rules out three-headed\nfrogs in fiction, and it is hard to see how to remedy this problem\nwithout solving the original puzzle.\n\n# Some Ethical Solutions\n\nIf one focuses on cases like *Death*, it is natural to think the puzzle\nprobably has something to do with the special nature of ethical\npredicates, or perhaps of ethical concepts, or perhaps of the role of\neither of these in fiction. I don't think any such solution can work\nbecause it can't explain what goes wrong in *Victory*, and this will\nrecur as an objection in what follows.\n\nThe most detailed solution to the puzzles has been put forward by Tamar\nSzabó Gendler. She focuses on the imaginative puzzle, but she also makes\nvaluable points about the other puzzles. My solution to the\nphenomenological puzzle is basically hers plus a little epicycle.\n\nShe says that we do not imagine morally deviant fictional worlds because\nof our \"general desire to not be manipulated into taking on points of\nview that we would not reflectively endorse as our own.\" How could we\ntake on a point of view by accepting something in a fiction? Because of\nthe phenomena noted above that some things become true in a story\n*because* they are true in the world. If this is right, its converse\nmust be true as well. If what is true in the story must match what is\ntrue in the world, then to accept that something is true in the story\njust is to accept that it is true in the world. Arguably, the same kind\nof 'import/export' principles hold for imagination as for truth in\nfiction. Some propositions become part of the content of an imagining\nbecause they are true. So, in the right circumstances, they will only be\npart of an imagining if they are true. Hence to imagine them (in the\nright circumstances) is to commit oneself to their truth. Gendler holds\nthat we are sensitive to this phenomena, and that we refuse to accept\nstories that are morally deviant because that would involve accepting\nthat morally deviant claims are true in the world.\n\nThat's a relatively rough description of Gendler's theory, but it says\nenough to illustrate what she has in mind, and to show where two\nobjections may slip in. First, it is not clear that it generalises to\nall the cases. Gendler is aware of some of these cases and just bites\nthe relevant bullets. She holds, for instance, that we can imagine that\nactually lame jokes are funny, and it could be true in a story that such\na joke is funny. It would be a serious cost to her theory if she had to\nsay the same thing about *all* the examples discussed above.\n\nThe second problem is more serious. The solution is only as good as the\nclaim that moral claims are more easily exported than descriptive\nclaims, and more generally that the types of claims we won't imagine are\nmore easily exported than those we don't resist. Gendler has two\narguments for why the first of these should be true, but neither of them\nsounds persuasive. First, she says that the moral claims are true in all\npossible worlds if true at all. But this won't do on its own, because\n*as she proved*, we don't resist some necessarily false claims. (This\nobjection is also made by [@Matravers2003 94].)\n\nSecondly, she claims that in other cases where there are necessary\nfalsehoods true in a story, as in *Alice in Wonderland*, or the science\nfiction cases, the author makes it clear that unusual export\nrestrictions are being imposed. But this is wrong for two reasons.\nFirst, I don't think that any particularly clear signal to this effect\noccurs in my version of *Back to the Future*. Secondly, even if I had\nexplicitly signalled that I had intended to make some of the facts in\nthe story available for export, and you didn't believe that, that isn't\nenough reason to resist imagining the story. For my intent as to what\ncan and cannot be exported is not part of the story.\n\nTo see this, consider one relatively famous example. At one stage B. F.\nSkinner tried to promote behaviourism by weaving his theories into a\nnovel (of sorts): *Walden Two*. Now I'm sure @Skinner1948 intended us to\nexport some psychological and political claims from the story to the\nreal world. But it is entirely possible to read the story with full\nexport restrictions in force without rejecting that what Skinner says is\ntrue in that world. (It is dreadfully boring, since there's nothing but\npropagandising going on, but *possible*.) If exporting was the only\nbarrier here, we should be able to impose our own tariff walls and read\nthe story along, whatever the intent of the author, as we can with\n*Walden Two*. One can accept it is true in *Walden Two* that\nbehaviourism is the basis of a successful social policy, even though\nSkinner wants us to accept this as true in the story iff it is true in\nthe world, and it isn't true in the world. We cannot read *Death* or\n*Victory* with the same ironic detachment, and Gendler's theory lacks\nthe resources to explain this.\n\nCurrie's theory attacks the problem from a quite different direction. He\nrelies on the motivational consequences of accepting moral claims.\nAssume internalism about moral motivation, so to accept that\n${\\phi}$-ing is right is to be motivated to ${\\phi}$, at least ceteris\nparibus. So accepting that ${\\phi}$-ing is right involves acquiring a\ndesire to ${\\phi}$, as well, perhaps, as beliefs about ${\\phi}$-ing.\nCurrie suggests that there is a mental state that stands to desire the\nway that ordinary imagination stands to belief. It is, roughly, a state\nof having an off-line desire, in the way that imagining that *p* is like\nhaving an off-line belief that *p*, a state like a belief that *p* but\nwithout the motivational consequences. Currie suggests that imagining\nthat ${\\phi}$-ing is right involves off-line acceptance that\n${\\phi}$-ing is right, and that in part involves having an off-line\ndesire (a desire-like imagination) to ${\\phi}$. Finally, Currie says, it\nis harder to alter our off-line desires at will than it is to alter our\noff-line beliefs, and this explains the asymmetry. The argument for this\nlast claim seems very hasty, but we'll let that pass. For even if it is\ntrue, Currie's theory does little to explain the later cases of\nimaginative resistance, from *Alien* *Robbery* to *Victory*. It cannot\nexplain, why we have resistance to claims about what is rational to\nbelieve, or what is beautiful, or what attitudes other people have. The\nidea that there is a state that stands to desire as imagination stands\nto belief is I suspect a very fruitful one, but I don't think its fruits\ninclude a solution to these puzzles.\n\n# Grok\n\nStephen Yablo has suggested that the puzzles, or at least the\nimaginative puzzle, is closely linked to what he calls\n*response-enabled* concepts, or *grokking* concepts. (I'll also use\nresponse-enabled (grokking) as a property of the predicates that pick\nout these concepts.) These are introduced by examples, particularly by\nthe example 'oval'.\n\nHere are meant to be some platitudes about OVAL. It is a shape concept -\nany two objects in any two worlds, counterfactual or counteractual, that\nhave the same shape are alike in whether they are ovals. But which shape\nconcept it is is picked out by our reactions. They are the shapes that\nstrike us as being egg-like, or perhaps more formally, like the shape of\nall ellipses whose length/width ratio is the golden ratio. In this way\nthe concept OVAL meant to be distinguished on the one hand from, say,\nPRIME NUMBER, which is entirely independent of us, and from WATER, which\nwould have picked out a different chemical substance had our reactions\nto various chemicals been different. Note that what 'prime number' picks\nout is determined by us, like all semantic facts are. So the move space\ninto which OVAL is meant to fit is quite tiny. We matter to its\nextension, but not the way we matter to 'prime number' (or that we don't\nmatter to PRIME NUMBER), and not the way we matter to 'water'. I'm not\nsure there's any space here at all. To my ear, Yablo's grokking\npredicates strike me as words that have associated egocentric\ndescriptions that fix their reference without having egocentric\nreference fixing descriptions, and such words presumably don't exist.\nBut for present purposes I'll bracket those general concerns and see how\nthis idea can help solve the puzzles. For despite my disagreement about\nwhat these puzzles show about the theory of concepts, Yablo's solution\nis not too dissimilar to mine.\n\nThe important point for fiction about grokking concepts is that we\nmatter, in a non-constitutive way, for their extension. Not we as we\nmight have been, or we as we are in a story, but us. So an author can't\nsay that in the story squares looked egg-shaped to the people, so in the\nstory squares are ovals, because *we* get to say what's an oval, not\nsome fictional character. Here's how Yablo puts it:\n\n> Why should resistance \\[meaning, roughly, unimaginability\\] and\n> grokkingness be connected in this way? It's a feature of grokking\n> concepts that their extension in a situation depends on how the\n> situation does or would strike us. 'Does or would strike us' *as we\n> are*: how we are represented as reacting, or invited to react, has\n> nothing to do with it. Resistance is the natural consequence. If we\n> insist on judging the extension ourselves, it stands to reason that\n> any seeming intelligence coming from elsewhere is automatically\n> suspect. This applies in particular to being 'told' about the\n> extension by an as-if knowledgeable narrator. [-@Yablo2002 485]\n\nIt might look at first as if *Victory* will be a counterexample to\nYablo's solution, just as it is to the Ethical solutions. After all, the\nconcept that seems to generate the puzzles there is TELEVISION, and that\nisn't at all like his examples of grokking concepts. (The examples,\napart from evaluative concepts, are all shape concepts.) On the other\nhand, if there are any grokking concepts, perhaps it is plausible that\nTELEVISION should be one of them. Indeed, the platitudes about\nTELEVISION provide some support for this. (The following two paragraphs\nrely heavily on @Fodor1998.)\n\nThree platitudes about TELEVISION stand out. One is that it's very hard\nto define just what a television is. A second is that there's a striking\ncorrelation between people who have the concept TELEVISION and people\nwho have been acquainted with a television. Not a perfect correlation -\nsome infants have acquaintance with televisions but not as such, and\nsome people acquire TELEVISION by description - but still strikingly\nhigh. And a third is that conversations about televisions are rarely at\ncross purposes, even when they consist of people literally talking\ndifferent languages. TELEVISION is a shared concept.\n\nCan we put these into a theory of the concept TELEVISION? Fodor suggests\nwe can, as long as we are not looking for an analysis of TELEVISION.\nTelevisions are those things that strike us, people in general, as being\nsufficiently like the televisions we've seen, in a televisual kind of\nway. This isn't an account of the meaning of the word 'television' -\nthere's no reference to us in that word's dictionary entry, and rightly\nso. Nor is it an analysis of what constitutes the concept television.\nThere's no reference to us there either. But it does latch on to the\nright concept, or at least the right extension, in perhaps the only way\nwe could. And this proposal certainly explains the platitudes well. The\nepistemic necessity of having a paradigm television to use as a basis\nfor similarity judgments explains the striking correlation between\ntelevisual acquaintance and concept possession. The fact that the only\nway of picking out the extension uses something that is not constitutive\nof the concept, namely our reactions to televisions, explains why we\ncan't reductively analyse the concept. And the use of people's reactions\nin general rather than idiosyncratic reactions explains why its a common\nconcept. These look like good reasons to think something like Fodor's\ntheory of the concept TELEVISION is right, and if it is then TELEVISION\nseems to be response-enabled in Yablo's sense. So unlike the Ethical\nsolutions, Yablo's solution might yet predict that *Victory* will be\npuzzling.\n\nStill, I have three quibbles about his solution, and that's enough to\nmake me think a better solution may still to be found.\n\nFirst, there's a missing antecedent in a key sentence in his account,\nand it's hard to see how to fill it in. What does he mean when he says\n'how the situation does or would strike us'? Does or would strike us if\n*what*? If we were there? But we don't know where there is. There, in\n*Victory*, is allegedly a place where televisions look like knifes and\nforks. What if the antecedent is *If all the non-grokking descriptions\nwere accurate*? The problem now is that this will be too light. If\nTELEVISION is grokking, then there is a worry that many concepts,\nincluding perhaps all artefact concepts, will be grokking. Fodor didn't\nillustrate his theory with TELEVISION, he always used DOORKNOB. But the\ntheory was meant to be rather general. If we take out all the claims\ninvolving grokking concepts, there may not be much left.\n\nSecond, despite the generality of Fodor's account, it isn't clear that\nmental concepts, and content concepts, are grokking. We would need\nanother argument that LOVE is grokking, and that so is BELIEVING THAT\nTHERE ARE SPACE ALIENS. Perhaps such an argument can be given, but it\nwill not be a trivial exercise.\n\nFinally, I think this Yablo's solution, at least as most naturally\ninterpreted, overgeneralises. Here's a counterexample to it. The\nfollowing story is not, I take it, puzzling.\n\n> *Fixing a Hole*\\\n> DQ and his buddy SP leave DQ's apartment at midday Tuesday, leaving a\n> well-arranged lounge suite and home theatre unit, featuring DQ's\n> prized oval television. They travel back in time to Monday, where DQ\n> has some rather strange and unexpected adventures.

When DQ and his buddy SP get back to his apartment midday\n> Tuesday, it looks for all the world like there's nothing there except\n> an ordinary knife and fork.\n\nNow this situation would not strike us, were we to see it, as one where\nthere is a lounge suite and home theatre unit in DQ's apartment midday\nTuesday, for it looks as if there's an ordinary knife and fork there.\nBut still, the author gets to say that what's in DQ's apartment as the\nstory opens includes an oval television. And this despite the fact that\nthe two concepts, TELEVISION and OVAL, are grokking. Perhaps some\nepicycles could be added to Yablo's theory to solve this problem, but\nfor now the solution is incomplete.\n\n# Virtue\n\nThe content cases may remind us of one of Fodor's most famous lines\nabout meaning.\n\n> I suppose that sooner or later the physicists will complete the\n> catalogue they've been compiling of the ultimate and irreducible\n> properties of things. When they do, the likes of *spin*, *charm*, and\n> *charge* will perhaps appear on the list. But *aboutness* surely\n> won't; intentionality doesn't go that deep ... If the semantic and the\n> intentional are real properties of things, it must be in virtue of\n> their identity with (or maybe their supervenience on?) properties that\n> are themselves neither intentional nor semantic. If aboutness is real,\n> it must really be something else. [@Fodor1987 97]\n\nIf meaning doesn't go that deep, but there are meaning facts, then those\nfacts must hold in virtue of more fundamental facts. \"Molino de viento\"\nmeans windmill in Spanish in virtue of a pattern of usage of those words\nby Spanish speakers, for instance.\n\nIt seems that many of the stories above involve facts that hold, if they\nhold at all, in virtue of other facts. Had Fodor other interests than\nintentionality, he may have written instead that beauty doesn't go that\ndeep, and neither does television. If an event is to be beautiful, this\nis a fact that must obtain in virtue of other facts about it, perhaps\nits integrity, wholeness, symmetry and radiance as Aquinas says\n[@Joyce1944 212], and that event being a monster truck death match of\ndoom *probably* precludes those facts from obtaining.[^8] If Quixote's\nfavourite item of furniture is to be a television, this must be in\nvirtue of it filling certain functional roles, and being\nindistinguishable from a common knife probably precludes that.\n\nWhat is it for a fact to obtain in virtue of other facts obtaining? A\ngood question, but not one we will answer here. Still, the concept seems\nclear enough that we can still use it, as Fodor does. What we have in\nmind by 'virtue' is understandable from the examples. One thing to note\nfrom the top is that it is not just supervenience: whether *x* is good\nsupervenes on whether it is good, but it is not good *in virtue of*\nbeing good. How much our concept differs from supervenience is a little\ndelicate, but it certainly differs.\n\nReturning to our original example, moral properties are also less than\nperfectly fundamental. It is not a primitive fact that the butcher or\nthe baker is generous, but a fact that obtains in virtue of the way they\ntreat their neighbours. It is not a primitive fact that what Craig does\nis wrong, but a fact that obtains in virtue of the physical features of\nhis actions.\n\nHow are these virtuous relations relevant to the puzzles? To a first\napproximation, these relations are always imported into stories and into\nimagination. The puzzles arise when we try to tell stories or imagine\nscenes where they are violated. The rest of the paper will be concerned\nwith making this claim more precise, motivating it, and arguing that it\nsolves the puzzles. In making the claim precise, we will largely be\nqualifying it.\n\nThe first qualification follows from something we noted at the end of\nsection 2. We don't know whether puzzles like the ones with which we\nstarted arise whenever there is a clash between real-world morality (or\nepistemology or mereology) and the morality (or epistemology or\nmereology) the author tries to put in the story. We do know they arise\nfor simple stories and direct invitations to imagine. So if we aren't to\nmake claims that go beyond our evidence, we should say there is a\ndefault assumption that these relations are imported into stories or\nimaginations, and it is not easy to overcome this assumption. (I will\nsay for short there is a strong default assumption, meaning just that an\nauthor cannot cancel the assumption by saying so, and that we cannot\neasily follow invitations to imagine that violate the relations.)\n\nThe second qualification is that sometimes we simply ignore, either in\nfiction or imagination, what goes on at some levels of detail. This\nmeans that sometimes, in a sense, the relations are not imported into\nthe story. For instance, for it to really be true that in a language\nthat \"glory\" means *a nice knockdown argument*, this must be true in\nvirtue of facts about how the speakers of that language use, or are\ndisposed to use, \"glory\". But we can simply say in a story that \"glory\"\nin a character's language means *a nice knockdown argument* without\nthereby making any more general facts about usage or disposition to use\ntrue in the story.[^9] More generally, we can simply pick a level of\nconceptual complexity at which to write our story or conduct our\nimaginings. Even if those concepts apply, when they do, in virtue of\nmore basic facts, no more basic facts need be imported into the story.\nFor a more vivid, if more controversial, example, one might think that\ncows are cows in virtue of their DNA having certain chemical\ncharacteristics. But when we imagine a cow jumping over the moon, we\nneed not imagine anything about chemistry. Those facts are simply below\nthe radar of our imagining. What do we mean then when we say that these\nrelations are imported into the story? Just that if the story regards\nboth the higher-level facts and the lower-level facts as being within\nits purview, then they must match up. This does not rule out the\npossibility of simply leaving out all lower-level facts from the story.\nIn general the same thing is true for imagining, though we will look at\nsome cases below where we it seems there is a stronger constraint on\nimagining.\n\nThe third qualification is needed to handle an example pressed on me by\na referee. Recall our example *Fixing a Hole*.\n\n> *Fixing a Hole*\\\n> DQ and his buddy SP leave DQ's apartment at midday Tuesday, leaving a\n> well-arranged lounge suite and home theatre unit, featuring DQ's\n> prized oval television.

When DQ and his buddy SP get back to his apartment midday\n> Tuesday, it looks for all the world like there's nothing there except\n> an ordinary knife and fork.\n\nIn this story it seems that on Tuesday there is a television that looks\nexactly like a knife. If we interpret the claim about the relations\nbetween higher-level facts and the lower-level facts as a kind of\nimpossibility claim, e.g. as the claim that a conjunction\n*p* ${\\wedge}$ *q* is never true in a story if the conditional *If q,\nthen* *p* *is false in virtue of q being true* is true, then we have a\nproblem. Let *p* be the claim that there is a television, and let *q* be\nthe claim that the only things in the apartment looked life a knife and\nfork. If that's how the more basic phenomenal and functional facts are,\nthen there isn't a television in virtue of those facts. (That is, this\nrelation between phenomenal and functional facts and facts about where\nthe televisions are really holds.) So this rule would say\n*p* ${\\wedge}$ *q* could not be true in the story. But in fact\n*p* ${\\wedge}$ *q* is true in the story.\n\nThe difficulty here is that *Fixing a Hole* is a contradictory story,\nand contradictory stories need care. First, here's how we should\ninterpret the rule\n\n> *Virtue*\\\n> If *p* is the kind of claim that if true must be true in virtue of\n> lower-level facts, and if the story is about those lower-level facts,\n> then it must be true in the story that there is some true proposition\n> *r* which is about those lower-level facts such that *p* is true in\n> virtue of *r*.\n\nIn *Fixing a Hole* there are some true lower-level claims that are\ninconsistent with there being a television. But there is also in the\nstory a true proposition about how DQ's television looked before his\ntime-travel misadventure. And it is true (both in reality and in the\nstory) that something is a television in virtue of looking that way.\n(Note that we don't say there must be some proposition *r* that is true\nin the story in virtue of which *p* is true. For there is no fact of the\nmatter in *Fixing a Hole* about how DQ's television looked before he\nleft. So in reality we could not find such a proposition. But it is true\nin the story that his television looks some way or other, so as long as\nwe talk about what in the story is true, and don't quantify over\npropositions that are (in reality) true in the story, we avoid this\npitfall.)\n\nSo my solution to the alethic puzzle is that *Virtue* is a strong\ndefault principle of fictional interpretation. I haven't done much yet\nto motivate it, apart from noting that it seems to cover a lot of the\ncases that have been raised without overgenerating in the manner of the\nimpossible solution. A more positive motivation must wait until I have\npresented my solutions to the phenomenological and imaginative puzzles.\nI'll do that in the next section, then in tell a story about why we\nshould believe *Virtue*.\n\n# More Solutions\n\n### The Phenomenological Puzzle\n\nMy solution here is essentially the same as Gendler's. She think that\nwhen we strike a sentence that generated imaginative resistance we\nrespond with something like, \"That's what you think!\" What makes this\nnotable is that it's constitutive of playing the fiction game that we\nnot normally respond that we way, that we give the author some\nflexibility in setting up a world. I think that's basically right, but a\nlittle more is needed to put the puzzle to bed.\n\nSometimes the \"That's what you think!\" response does not constitute\nabandoning the fiction game. At times it is the only correct way to play\nthe game. It's the right thing to say *to Lily* when reading the first\nline of *The Dead*. (Maybe it would be rude to say it *aloud* to poor\nLily, the poor girl is run off her feet after all, but it's appropriate\nto think it.) This pattern recurs throughout *Dubliners*. When in\n*Eveline* the narrator says that Frank has sailed around the world, the\nright reaction is to say to Eveline (or whoever is narrating then),\n\"That's what you think!\" There's a cost to playing the game this way. We\nend up knowing next to nothing about Frank. But it is not as if making\nthe move stops us playing, or even stops us playing correctly. It's part\nof the point of *Eveline* that we know next to nothing about Frank.\n\nWhat makes cases like *Death* and *Victory* odd is that our reaction is\ndirected at someone who isn't in the story. One of Alex Byrne's\n[-@Byrne1993] criticisms of Lewis was that on Lewis's theory it is true\nin every story that the story is being told. Byrne argued that in many\nfictions it is not true that in the fictional world there is someone\nsufficiently knowledgeable to tell the story. In these fictions, we have\na story without a storyteller. If there are such stories, then\npresumably *Death* and *Victory* are amongst them. It is not a character\nin the story who ends by saying that Craig's action was right or that\nQuixote's apartment contains a television. The *author* says that, and\nhence deserves our reproach, but the author isn't in the story. Saying\n\"That's what you think!\" directly to him or her breaks the fictional\nspell for suddenly we have to recognise a character not in the fictional\nworld.\n\nThis proposal for the phenomenological puzzle yields a number of\npredictions which seem to be true and interesting. First, a story that\nhas a narrator should not generate a phenomenological puzzle, even when\noutlandish moral claims are made. The more prominent the narrator, the\nless striking the moral claim. Imagine, for example, a version of\n*Death* where the text purports to be Craig's diary, and it includes\nnaturally enough his own positive evaluation of what he did. We wouldn't\nbelieve him, of course, but we wouldn't be struck by the claim the same\nway we are in the actual version of *Death*.\n\nOne might have thought that what is shocking is what we discover about\nthe author. But this isn't right, as can be seen if we reflect on\nstories that contain Craig's diary. It is possible, difficult but\npossible, to embed the diary entry corresponding to *Death* in a longer\nstory where it is clear that the author endorses Craig's opinions.\n(Naturally I won't do this. Examples have to come to an end somewhere.)\nSuch a story would, in a way, be incredibly shocking. But it wouldn't\nmake the final line shocking in just the way that the final line of\n*Death* is shocking. Our reactions to these cases suggest that the\nstrikingness of the last line of *Death* is not a function of what it\nreveals about the author, but of how it reveals it.\n\nThe final prediction my theory makes is somewhat more contentious. Some\nnovels announce themselves as works of fiction. They go out of their way\nto prevent you ignoring the novel's role as mediation to a fictional\nworld. (For an early example of this, consider the sudden appearance of\nnewspaper headlines in the 'Aeolus' episode of *Ulysses*.) In such\nnovels we already have to recognise the author as a player in the\nfictional game, if not a character in the story. I predict that\nsentences where we do not take what is written to really be true in the\nstory, even though this is what the author intended, should be less\nstriking in these cases because we are already used to reacting to the\nauthor *as such* rather than just to the characters. Such books go out\nof their way to break the fictional spell, so spell breaking should\nmatter less in these cases. I think this prediction is correct, although\nthe works in question tend to be so complicated that it is hard to\ngenerate clear intuitions about them.\n\n### The Imaginative Puzzle\n\nImagine, if you will, a chair. Have you done so? Good. Let me make some\nguesses about what you imagined. First, it was a specific kind of chair.\nThere is a fact of the matter about whether the chair you imagined is,\nfor example, an armchair or a dining chair or a classroom chair or an\nairport lounge chair or an outdoor chair or an electric chair or a\nthrone. We can verbally represent something as being a chair without\nrepresenting it as being a specific kind of chair, but imagination\ncannot be quite so coarse.[^10]\n\nSecondly, what you imagined was incomplete in some respects. You\npossibly imagined a chair that if realised would contain some stitching\nsomewhere, but you did not imagine any details about the stitching.\nThere is no fact of the matter about how the chair you imagined holds\ntogether, if indeed it does. If you imagined a chair by imagining\nbumping into something chair-like in the dead of night, you need not\nhave imagined a chair of any colour, although in reality the chair would\nhave some colour or other.[^11]\n\nWere my guesses correct? Good. The little I needed to know about\nimagination to get those guesses right goes a long way towards solving\nthe puzzle.\n\nChairs are not very distinctive. Whenever we try to imagine that a\nnon-fundamental property is instantiated the content of our imagining\nwill be to some extent more specific than just that the object imagined\nhas the property, but not so much more specific as to amount to a\ncomplete description of a possibilia. It's the latter fact that does the\nwork in explaining how can imagine impossible situations. If we were,\nfoolishly, to try to fill in all the details of the impossible science\nfiction cases it would be clear they contained not just impossibilities,\nbut violations of *Virtue*, and then we would no longer be able to\nimagine them. But we can imagine the restaurant at the end of the\nuniverse without imagining it in all its glorious gory detail. And when\nwe do so our imagining appears to contain no such violations.\n\nBut why can't we imagine these violations in fictions? It is primarily\nbecause we can only imagine the higher-level claim some way or another,\njust as we only imagine a chair as some chair or other, and the\ninstructions that go along with the fiction forbid us from imagining\n*any* relevant lower-level facts that would constitute the truth of the\nhigher-level claim. We have not stressed it much above, but it is\nrelevant that fictions understood as invitations to imagine have a\n\"That's all\" clause.[^12] We are not imagining *Death* if we imagine\nthat Jack and Jill had just stopped arguing with each other and were\nabout to shoot everyone in sight when Craig shot them in self-defence.\nThe story does not explicitly say that wasn't about to happen. It\ndoesn't include a \"That's all\" clause. But such clauses have to be\nunderstood. So not only are we instructed to imagine something that\nseems incompatible with Craig's action being morally acceptable, we are\nalso instructed (tacitly) to *not* imagine anything that would make it\nthe case that his action is morally acceptable. But we can't simply\nimagine moral goodness in the abstract, to imagine it we have to imagine\na particular kind of goodness.\n\n### Two Thoughts Too Many?\n\nI have presented three solutions to the three different puzzles with\nwhich we started. Might it not be better to have a uniform solution? No,\nbecause although the puzzles are related, they are not identical. Three\npuzzles demand three solutions.\n\nWe saw already that the phenomenological puzzle is different to the\nother two. If we rewrite *Death* as Craig's diary there would be nothing\nparticularly striking about the last sentence, certainly in the context\nof the story as so told. But the last sentence generates alethic and\nimaginative puzzles. Or at least it could generate these puzzles if the\nauthor has made it clear elsewhere in the story that Craig's voice is\nauthoritative. So we shouldn't expect the same solution to that puzzle\nas the other two.\n\nThe alethic puzzle is different to the other two because ultimately it\ndepends on what the moral and conceptual truths are not on what we take\nthem to be. Consider the following story.\n\n> *The Benefactor*\\\n> Smith was a very generous, just and in every respect moral man. Every\n> month he held a giant feast for the village where they were able to\n> escape their usual diet of gains, fruits and vegetables to eat the\n> many and varied meats that Smith provided for them.\n\nConsider in particular, what should be easy to some, how *Benefactor*\nreads to someone who believes that we are morally required to be\nvegetarian if this is feasible. In *Benefactor* it is clear in the story\nthat most villagers can survive on a vegetarian diet. So it is morally\nwrong to serve them the many and varied meats that Smith does. Hence\nsuch a reader should disagree with the author's assessment that Smith is\nmoral 'in every respect'. Such a reader will think that in fact in the\nstory Smith is quite immoral in one important respect.\n\nNow for our final assumption. Assume it is really true that we morally\nshouldn't eat meat if it is avoidable. Since the ethical vegetarians\nhave true ethical beliefs about the salient facts here, it seems\nplausible that their views on what is true in the story should carry\nmore weight than ours. (I'm just relying on a general epistemological\nprinciple here: other things being equal trust the people who have true\nbeliefs about the relevant background facts.) So it seems that it really\nis false in the story that Smith is in every respect moral. *Benefactor*\nraises an alethic puzzle even though for non-vegetarians it does not\nraise a phenomenological or imaginative puzzle.\n\nThis point generalises, so we need not assume for the general point that\nvegetarianism is true or that our typical reader is not vegetarian. We\ncan be very confident that *some* of our ethical views will be wrong,\nthough for obvious reasons it is hard to say which ones. Let *p* be a\nfalse moral belief that we have. And let *S* be a story in which *p* is\nasserted by the (would-be omniscient) narrator. For reasons similar to\nwhat we said about *Benefactor*, *p* is not true in *S*. But *S* need\nnot raise any imaginative or phenomenological puzzles. Hence the alethic\npuzzle is different to the other two puzzles.\n\n# Why Virtue Matters\n\nI owe you an argument for why authors should be unable to easily\ngenerate violations of *Virtue*, though there is no general bar on\nmaking impossibilities true in a story. My general claims here are not\ntoo dissimilar to Yablo's solution to the puzzles, but there are a\ncouple of distinctive new points. Before we get to the argument, it's\ntime for another story.\n\nThree design students walk into an furniture showroom. The new season's\nfashions are all on display. The students are all struck by the *piece\nde resistance*, though they are all differently struck by it. Over\ndrinks later, it is revealed that while B and C thought it was a chair,\nA did not. But the differences did not end there. When asked to sketch\nthis contentious object, A and B produced identical sketches, while C's\nrecollections were drawn somewhat differently. B clearly disagrees with\nboth A and C, but her differences with each are quite different. With C\nshe disagrees on some simple empirical facts, what the object in\nquestion looked like. With A she disagrees on a conceptual fact, or\nperhaps a semantic fact, whether the concept CHAIR, or perhaps just the\nterm 'chair', applies to the object in question. As it turns out, A and\nB agree that 'chair' means CHAIR, and agree that CHAIR is a public\nconcept so one of them is right and the other wrong about whether this\nobject falls under the concept. In this case, their disagreement will\nhave a quite different feel to B's disagreement with C. It may well be\nthat there is no analytic/synthetic distinction, and that questions\nabout whether an object satisfies a concept are always empirical\nquestions, but this is not how it feels to A and B. They feel that they\nagree on what the world is like, or at least what this significant\nportion of it is like, and disagree just on which concepts apply to it.\n\nThe difference between these two kinds of disagreement is at the basis\nof our attitudes towards the alethic puzzle. It may look like we are\nseverely cramping authorial freedom by not permitting violations of\n*Virtue*.[^13] From A and B's perspective, however, this is no\nrestriction at all. Authors, they think, are free to stipulate which\nworld will be the site of their fiction. But as their disagreement about\nwhether the *piece de resistance* was a chair showed, we can agree about\nwhich world we are discussing and disagree about which concepts apply to\nit. The important point is that the metaphysics and epistemology of\nconcepts comes apart here.\n\nThere can be no difference in whether the concept CHAIR applies without\na difference in the underlying facts. But there can be a difference of\nopinion about whether a thing is a chair without a difference of opinion\nabout the underlying facts. The fact that it's the author's story, not\nthe reader's, means that the author gets to say what the underlying\nfacts are. But that still leaves the possibility for differences of\nopinion about whether there are chairs, and on that question the\nauthor's opinion is just another opinion.\n\nAuthorial authority extends as far as saying which world is fictional in\ntheir story, it does not extend as far as saying which concepts are\ninstantiated there. Since the main way that we specify which world is\nfictional is by specifying which concepts are instantiated at it,\nauthorial authority will usually let authors get away with any kind of\nconceptual claim. But once we have locked onto the world being\ndiscussed, the author has no special authority to say which concepts,\nespecially which higher-level concepts like RIGHT or FUNNY or CHAIR are\ninstantiated there.\n\n(Does it matter much that the distinction between empirical\ndisagreements and conceptual disagreements with which I started might\nturn out not to rest on very much? Not really. I am trying to explain\nwhy we have the attitudes towards fiction that we do, which in turn\ndetermines what is true in fiction generally. All that matters is that\npeople generally think that there is something like a conceptual\ntruth/empirical truth distinction, and I think enough people would agree\nthat A and B's disagreement is different in kind from B and C's\ndisagreement to show that is true. If folks are generally wrong about\nthis, if there is no difference in kind between conceptual truths and\nempirical truths, then our communal theory of truth in fiction will rest\non some fairly untenable supports. But it will still be our theory,\nalthough any coherent telling of it will have to be in terms of things\nthat are taken to be conceptual truths and things that are taken to be\nempirical truths.)\n\nThis explanation of why authorial authority collapses just when it does\nyields one fairly startling, and I think true, prediction. I argued\nabove that authors could not easily generate violations of *Virtue*.\nThat this is impossible is compatible with any number of hypotheses\nabout how readers will resolve those impossibilities that authors\nattempt to slip in. The story here, that authors get to say which world\nis at issue but not which concepts apply to it, yields the prediction\nthat readers will resolve the tension in favour of the lower-level\nclaims. When given a physical description of a world and an incompatible\nmoral description, we will take the physical description to fix which\nworld is at issue and reduce the moral description to a series of\nquestionable claims about the world. Compare what happens with A, B and\nC. We take A and B to agree about the world and disagree about concepts,\nrather than say taking B and C to agree about what the world is like\n(there's a chair at the heart of the furniture show) and say that A and\nB disagree about the application of some recognitional concepts. This\nprediction is borne out in every case discussed in . We do not conclude\nthat Craig did not really shoot Jack and Jill, because after all the\nworld at issue is stipulated to be one where he did the right thing.\nEven more surprisingly, we do not conclude that Quixote's furniture does\nnot look like kitchen utensils, because it consists of a television and\nan armchair. This is surprising because in *Victory* I never said that\nthe furniture looked like kitchen utensils. The *tacit* low-level claim\nabout appearances is given precedence over the *explicit* high-level\nclaims about which objects populate Quixote's apartment. The theory\nsketched here predicts that, and supports the solution to the alethic\npuzzle sketched in , which is good news for both the theory and the\nsolution.\n\nIt's been a running theme here that the puzzles do not have anything\nparticularly to do with normativity. But some normative concepts raise\nthe kind of issues about authority mentioned here in a particularly\nstriking way. There is always some division of cognitive labour in\nfiction. The author's role is, among other things, to say which world is\nbeing made fictional. The audience's role is, among other things, to\ndetermine the artistic merit of the fictional work. On other points\nthere may be some sharing of roles, but this division is fairly\nabsolute. The division threatens to collapse when authors start\ncommenting on the aesthetic quality of words produced by their\ncharacters. At the end of *Ivy Day in the Committee Room* Joyce has one\ncharacter describe a poem just recited by another character as \"A fine\npiece of writing\" [@Joyce1914 105]. Most critics seem to be happy to\n*accept* the line, because Joyce's poem here really is, apparently, a\nfine piece of writing. But to me it seems rather jarring, even if it\nhappens to be true. It's easy to feel a similar reaction when characters\nin a drama praise the words of another character.[^14] This is a\nspecial, and especially vivid, illustration of the point I've been\npushing towards here. The author gets to describe the world at whichever\nlevel of detail she chooses. But once it has been described, the reader\nhas just as much say in which higher-level concepts apply to parts of\nthat world. When the concepts are evaluative concepts that directly\nreflect on the author, the reader's role rises from being an equal to\nhaving more say than the author, just as we normally have less say than\nothers about which evaluative concepts apply to us.\n\nThis idea is obviously similar to Yablo's point that we get to decide\nwhen grokking concepts apply, not the author. But it isn't quite the\nsame. I think that if any concepts are grokking, most concepts are, so\nit can't be the case that authors never get to say when grokking\nconcepts apply in their stories. Most of the time authors will get to\nsay which grokking concepts apply, because they have to use them to tell\nus about the world. What's special about the kind of concepts that cause\npuzzles is that we get to decide when they apply full stop, but that we\nget to decide how they apply *given how more fundamental concepts\napply*. So the conciliatory version of the relation between my picture\nhere and Yablo's is that I've been filling in, in rather laborious\ndetail, his missing antecedent.\n\n# Two Hard Cases\n\nThe first hard case is suggested by Kendall @Walton1994. Try to imagine\na world where the over-riding moral duty is to maximise the amount of\nnutmeg in the world. If you are like me, you will find this something of\na challenge. Now consider a story *Nutmeg* that reads (in its\nentirety!): \"Nobody ever discovered this, but it turned out all along\ntheir over-riding moral duty was to maximise the amount of nutmeg in the\nworld.\" What is true in *Nutmeg*? It seems that there are no violations\nof *Virtue* here, but it is hard to imagine what is being described.\n\nThe second hard case is suggested by Tamar Szabó @Gendler2000. (I'm\nsimplifying this case a little, but it's still hard.) In her *Tower of\nGoldbach*, God decrees that 12 shall no longer be the sum of two primes,\nand from this it follows (even in the story) that it is not the sum of 7\nand 5. (It is not clear why He didn't just make 5 no longer prime - say\nthe product of 68 and 57. That may have been simpler.) Interestingly,\nthis has practical consequences. When a group of seven mathematicians\nfrom one city attempts to join a group of five from another city, they\nno longer form a group of twelve. Again, two questions. Can we imagine a\nGoldbachian situation, where 7 and 5 equal not 12? Is it true in\nGendler's story that 7 and 5 equal not 12? If we cannot imagine\nGoldbach's tower, where is the violation of *Virtue*?\n\nFirst a quick statement of my responses to the two cases then I'll end\nwith my detailed responses. To respond properly we need to tease apart\nthe alethic and imaginative puzzles. I claim that the alethic puzzle\nonly arises when there's a violation of *Virtue*. There's no violation\nin either story, so there is no alethic puzzle. I think there are\nindependent arguments for this conclusion in both cases. We can't\nimagine either (if we can't) because any way of filling in the more\nbasic facts leads to violations.\n\nIt follows from my solution to the alethic puzzle that Nutmegism (Tyler\nDoggett's name for the principle that we must maximise quantities of\nnutmeg) could be true in a story. There is no violation in *Nutmeg*,\nsince there are no lower level claims made. Still, the story is very\nhard to imagine. The reason for this is quite simple. As noted, we\ncannot just imagine a chair, we have to imagine something more detailed\nthat is a chair in virtue of its more basic properties. (There is no\nparticular more basic property we need imagine, as is shown by the fact\nthat we can imagine a chair just by imagining something with a certain\nlook, or we can imagine a chair in the dark with no visual\ncharacteristics. But there is always *something* more basic.) Similarly\nto imagine a duty, we have to imagine something more detailed, in this\ncase presumably a society or an ecology, in virtue of which the duty\nexists. But no such possible, or even impossible, society readily\nsprings to mind. So we cannot imagine Nutmegism is true.\n\nBut it is hard to see how, or why, this inability should be raised into\na restriction on what can be true in a story. One might think that what\nis wrong with *Nutmeg* is that the fictional world is picked out using\nhigh-level predicates. If we extend the story *any way at all*, the\nthought might go, we will generate a violation of *Virtue*. And that is\nenough to say that Nutmegism is not true in the story. But actually this\nisn't quite right. If we extend the story by adding more *moral* claims,\nthere is no duty to minimise suffering, there is no duty to help the\npoor etc, there are still no violations in the story. The restriction we\nwould have to impose is that there is no way of extending the story to\nfill out the facts in virtue of which the described facts obtain,\nwithout generating a violation. But that looks like too strong a\nconstraint, mostly because if we applied it here, to rule out Nutmegism\nbeing true in *Nutmeg*, we would have to apply it to every story written\nin a higher level language than that of microphysics. It doesn't *seem*\ntrue that we have to be able to continue a story all the way to the\nmicrophysical before we can be confident that what the author says\nabout, for instance, where the furniture in the room is. So there's no\nreason to not take the author's word in *Nutmeg*, and since the default\nis always that what the author says is true, Nutmegism is true in the\nstory.\n\nThe mathematical case is more difficult. The argument that 7 and 5 could\nfail to equal 12 in the story turns on an example by Gregory\n@Currie1990. (The main conclusions of this example are also endorsed by\n@Byrne1993.) Currie imagines a story in which the hero refutes Gödel's\nIncompleteness Theorem. Currie argues that the story could be written in\nsuch a way that it is true in the story not merely that everyone\nbelieves our hero refuted Gödel, but that she really did. But if it\ncould be true in a story that Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem could be\nfalse, then it's hard to see just why it could not be true in a story\nthat a simpler arithmetic claim, say that 7 and 5 make 12, could also be\nfalse. Anything that can't be true in a story can't be true in virtue of\nsome feature it has. The only difference between Gödel's Incompleteness\nTheorem and a simple arithmetic statement appears to be the simplicity\nof the simple statement. And it doesn't seem possible, or advisable, to\nwork that kind of feature into a theory of truth in fiction.\n\nThe core problem here is that how simple a mathematical impossibility is\nvery much a function of the reader's mathematical knowledge and acumen.\nSome readers probably find the unique prime factorisation theorem so\nsimple and evident that for them a story in which it is false is as\ncrashingly bad as a story in which 7 and 5 do not make 12. For other\nreaders, it is so complex that a story in which it has a counterexample\nis no more implausible than a story in which Gödel is refuted. I think\nit cannot be true for the second reader that the unique prime\nfactorisation theorem fails in the story and false for the first reader.\nThat amounts to a kind of relativism about truth in fiction that seems\npreposterous. But I agree with Currie that some mathematical\nimpossibilities can be true in a fiction. So I conclude that, whether it\nis imaginable or not, it could be true in a story that 7 and 5 not equal\n12.\n\nI think, however, that it is impossible to imagine that 7 plus 5 doesn't\nequal 12. Can we explain that unimaginability in the same way we\nexplained why *Nutmeg* couldn't be imagined? I think we can. It seems\nthat the sum of 7 and 5 is what it is in virtue of the relations between\n7, 5 and other numbers. It is not primitive that various sums take the\nvalues they take. That would be inconsistent with, for example, it being\nconstitutive of addition that it's associative, and associativity does\nseem to be constitutive of addition. We cannot think about 7, 5, 12 and\naddition without thinking about those more primitive relations. So we\ncannot imagine 7 and 5 equally anything else. Or so I think. There's\nsome rather sophisticated, or at least complicated, philosophy of\nmathematics in the story here, and not everyone will accept all of it.\nSo we should predict that not everyone will think that these arithmetic\nclaims are unimaginable. And, pleasingly, not everyone does. Gendler,\nfor instance, takes it as a data point that *Tower of Goldbach* is\nimaginable. So far so good. Unfortunately, if the story is true we\nshould also expect that whether people find the story imaginable links\nup with the various philosophies of mathematics they believe. And the\nevidence for that is thin. So there may be more work to do here. But\nthere is clearly *a* story that we can tell that handles the case.\n\n[^2]: For details on the spelling of Dr Norman's name, and the story\n    behind it, see @Kidd1988. The good doctor appears on page 6 of\n    @Joyce1922.\n\n[^3]: At least, they will be ignored if it is clear they are *errors*.\n    If there seems to be a method behind the misspellings, as in\n    *Ulysses* there frequently is, the matter is somewhat different, and\n    somewhat more difficult.\n\n    Tyler Doggett has argued that these cases are more similar to\n    paradigm cases of imaginative resistance than I take them to be.\n    Indeed, I would not have noticed the problems they raise without\n    reading his paper. It may be a shortcoming of my theory here that I\n    have to set questions about whether these sentences are puzzling to\n    one side and assume an ideal proof-reader.\n\n[^4]: Thanks here to George Wilson for reminding me that we haven't\n    shown anything stronger than that.\n\n[^5]: Arguably the relevant supervenience principle is even stronger\n    than that. To use some terminology of Stephen Yablo's, there's no\n    difference in moral facts without a difference in non-moral facts\n    between any two *counteractual* worlds, as well as between any two\n    *counterfactual* worlds. This might be connected to some claims I\n    will make below about the relationship between the normative and the\n    descriptive.\n\n[^6]: Determining whether this is true in *all* such stories would be an\n    enormous task, I fear, and somewhat pointless given the next\n    objection. If anyone wants to say all clearly impossible statements\n    in fiction are puzzling, I suspect the best strategy is to divide\n    and conquer. The most blatantly impossible claims are most naturally\n    fit for reinterpretation, and the other claims rest on an\n    essentialism that is arguably not proven. I won't try such a massive\n    defence of a false theory *here*.\n\n[^7]: There is a complication here in that such a sentence *might* be\n    evidence that the fictional work is not to be understood as this\n    kind of report, and instead understood as something like a recording\n    of the children's thoughts. I'll assume we're in a story where it is\n    clear that the sentences are not to be so interpreted.\n\n[^8]: Although it isn't obvious just which of the Thomistic properties\n    the death match lacks.\n\n[^9]: Do we make facts about the actual speaker's usage true in the\n    story? No. The character might have idiosyncratic reasons for not\n    using the word \"glory\", and for ignoring all others who use it.\n    That's consistent with the word meaning a nice knockdown argument.\n\n[^10]: This relates to another area in which my solution owes a debt to\n    Gendler's solution. Supposing can be coarse in a way that imagining\n    cannot. We can suppose that Jack sold a chair without supposing that\n    he sold an armchair or a dining chair or any particular kind of\n    chair at all. Gendler concludes that what we do in fiction, where we\n    try and imagine the fictional world, is very different to what we\n    do, say, in philosophical argumentation, where we often suppose that\n    things are different to the way they actually are. We can suppose,\n    for the sake of argument as it's put, that Kantian or Aristotelian\n    ethical theories are entirely correct, even if we have no idea how\n    to imagine either being correct. Thanks to Tyler Doggett for\n    pointing out the connection to Gendler here.\n\n[^11]: Thanks to Kendall Walton for pointing out this possibility.\n\n[^12]: \"That's all\" clauses play a distinct, but related, role in\n    [@Jackson1998 Ch. 1]. It's also crucial to my solution to the\n    alethic puzzle that there be a \"That's all\" clause in the story.\n    What's problematic about these cases is that the story (implicitly)\n    rules out there being the lower-level facts that would make the\n    expressed higher-level claims true.\n\n[^13]: Again, it is worth noting that I am not ruling out any violation\n    of *Virtue*, just easy violations of it. The point being made in the\n    text is that even a blanket ban on violations would not be a serious\n    restriction on authorial freedom.\n\n[^14]: For a while this would happen frequently on the TV series *The\n    West Wing*. President Bartlett would deliver a speech, and\n    afterwards his staffers would congratulate themselves on what a good\n    speech it was. The style of the congratulations was clearly intended\n    to convey the author's belief that the speech they themselves had\n    written was a good speech, not just the characters' beliefs to this\n    effect. When in fact it was a very bad speech, this became very\n    jarring. In later series they would often not show the speeches in\n    question and hence avoid this problem.\n",
