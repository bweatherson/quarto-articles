The attack focusses on\ntwo kinds of arguments. One is the argument from the behaviour of\noperators, as developed by David @Lewis1980b and David @Kaplan1977-KAPD.\nThe other kind of argument takes off from phenomena concerning speech\nreports and disagreements. Such arguments play central roles in\narguments by, among others, Andy @Egan2007-EGAEMR, Max\n@Kolbel2009-KLBTEF, Peter @Lasersohn2005, John MacFarlane [-@MacFarlane2003-MACFCA;\n-@MacFarlane2007-MACRAD], Mark @Richard2004-RICCAR and Tamina\n@Stephenson2007-STEJDE. These arguments also play a role in a paper that\nI co-authored with Andy Egan and John Hawthorne [@Egan2005-EGAEMI].\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Analysis_ 71: 133-143.\n\nPicture by [twodeadpoets](https://www.flickr.com/photos/39352077@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/afba651e-d8af-4369-b834-510d6159222c).\n</aside>\n\nAs the reader of *Relativism and Monadic Truth* can tell, John Hawthorne\nno longer much likes the arguments of that paper, nor its conclusions.\nAnd I think he's right to be sceptical of some of the arguments we\nadvanced. The objections that he and Herman Cappelen raise to arguments\nfor relativism from speech reports and from disagreement are, I think,\ntelling. But I don't think those are the best arguments for relativism.\n(For what it's worth, I don't think they're even the best arguments in\nthe paper we co-authored.) The primary purpose of this note will be say\na little about what some of these better arguments are. The core idea\nwill be that although there is some data that is *consistent* with\nnon-relativist theories, the best explanation of this data is that a\nkind of relativism is true. In short, we should be looking for\ninductive, not deductive, arguments for relativism. I'm going to fill in\nsome details of this argument, and say a little about how it seemed to\nslip out of the main storyline of *Relativism and Monadic Truth*.\n\nIn Chapter 2 of *Relativism and Monadic Truth*, Cappelen and Hawthorne\nattempt to develop diagnostics for when an utterance type $S$ has\ninvariant content. They note that some relativist arguments presuppose a\ndiagnostic based on speech reports. The idea behind the presupposed\ndiagnostic is that if we can invariably report an utterance of $S$ by\n$A$ by saying *A said that S*, then $S$ is semantically invariant. And\nthey note that this diagnostic isn't particularly reliable.\n\nWhat they aim to replace it with is a diagnostic based on agreement\nreports. Cappelen and Hawthorne are more careful on the details than\nI'll be, but the rough idea is easy enough to understand. The diagnostic\nsays that if whenever $A$ and $B$ utter $S$, we can report that by\nsaying *A and B agree that S*, and the basis for our saying this is that\nthey made those utterances, then $S$'s content is invariant. The idea\nbehind the test is that if there isn't a single proposition that $A$ and\n$B$ endorse, then it would be odd to say that they agree.\n\nI don't think the diagnostic is particularly plausible. The next couple\nof paragraphs won't come as much of a surprise to the authors of\n*Relativism and Monadic Truth*, since the ideas come from a talk Herman\nCappelen did at the Arché Summer School in July 2009. But they are\ncentral enough to the story I'm telling that they are worth including\nhere. The core problem for this agreement based diagnostic is that\nsometimes we can report parties as agreeing even though they don't agree\non the truth value of any proposition. So while (1) has a disambiguation\nwhere it is true only if something like (2) is true, it also has a\ndisambiguation where it is true as long as something like (3) is true.\n\nGiven that sentences like (1) could mean something like (3), there is\nlittle reason to think that agreement diagnostics will provide us clear\nevidence of sameness of content. Indeed, Cappelen and Hawthorne should\nhope that this diagnostic doesn't always work, because the diagnostic\nseems to entail relativism about epistemic modals. Imagine that a\ndetective and a psychic are both investigating a murder. They both\nconclude that their evidence entails that Tatort did it, and that their\nevidence is consistent with Tatort being dead. They are, however,\nignorant of each other's evidence, and indeed of the fact that the other\nis working on the investigation. Still, if each utters (4), it seems we\nare in a position to endorse (5).\n\nThis will be very hard to explain on a contextualist theory of epistemic\nmodals, if we accept the agreement diagnostic. That's because there's no\nproposition (other than the proposition that Tatort is guilty) that they\nagree about. I think this is *some* evidence in favour of relativism,\nbut if the contextualist wanted to argue that we should understand (4)\nthe same way we understand (1) (on its 'distributive' disambiguation),\nit would be hard to conclusively show they were wrong.\n\nIn any case, it is hard to see why we should expect there to be a\ndiagnostic of the kind Cappelen and Hawthorne are aiming for. Such\ndiagnostics are the exception, not the rule, in social sciences. There's\nno simple diagnostic for whether a particular state is democratic or\nnot. (Is modern-day Afghanistan a democracy? What about modern-day\nAlabama?) Nor is there a simple diagnostic for whether a particular rule\nis a law. (Are internal revenue regulations laws?) But political science\nand jurisprudence don't collapse in the absence of such diagnostics. Nor\nshould philosophical semantics collapse in the absence of a simple test\nfor context-sensitivity.\n\nIndeed, the situation is political science and in jurisprudence is in\none sense worse than it is in semantics. We can state, admittedly in\ntheory-laden terms, what it is for the content of a sentence type to be\ncontext-invariant or context-sensitive. It is much harder to state, even\nin theory-laden terms, what it is for a state to be democratic, or for a\nrule to be a law. The problem with thinking about the questions I asked\nin the previous paragraph isn't that there's some hidden piece of\nevidence we haven't yet uncovered. It's that the concepts do not have\nclear application conditions, and the hard cases fall between the clear\ninstances and non-instances of the relevant property. In semantics we\nhave, to a first approximation, a mere epistemic challenge.\n\nEven if the hunt for a diagnostic for context-sensitivity is bound to be\nfutile, as I think it is, that doesn't mean it is harmless. I think the\nstructure of Cappelen and Hawthorne's inquiry, which starts by looking\nfor a test and then goes on to apply it, pushes us towards the wrong\nkind of argument. The effect of this structure is that we end up looking\nfor *deductive* arguments for or against relativism, and the absence of\ndeductive arguments for relativism is taken to be a big problem for the\nrelativist. But we should have been looking for *inductive* arguments.\nThe best case for relativism, I think, will be a kind of inference to\nthe best explanation. For instance, a relativist might try to clean up\nthis argument.\n\n1.  Our best theory of mental content is that the contents of beliefs\n    and desires do not satisfy Simplicity.[^1]\n\n2.  The role of language is to express thoughts, so if the contents of\n    belief and desire do not satisfy Simplicity, the contents of\n    sentences and utterances probably don't either.\n\n3.  Simplicity is false as a theory of linguistic content.\n\nThis argument clearly isn't valid. That's by design; it's meant to be an\nabductive argument against Simplicity about linguistic content. And of\ncourse both premises are controversial. There's one argument for premise\n1 in @Lewis1979b, and another in @Perry1979-PERTPO. Both arguments are\ncontroversial. Indeed Cappelen and Hawthore spend some time (pages 50 to\n54) responding to the Lewisian arguments, though they spend less time on\nPerry's arguments.\n\nI'm not going to try to advance the debate here over whether premise 1\nis true or not. I suspect the solution will turn on much bigger issues\nthan can be covered in a note of this length. And that's because I think\nthe judgment about whether premise 1 is true will turn on quite global\nfeatures of our best theory of mental content. For instance, Daniel\n@Nolan2006-NOLSD argues that there are certain desires that we cannot\nunderstand on the modal Lewis offers. That doesn't *entail* that Lewis\nis wrong about the nature of belief, but it does make Lewis's theory of\nbelief look less attractive. From the other direction, many authors\nworking on the Sleeping Beauty problem, dating back to the problem's\nintroduction to the philosophical community in @Elga2000-ELGSBA, have\nfelt that the problem was best approached in Lewis's\nSimplicity-unfriendly framework. That doesn't entail Simplicity is\nwrong, but it is I think evidence against it. On the other hand, Robert\n@Stalnaker2008-STAOKO has recently argued that this is not the best\nframework for thinking about the Sleeping Beauty problem, and I've\nargued [@Weatherson-SoSB] that Stalnaker's approach lets us see things\nabout the Sleeping Beauty puzzle that are hidden on the standard,\nLewisian, approach. So if we're going to evaluate this kind of argument\nfor relativism, the issues are going to get far removed from familiar\ndisputes about distributions of words and phrases. That's not too\nsurprising. In general, the hard thing about abductive reasoning in\nphilosophy is that we have to start looking at all sorts of different\nkinds of evidence. But that's no reason to think that the most telling\narguments won't, at the end of the day, be abductive arguments.\n\nA quite different kind of argument comes from thinking about property\nascription and ignorance. It's a somewhat frequent occurrence that\nmodern science discovers that some of our thoughts seem to depend for\ntheir truth on more variables than we realised. So it isn't true that\ntwo accelerating objects simply have the same mass or different masses;\nrather, their relative mass might be different relative to different\ninertial frames. Or two colour patches might not be simply the same\ncolour or simply different colours. If the colours are metamers\n(relative to human vision) then they will be in a good sense the same\ncolour relative to human vision, and different colours relative to more\ndiscriminating detectors. Such cases raise challenges for the project of\ninterpreting a language.\n\nAssume that the community uses terms like 'mass'. Indeed, assume they\nare sophisticated enough to distinguish mass from weight, for they know\nthat weight is relative to a gravitational field, and gravitational\nfields vary in strength. But they are not sophisticated enough to know\nthat masses are relative to inertial frames. The members of this\ncommunity frequently go around saying things like \"Those two objects\nhave the same mass,\" referring to $a$ and $b$. Call that sentence $M$.\nWe assume that the members are in a particular inertial frame, call it\n$F$. Let's assume (just for a few paragraphs) that the propositions that\nsatisfy Simplicity are structured, and assume that we can represent the\nrelation *has the same mass as* by a somewhat unstructured relation\n$SameMass$. (In other words, ignore whatever internal structure\n$SameMass$ has, since it won't be relevant to this example.) Then it\nseems to me that there are three live options around.\n\n1.  By $M$, the speakers express the pseudo-proposition\n    $SameMass(a, b)$, and this pseudo-proposition is not capable of\n    being true or false, since $SameMass$ is a three-place relation\n    (between two objects and an inertial frame) and only two places are\n    specified.\n\n2.  By $M$, the speakers express the proposition $SameMass(a, b, F)$,\n    and this proposition is (capable of being) true.\n\n3.  By $M$, the speakers express the proposition $SameMass(a, b)$, and\n    this is (capable of being) true relative to $F$, although it might\n    be false relative to some other inertial frame $F^{\\prime}$.\n\nIf option 3 is correct, then it seems Simplicity fails.[^2] So if there\nare compelling arguments against options 1 and 2, and those are all the\noptions, then Simplicity is in trouble. And it seems the relativist\nmight make progress by pushing back against both of those options.\n\nThe simplest argument against option 1 is that it violates even a very\nweak form of the Principle of Charity. Obviously there are very many\ndifferent kinds of charity principles. For instance, there are three\ndifferent versions endorsed in @Davidson1970-DAVME, @Lewis1974c and\n[@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 Ch. 8]. But any kind of Charity will imply\nthat options 2 or 3 are preferable to option 1, since option 1 will\nimply that the subjects don't even have beliefs about the relative\nmasses of objects, whereas the other options will imply that their\nbeliefs may well be true, and rational, and even in some cases amount to\nknowledge. An alternative argument against option 1 is that the members\nof that community would have been right to take it as a Moorean fact\nthat some things have the same mass.[^3] So option 1 doesn't look overly\nplausible.\n\nOne argument against premise 2 is that it is impossible for the members\nof the community, given their powers of individuation, to make singular\nreference to such a thing as an inertial frame. If they don't know what\nan inertial frame is, then we might be sceptical of claims that they can\nrefer to it. (Note that the thought here isn't merely that some\nindividuals don't know what inertial frames are; the imagined case is\nthat even experts don't know about the kind of things that we would need\nto put into the propositions to give them simple truth values.) Another\nargument is that competent speakers of the language should be able to\nidentify the number of argument places in the properties they use.\n\nNeither of the arguments just offered is completely compelling, though I\nthink both are at least promising avenues for research. But both\narguments do look notably weaker if we drop the assumption that the\nrelevant propositions are structured. In an unstructured propositions\nframework, we perhaps don't need to worry about the members making\nsingular reference to things like inertial frames. We just need to have\nthe speakers pick out (in a perhaps imperfect way) the worlds in which\ntheir beliefs are true. And in an unstructured propositions framework it\nisn't clear that being unable to identify the number of arguments places\nin the properties they use is any more of a sign of linguistic\nincompetence than not knowing the individuals to which they refer. But\nit is a commonplace of semantic externalism that speakers can refer\nwithout knowing who it is they are referring to.\n\nThe arguments in the previous two paragraphs have been sketchy, to say\nthe least. But if they can be developed into compelling arguments, then\nit might turn out that the case against option 2 succeeds iff\npropositions are structured. In that case the argument for Simplicity\nwill turn on a very large question about the nature of propositions,\nnamely whether they are structured or not. Again, the take home lesson\nis that debates in this area are not susceptible to easy resolution.\n\nI'll end with a more narrowly linguistic abductive argument for\nrelativism and against Simplicity. I think you can find the core\ningredients of this argument in @Egan2005-EGAEMI, though it isn't as\nwell individuated as it might have been. The argument takes off from\nwhat looks like a somewhat misleading claim in Cappelen and Hawthorne's\nbook. The context is a discussion of autocentric and exocentric uses of\npredicates.[^4] The distinction between autocentric and exocentric uses\nis important for thinking about the way various predicates are used,\nthough it isn't easy to give a theory-neutral characterisation of it.\nAssuming contextualism, Cappelen and Hawthorne note that it is easy to\nexplain the distinction: \"a use of a taste predicate is autocentric iff\nits truth conditions are given by a completion that indexes the\npredicate to the subject\" and exocentric iff \"its truth conditions are\ngiven by a completion that indexes it to a person or group other than\nthe speaker, which may, however, include the speaker.\" (104) The core\nidea here is clear enough, I hope, though as they say it requires a\nslightly different gloss if we assume relativism.[^5]\n\nThe problem is what they go on to say about epistemic modals. In a\nfootnote they say,\n\n> [I]t is worth noting that there is a similar contrast between\n> autocentric and exocentric uses of epistemic modals. If I see Sally\n> hiding on a bus then I might in a suitable context say 'She is hiding\n> because I might be on the bus' even though I know perfectly well that\n> I am not on the bus. ('Must' is harder to use exocentrically, though\n> we shall not undertake to explain this here.) (104n7)\n\nThe parenthetical remark seems mistaken, or at least misleading, and for\nan important reason. It is true that it is very hard to use 'must'\nexocentrically in a sentence of the form *a must be F*. But that doesn't\nmean that it is hard to use 'must' exocentically. In fact it's very\neasy. Almost any sentence of the form *S believes that a must be F* will\nhave an exocentric use of 'must'. That's because almost any use of an\nepistemic modal in the scope of a propositional attitude report will be\n'bound' to the subject of that report. (I put 'bound' in scare quotes\nbecause although contextualists will think of this as literally a case\nof binding, non-contextualists may think something else is going on.)\nThis suggests an argument for relativism about epistemic modals, one\nthat seems to me to be quite a bit stronger than the arguments for\nrelativism discussed in *Relativism and Monadic Truth*.\n\n1.  Unembedded uses of epistemic modals are generally autocentric\n    (except in the context of explanations, like 'because I might be on\n    the bus').\n\n2.  Epistemic modals embedded in propositional attitude reports are\n    generally exocentric.\n\n3.  There is a good, simple relativist explanation of these two facts.\n\n4.  There is no good, simple explanation of these facts consistent with\n    Simplicity.\n\n5.  So, relativism is true, and Simplicity is false.\n\nNote that I'm not for a minute suggesting that there is no\nSimplicity-friendly explanation of the facts to be had; just that it\nwon't be a very good explanation. Nor am I suggesting that the phenomena\nobtain universally, rather than just in most cases. But they obtain\noften enough to need explanation, and the best explanation will be\nrelativist. And that, I think, is a reason to like relativism.\n\nThe simplest relativist explanation of premises 1 and 2 uses the idea,\nderived from @Lewis1979b, that contents are $\\lambda$-abstracts. So the\ncontent of *a must be F* is roughly $\\lambda x.(x$'s evidence entails\nthat $a$ is $F).$ A content $\\lambda x. \\phi(x)$ is true relative to a\nperson iff they are $\\phi$, and believed by a person iff they consider\nthemselves to be $\\phi$, under a distinctively first-personal mode of\npresentation. Then a typical utterance of *a must be F* will be\nautocentric because if the asserter thinks it is true, they must take\nthemselves to satisfy $\\lambda x.(x$'s evidence entails that $a$ is\n$F).$ So assuming they are speaking truly, the hearer can infer that the\nspeaker's evidence does indeed entail that $a$ is $F$. But a typical\nutterance of *S believes that a must be F* will be true just in case $S$\ntakes themselves to satisfy $\\lambda x.(x$'s evidence entails that $a$\nis $F)$, and hence will be true as long as $S$'s evidence, or at least\nwhat $S$ takes to be their evidence, entails that $a$ is $F$. There's no\nreference there to the speaker's evidence, so the use of 'must' is\nexocentric. There are, to be sure, many details of this explanation that\ncould use filling in, but what is clear is that there is a natural path\nfrom the view that contents are $\\lambda$-abstracts to the data to be\nexplained. And that explanation is inconsistent with Simplicity.\n\nIs there a good, simple Simplicity-friendly explanation of the data\naround? I suspect there is not. There are two obvious places to look for\na Simplicity-friendly explanation. We could look for an explanation that\nturns on the meaning of 'must', or we could look for an explanation in\nterms of salience. On closer inspection, neither avenue is particularly\npromising.\n\nIt does seem likely that there is an available explanation of premise 1\nin terms of the meaning of 'must'. The contextualist about pronouns has\nan easy explanation of why 'we' almost always picks out a group that\nincludes the speaker. The explanation is just that it is part of the\nmeaning of 'we' that it is a *first-personal* plural pronoun, so it is\npart of the meaning of 'we' that the group it picks out includes the\nspeaker. We could argue that something similar goes on for 'must'. So *a\nmust be F* means, roughly, that $x$'s evidence entails that $a$ is $F$,\nand it is part of the meaning of 'must' that $x$ either is the speaker,\nor is a group that includes the speaker. The problem with this\nexplanation is that it won't extend to premise 2. And that's because\nmeanings (in the relevant sense) don't change when we move into embedded\ncontexts. For example if Jones says \"Smith thinks that we will all get\nworse grades than she will get\", Jones isn't accusing Smith of having\nthe inconsistent belief that she will get lower grades than what she\ngets. Rather, the reference of 'we' is still a group that includes the\n*speaker*, not the subject of the propositional attitude report. On this\nmodel, you'd expect the truth condition of *S believes that a must be F*\nto be that $S$ believes that $x$'s evidence entails that $a$ is $F$,\nwhere $x$ is the speaker, or a group containing the speaker. But that's\ntypically not at all what it means. So this kind of explanation fails.\n\nThe problem for salience based explanations of premises 1 and 2 is that\nsalience is too fragile an explanatory base to explain the data. Let's\nsay that in general we think *a must be F* means, roughly, that $x$'s\nevidence entails that $a$ is $F$, and $x$ is generally the most salient\nknower in the context. Then we'd expect that it would be not too hard to\nread (6) in such a way that its truth condition is (6a) rather than\n(6b), and (7) in such a way that its truth condition is (7a) rather than\n(7b).\n\nAfter all, (6) and (7) make Jones's evidence *really salient*. That\nevidence settles who the killer is! But, it seems, that isn't salient\nenough to make (6a) or (7a) the preferred interpretation. That seems to\nbe bad news for a salience-based explanation of the way we interpret\nepistemic modals.\n\nLike all abductive arguments, this argument is far from conclusive. One\nway for a proponent of Simplicity to respond to it would be to come up\nwith a neater explanation of premises 1 and 2 in our abductive argument,\nwithout giving up Simplicity. Another way would be to argue that\nalthough there is no nice Simplicity-friendly explanation of the data,\nthe costs of relativism are so high that we should shun the relativist\nexplanation on independent grounds. I don't pretend to have ready\nresponses to either of these moves. All I want to stress is that these\nabductive arguments are generally stronger arguments for relativism than\nthe arguments that are, correctly, dismissed in *Relativism and Monadic\nTruth*. Those arguments try to take a quick path to relativism, claiming\nthat some data about reports, or disagreement, or syntax, entails\nrelativism. I doubt any such argument works, in part because of the\nobjections that Cappelen and Hawthorne raise. There is, as my title\nsays, no royal road to relativism. But I doubt there's a quick road away\nfrom relativism either. If the relativist can explain with ease patterns\nthat perplex the contextualist, we have good reason to believe that\nrelativism is in fact true.\n\n[^1]: *Simplicity* is Cappelen and Hawthorne's name for the conjunction\n    of theses they want to defend against the relativist. For our\n    purposes, Simplicity about mental content is the view that the\n    contents of beliefs and desires are propositions, and these\n    propositions are simply true or simply false, not merely true or\n    false relative to some or other parameter. Simplicity about\n    linguistic content is the view that these same propositions, the\n    ones that are simply true or false, are the contents of declarative\n    utterances.\n\n[^2]: I say 'seems' since I'm not sure exactly what it takes for there\n    to be a notion of truth *simpliciter*. The argument on page 96\n    against the conjunction of Simplicity, Eternalism and Temporalism\n    suggests that Cappelen and Hawthorne believe the following\n    principle: If $p$ is true in $C_1$, and false in $C_2$, and $C_1$\n    and $C_2$ both exist, then $p$ is not either simply true or simply\n    false. It's not obvious to me why $p$ couldn't, in $C_1$, be simply\n    true, but I take it Cappelen and Hawthorne are using 'simply' in\n    such a way as to exclude that. So option 3 is inconsistent with\n    Simplicity.\n\n[^3]: Compare the discussion of Moorean facts in [@Lewis1994a 489].\n\n[^4]: The terminology is from @Lasersohn2005.\n\n[^5]: As they also go on to note, things get very complicated in cases\n    where the truth conditions turn on the nature of an idealised\n    version of the speaker. An example of such a theory is the theory of\n    value in @Lewis1989b. One of the key points that Cappelen and\n    Hawthorne make, and I think it is a very good point against a lot of\n    claims for relativist theories concerning predicates of personal\n    taste, is that this kind of case is very common when it comes to\n    evaluative language.\n",
