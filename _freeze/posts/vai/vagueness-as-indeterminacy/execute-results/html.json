In recent years traditional wisdom has come under attack from several leading theorists. They are motivated by a common idea, that terms with borderline cases, but sharp boundaries around the borderline cases, are not vague. I argue for a return to tradition. Part of the argument is that the alternatives that have been proposed are themselves subject to intuitive counterexample. And part of the argument is that we need a theory of what vagueness is that applies to non-predicates. The traditional picture can be smoothly generalised to non-predicates if we identify vagueness generally with indeterminacy. Modern rivals to tradition do not admit of such smooth generalisation.\ndate: April 14 2018\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570386.003.0005\"\ncategories:\n  - logic\n  - language\n  - vagueness\ncitation_url: http://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570386.003.0005\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: clouds.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 4\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nRecently there has been a flurry of proposals on how to 'define'\nvagueness. These proposals are not meant to amount to *theories* of\nvagueness as, for instance, epistemic or supervaluational theories of\nvagueness are. That is, they are not meant to provide solutions to the\nraft of puzzles and paradoxes traditionally associated with vagueness.\nRather, they are meant to give us a sense of which terms in the language\nare vague, and to use Matti Eklund's phrase, in what their vagueness\nconsists. Doing this *might* be a prelude to a successful theory of\nvagueness, or it might just be an interesting classificatory question in\nits own right.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Cuts and Clouds: Vagueness, its Nature, & its Logic_, edited by Richard Dietz and Sebastiano Moruzzi, Oxford, 77-90.\n\nPicture via [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/58720).\n</aside>\n\nWhen this activity started, most notably with Patrick Greenough's \"A\nMinimal Theory of Vagueness\", I suspected that it would be a hopeless\nproject. Imagine, I thought, trying to give a definition of what\ncausation is that didn't amount to a theory of causation. That project\nseems hopeless, and I didn't think the prospects for a definition of\nvagueness were much better. I now think I was wrong, and we can learn a\nlot from thinking about which terms are vague, independent of our theory\nof vagueness. (As we'll get to below, Greenough's theory isn't marketed\nas a definition of vagueness, but rather a 'minimal theory' to which all\nparties can agree. But it has been taken, e.g. by Eklund and Nicholas\nSmith, to be providing a rival to genuine definitions of vagueness, and\nI'll follow Eklund and Smith in this respect.)\n\nThe point of this exercise is not to give an analysis of how the man on\nthe Clapham omnibus uses 'vague' and its cognates. As is widely\nrecognised, 'vague' is often used in ordinary language as a predicate\nthat applies to claims like *The Grand Canyon is between 2 and 2\ntrillion years old*, i.e. claims that are consistent with a wide range\nof possible worlds. That's not the sense of 'vague' which philosophers\nuse, nor the sense we are trying to define. But nor should we think we\nare just trying to analyse philosophical use of 'vague'. The\nphilosophers' usage may be our starting point, but if we find\nphilosophers have traditionally being ignoring theoretically important\ncommonalities, or blurring theoretically important distinction, our best\ndefinition may well amount to a revision of philosophical usage.\n\nThe game, I think, is one of setting goals for what a theory of\nvagueness should do. It is a legitimate objection to a theory of\nvagueness that it isn't comprehensive, that it doesn't cover the field.\nIf supervaluationism was only a theory of how vague words that started\nwith consonants behaved, for example, that would be a problem for\nsupervaluationism. But to press objections of this form we must have an\nantecedent answer to the question of which words are in the field, and\nhence should be covered. That's the good question which these\ndefinitions of vagueness address. Because I take this to be the\nimportant issue, I'm going to start this paper with a bunch of examples\nof apparently vague, and apparently non-vague, terms. We'll then look at\nwhich theories do the best job at systematising intuitions about these\ncases. I'll then argue that the best way to systematise our intuitions\nabout these cases while respecting theoretically important commonalities\nand distinctions is to take vagueness to be indeterminacy, while staying\nsilent for now on whether the indeterminacy is semantic or epistemic. In\ndoing so I'm returning to a traditional view of vagueness, one that is\ndiscussed in such classic works as Kit Fine's statement of\nsupervaluationism [@Fine1975a]. So I make no claim to originality in my\nconclusions here, though I hope at least *some* of the arguments are\noriginal.\n\n### Examples\n\nI'm going to introduce five classes of examples, which will serve as our\ndata in what follows. I'll give a fairly tendentious description of each\nclass to orient us before starting. Our five classes are (a) words that\nare indeterminate but not vague, (b) vague words that are not\npredicates, especially predicate modifiers, (c) vague predicates whose\nconditions of application are contentious, (d) vague predicates whose\napplication depends on discrete states of the world, and (e) vague\npredicates that do not determine boundaries.\n\n#### Indeterminacy without Vagueness\n\nMany philosophers, if asked, would say that vague words are those that\nhave borderline cases. As noted above, @Fine1975a takes exactly this\nview. My preferred view, that vagueness is indeterminacy, is a simple\ngeneralisation of this view to non-predicates. But it is a commonplace\nof the literature on definitions of vagueness that this won't do because\nof examples of indeterminacy without vagueness. Two examples are\ncommonly used. One of these is Sainsbury's example *child*\n[@Sainsbury1991]. By definition, the extension of *child* is the set of\npersons under sixteen years old, and its anti-extension is the set of\npersons eighteen years old or older. Sixteen and seventeen year olds are\nborderline cases. The intuition is that even though *child* has\nborderline cases it is not vague, because there are sharp boundaries to\nits borderline.\n\nA similar case arrives with *mass* as it is used by a Newtonian\nphysicist. (I'm grateful to Delia Graff Fara for pointing out the\nconnection here.) As @Field1973 showed, *mass* is indeterminate between\ntwo meanings, rest mass and proper mass. But it is intuitively *not*\nvague, because it is determinate that it means either rest mass or\nproper mass. These cases are well discussed in the existing literature,\nand I won't say much more about them here, save to note that one of the\nexamples that is usually taken to be very problematic for the vagueness\nas indeterminacy view, *child*, is not synonymous with any term in any\nnatural language. This is not a reason that it could not serve as a\ncounterexample, because a definition should cover all terms actual and\npossible.\n\n#### Non-Predicate Vagueness\n\nNot only predicates are vague. There is an extensive literature on vague\nsingular terms. Arguably many determiners are vague. And, as I'll stress\nhere, many predicate modifiers are vague.\n\nWe can make an intuitive distinction between vague and precise predicate\nmodifiers. Compare the following two (obviously artificial) predicate\nmodifiers. (I owe these examples to David Chalmers.) Where *F* is a\npredicate such that *Fa* is true iff for some variable *v*, *v*(*a*) \\>\n*x* and *v* has a natural zero value (e.g. like height and unlike\nutility) then we can define *doubly F* and *bigly F*. It is true that\n*a* is doubly *F* iff *v*(*a*) \\> 2*x* and *a* is bigly *F* iff\n*v*(*a*)/*x* is big. Now there's a good sense in which *doubly* is a\nprecise modifier, for the modification it makes to its attached\npredicate can be precisely defined, while *bigly* is a vague modifier.\nThat's the sense in which I mean some modifiers are vague and others are\nprecise. Note that even though *doubly* is precise it can be a\nconstituent of a vague predicate, such as *doubly tall*. That makes\nsense; just as a vague sentence need only contain one vague word, so\nneed a vague complex predicate need only contain one vague word.\n\nNow we might well ask whether natural language modifiers like *very* are\nvague or precise. I'm sad to say that I really don't have an answer to\nthat question, but I think it's an excellent question. To get a sense of\nhow hard it is, note one awkward feature of *very* -- it is most\ncomfortable attaching to words that are themselves vague. For instance\n(1a) is a sentence of English while (1b) is not.\n\nI don't know whether this is a universal feature of *very*. My best\nguess is that it is though in conversation some people have proposed\ninteresting putative counterexamples. (I'm grateful here to Daniel\nNolan.) But to avoid that complication, I'll introduce a new word\n*very*. This modifier is defined such that if *F* is vague then *very*\\*\n*F* means the same thing as *very F*, and if *F* is not vague then\n*very\\* F* is meaningless, like *very forty-seven years old*. It's an\nexcellent question whether *very* is vague, and I think it's a\nrequirement on a definition of vagueness that it allow this question to\nbe asked. As we'll see, this is sadly not true of most proposed\ndefinitions of vagueness on the market.\n\n#### Philosophically Interesting Vague Terms\n\nIt's morally obligatory that someone with my standard of living donate\n1% of their income to charity. It's not morally obligatory that someone\nwith my standard of living donate 100% of their income to charity. What\nis the largest *x* such that it's morally obligatory that someone with\nmy standard of living donate *x*% of their income to charity? (As a\nmoralistic cheapskate I'd rather like to know.) Arguably this is vague.\nBut perhaps only arguably. On some divine command theories it is\nprecise, because there's a fact about what God wants me to do, however\nhard this is to figure out. (It's even a knowable fact, since God knows\nit.) But on more standard secular moral theories this may indeed be\nvague.\n\nThere are two lessons to draw from this case. First, if two philosophers\ncan debate what the correct theory of morality is while one thinks it is\nvague and the other thinks is precise, as I think could happen in a\ndispute between a divine command theorist and a virtue ethicist, then\nknowing that a vague term is vague is not required for understanding the\nterm. (I assume here the divine command theorist is not so confused that\nshe's not really talking about *goodness*.)\n\nSecond, it is important to remember that for some vague terms competent\nusers of the term need not know in virtue of what they apply. Much of\nthe literature on vagueness focuses on words like *tall*, *thin* and\n*bald* where all competent users know which kinds of underlying facts\nare relevant to their application. But not all vague terms are like\nthat, as *good* illustrates. And this phenomena extends beyond the\nnormative, at least narrowly conceived. If you believe Tom @Wolfe2000\nthen among the youth of America *going out with* is vague and many do\nnot know exactly in virtue of what it applies. It's a familiar point in\nphilosophy of mind that competent users can disagree about what kinds of\nfeatures a thing must have to satisfy *is thinking*. And we can multiply\ninstances of this by considering any area of philosophy we like.\n\n#### Discrete Vague Terms\n\nAn academic with one child has few children for an academic. An academic\nwith five children does not have few children for an academic. (I'll\nomit the comparison class 'for an academic' from now on.) Where is the\nborderline between those with few children and those not with few\nchildren? (I don't ask out of personal interest this time.) This\nquestion, like the question of how much giving is morally obligatory,\nfeels vague. But note that we cannot generate a compelling Sorites\nparadox using *has few children*. Let's see how badly this Sorites\nargument fails.\n\nArguably premise e is plausible because as a material conditional it can\nbe seen to be true via the falsity of the antecedent. And at a pinch I\ncan see d as compellingly true for the same reason. But neither b nor c\nstrike me as at all compelling. If someone presents this argument as a\nSorites paradox, I simply deny that the paradox-mongerer can know these\npremises to be true, or that I have a reason to believe they are true.\nTo be sure, I don't know which premise is false. (If you think you know\nb to be false replace academics in the example with a more fertile\nprofessional group.) But just because I don't know where the argument\nfails doesn't mean it presents any kind of paradox. When I have no\nreason to accept two, maybe three, of the premises, the argument falls\nwell short of being paradoxical.\n\nA small note on terminology. Contemporary scientific theories imply that\nmany familiar vague predicates apply in virtue of facts about the world\nthat are, at some level, discrete. What I'm interested in under this\nheading are predicates where the differences between salient adjacent\ncases are easily observable, such as the difference between having two\nand three children.\n\n#### Vagueness without Boundaries\n\nThe letter of Patrick Greenough's proposal (to be discussed in section\nthree below) suggests that every vague term has only vague boundaries.\nThis is not true. The predicate *in one's early thirties* has a sharp\nboundary at the lower end and a precise boundary at the upper end. But\nit isn't too hard to amend his theory to allow for such cases, by saying\n(in effect) that a vague term is a term with at least one vague\nboundary. Nicholas Smith makes basically that move in his paper. But\nsuch a move won't work, because some vague predicates don't have\nboundaries. Indeed, some predicates can be vague even though they are\nsatisfied by every object in the domain. The examples here are a little\nmore complicated than in the rest of the paper, but I think they are\nimportant enough to warrant the complexity.\n\nFor the next several paragraphs the domain will be adult Australian\nwomen, and when I use *tall* I'll mean tall for an adult Australian\nwoman. I don't know enough facts to know where the boundaries are for\n*tall* in this context, but I'll stipulate that a woman shorter than\n170cm is determinately not tall, and a woman taller than 180cm is\ndeterminately tall. I claim here neither that I know where these\nboundaries are nor that I could know where they are. But I assume there\nare boundaries. I'm making these stipulations because it is easier to\nfollow the examples if I use 170 and 180 rather than variables like *y*\nand *z*. It will become obvious that the particular numbers won't\nmatter, as long as there's separation between them. It also doesn't\nmatter whether we use a semantic or epistemic account of determinacy\nhere. It will matter that we use classical logic at various points (e.g.\nin assuming there are boundaries), but I think that's perfectly\nreasonable in this context. (Here I follow the arguments in section 2 of\nGreenough's paper.)\n\nConsider the class of predicates defined by the following schema.\n\n> *tall~x~* =~df~ tall or shorter than *x* cm\n\nFor *x* \\< 170, *tall~x~* has all the same borderline cases as *tall*,\nand is presumably vague in anyone's book. For *x* \\> 180, *tall~x~*\ndeterminately applies to everyone in the domain, and for now we'll say\nthat makes it not vague. (Though note it need not determinately\ndeterminately apply to everyone in the domain, and we'll see below that\nmight be a reason to group it with the vague predicates.)\n\nWhen *x* is between 170 and 180, *tall~x~* has some very odd properties.\nThe borderline cases are those women whose height is between *x* and\n180cm. When *x* is close to 180, this might be a very small border.\nWhile we're assuming classical logic, we can assume that there is a\nvalue *y* such that women taller than *y* cm are tall and those shorter\nthan *y* cm are not tall. We need not here assume the value of *y* is\neither epistemically *or semantically* determinate. Consider a value of\n*x*, say 179, such that *x* \\> *y*. (Again it's not a necessary\nassumption that 179 \\> *y*, but it makes the example easier to\nunderstand if I use a particular number.) Now *tall*~179~ has some\ninteresting properties. It has borderline cases, those women between 179\nand 180cm tall. But it is satisfied by every woman, since every woman is\neither tall or shorter than 179cm. I think the existence of the\nborderline cases is sufficient to make *tall*~179~ vague. Note that\nthese cases are quite different to *child*, because at the upper\nboundary there is no sharp jump from borderline cases to clear cases --\nthe two blur together in just the way borderline cases and clear cases\nof *tall* blur together, so whatever reasons we had to worry about\n*child* being vague are not applicable here. Still the 'borderline\ncases' are mislabelled here for there is no border they fall on. Every\nwoman satisfies the predicate. So no definition of vagueness in terms of\nhaving a vague boundary, indeed of having a boundary at all, can work.\n\nOne might object here that a definition of vagueness is only meant to\napply to words not phrases. But just as we can worry about a possible\nword *child*, we can worry about a possible atomic word *gish* that\nmeans the same thing as *tall*~179~, so that move won't help here.\n\nWe now have enough data on the table. In the next section I argue that\ntreating vagueness as being indeterminacy provides a *satisfactory*\ntreatment of the data. In the third section I argue that none of the\nlive alternatives is so satisfactory. So I conclude, somewhat\ntentatively, that we should define vagueness as indeterminacy.\n\n### Vagueness as Indeterminacy\n\nBack when I was a supervaluationist, I thought that what it was for a\nterm to be vague was for it to refer to different things on different\nprecisifications. That won't do as a theory-neutral definition, for it\npresupposes supervaluationism, which is not only a theory but a false\ntheory. But we can capture the essential idea in slightly less loaded\nlanguage.\n\nI will have to make three possibly controversial assumptions. First, I\nassume a broadly Montagovian perspective, on which we can talk about the\nreferent of an arbitrary term. (See @Montague1970 [@Montague1973] for\nmore details.) That referent might be an object, or a truth value, or a\nfunction from objects to truth values, or a more complicated function\nbuilt out of these. Second, I assume we can sensibly use an expanded\nLagadonian language where objects can be names for themselves,\ntruth-values can be names for themselves, functions from objects to\ntruth-values can be names for themselves, and so on. (See Lewis 1986 for\nmore on Lagadonian languages.) Third, I assume there is no metaphysical\nvagueness, so each of these Lagadonian names is not vague.\n\nThose assumptions let us make a first pass at a definition of vagueness,\nas follows. A term *t* is vague iff there is some object, truth-value or\nfunction *l* which can serve as its own name such that the following\nsentence is neither determinately true nor determinately false.\n\nThat delivers the intuitively correct account in four of the five cases\nwe discuss above, all except the cases like *child*\\*. I'll say much\nmore about that case below. But it is in one respect slightly too\nliberal, and we need to make a small adjustment or two to fix this.\nConsider a predicate *F* that is defined over a vague domain, but which\nis determinately satisfied by every object in the domain. Intuitively it\nis a partial function, which maps every member of its domain to *true*.\nAnd assume for sake of argument that it is determinate that it maps\nevery member of the domain to *true*. (Say, for example, it means *is\nself-identical* when applied to a member of the domain.) Such a\npredicate is not, I think, vague. But since it is indeterminate which\npartial function it denotes, the above theory suggests it is vague. We\nneed to make a small adjustment. To state the corrected theory, we will\nstipulate that *every* term denotes a function. What were previously\nthought of as terms denoting constants will be treated as terms denoting\nconstant functions. So instead of a name like *Scott Soames* denoting\nScott Soames, we'll take it to denote the function that takes anything\nwhatsoever as input, and returning Scott Soames as output. Given that,\nour second take at a definition of vagueness is as follows.\n\n> *t* is vague iff ${\\exists}$*x*, *y*~1~, *y*~2~ such that *y*~1~\n> ${\\neq}$ *y*~2~ and it is indeterminate whether ${\\exists}$*l* such\n> that *t* denotes *l* and *l*(*x*) = *y*~1~, and it is indeterminate\n> whether ${\\exists}$*l* such that *t* denotes *l* and *l*(*x*) =\n> *y*~2~.\n\nTo get a sense of the definition, it helps to translate it back into\nsupervaluational talk, and look at the special case where *t* is a\npredicate. Then the definition comes to the claim that there is some\nobject that is in the extension of *t* on one precisification, and in\nthe anti-extension of *t* on another, which seems like what was\nintended.\n\nArguably even that is not enough of a correction. (I'm indebted in the\nfollowing three paragraphs to Mark Johnston.) Frequently there are\ndebates in semantics over the appropriate *type* of various terms.[^1]\nFor instance, a straightforward account would say that in *She ran\nyesterday*, *yesterday* modifies the intransitive verb *run*, so it\ndenotes a function of type $\\langle$$\\langle$e,t$\\rangle$,\n$\\langle$e,t$\\rangle$$\\rangle$. But on a Davidsonian semantics,\n*yesterday* denotes a property of the running event being discussed, so\nits type is simply $\\langle$e,t$\\rangle$. Now it is at least a\nphilosophical possibility that there should be no fact of the matter\nwhich of these theories is correct.\n\nThere are two things we might say about such a possibility. On the one\nhand, it doesn't at all seem right that a word should count as vague\nbecause it is indeterminate what its type should be. That suggests the\nabove definition needs modification. On the other hand, the above\ndefinition doesn't imply *t* is vague whenever there are two distinct\nfunctions that could be the denotation of *t*; it must also be the case\nthat these functions have overlapping domains. The most natural cases of\nsyntactic indeterminacy are cases where the two possible denotations are\nfunctions of quite different types. That suggests the above definition\nneeds no modification.\n\nI think the case for modification is a little stronger. That's partially\nbecause the possibility of type-shifting suggests there's a possibility,\nperhaps a distant one but a possibility, that the second suggestion\ncould fail. And partially because even if there are no uncontroversial\ncases of syntactic indeterminacy that will mistakenly be treated as\ncases of vagueness by this theory, the mere possibility of classifying a\ncase of syntactic indeterminacy as a case of vagueness should be enough\nto warrant concern. And there is a way to modify the definition that\ndoes not look like it will lead to mistakenly ruling out any cases of\nvagueness that should be ruled in, as follows.\n\n> *t* is vague iff ${\\exists}$*x*, *y*~1~, *y*~2~ such that *y*~1~\n> ${\\neq}$ *y*~2~ and *y*~1~ is of the same type as *y*~2~, and it is\n> indeterminate whether ${\\exists}$*l* such that *t* denotes *l* and\n> *l*(*x*) = *y*~1~, and it is indeterminate whether ${\\exists}$*l* such\n> that *t* denotes *l* and *l*(*x*) = *y*~2~.\n\nThat implies that if *yesterday* is indeterminate merely because it is\nindeterminate what type of function it denotes, it won't count as vague,\nand that's all to the good. So this is our final definition of\nvagueness.\n\nStill there's a problem with *child*. Many people have thought that it\nshould not be considered vague for one reason or another. Sometimes this\nis just asserted as a raw intuition, as in Smith and Eklund. There's no\narguing with an intuition, so I won't try arguing with it. Rather I'll\njust repeat a point I made at the start. We aren't here in the business\nsimply of summarising ordinary or philosophical intuitions. Rather we\nare looking for a definition that captures all the cases that fall into\nthe most theoretically important categories. And intuitions about\ntheoretical importance are less impressive than demonstrations of\ntheoretical importance.\n\nPatrick @Greenough2003 suggests that the problem with terms like *child*\nis that they aren't vague, but rather that they are simply undefined for\nthe alleged borderline cases. If that's true, and perhaps for some of\nthe examples people had in mind in this area it is, then our definition\nagrees that they are not vague. For a term that carves a precise\ndivision out of part of the domain, and then stays silent, is precise\nnot vague on my account.\n\nGreenough also suggests that the problem with *child* is that it is not\nhigher-order vague.[^2] But as he says this can hardly be the entirety\nof the problem. For it does not seem to be *definitional* that the vague\nterms are also higher-order vague. True, there is a theoretically\nimportant category of terms that are vague and higher-order vague. But\nit is not a category that we cannot represent. A term *t* is in this\ncategory just in case *t* is vague, and *definitely t* is vague, and\n*definitely definitely t* is vague, and so on. So we can capture that\ncategory, even if we don't call only members of that category the vague\nterms. And this doesn't seem to diminish the theoretical importance of\nthe category of terms I called vague.\n\nIt might be thought that what is wrong with *child* is that it cannot be\nused to generate a Sorites argument. If you think that's what is\ncentrally important to vague terms, then there's a theoretical reason to\nseparate *child* from the genuinely vague. But we should have seen\nenough by now to show that that can't be right. It's hard to know what\nit is for a predicate modifier to be Sorites-susceptible, and our last\ntwo example predicates, *has few children* and *tall*~179~ cannot be\nused to set up Sorites arguments. So that *child* does not generate a\nSorites paradox is no reason to classify it outside the vague.\n\nSo I take it there is no compelling reason to classify *child* and\nsimilar terms as precise rather than vague. Admittedly there is an\nintuition that they are not vague, and perhaps that should be respected.\nBut if the cost of respecting that intuition is that we misclassify\nseveral other terms, we should reject the intuition. That's what I'll\nargue in the next section.\n\n### Rival Definitions\n\nI just mentioned the idea that a vague predicate could be defined as one\nthat is susceptible to a Sorites argument. This account is sometimes\nattributed to Delia Graff @Fara2000, but it seems quite a widespread\nview. For instance, Terence @Horgan1995 says that it is distinctive of\nvague predicates that they can be used to generate *inconsistency*\nbecause the Sorites premises attaching to them are *true*. As I\nmentioned, such views are vulnerable to a wide variety of\ncounterexamples. Many of these counterexamples also apply to rival\ndefinitions of vagueness.\n\nMatti @Eklund2005 develops a similar kind of definition. He starts with\nCrispin Wright's [-@Wright1975] famous definition of what it is for a\npredicate *F* to be *tolerant*.\n\n> Whereas large enough differences in *F*'s parameter of application\n> sometimes matter to the justice with which it is applied, some small\n> enough difference never thus matters.\n\nEklund's position then is that *F* is vague iff it is part of semantic\ncompetence with respect to *F* to be disposed to accept that *F* is\ntolerant. Eklund agrees that it is inconsistent to assert that *F* is\nindeed tolerant. But as he has argued extensively elsewhere, the falsity\nof the tolerance principle is compatible with it being part of\ncompetence that one is disposed to accept it. (A view in the same family\nis put forward in @Sorensen2001.) I have no wish to dispute this part of\nEklund's theory. Indeed that meaning principles can be false, even\ninconsistent, it seems to have been a fairly fruitful idea in a variety\nof areas of Eklund's philosophy. But I don't think it helps with vague\nterms.\n\nThree of the problems with this have already been given. It is not clear\nwhat a parameter of application for a non-predicate like *very* even is,\nso it isn't clear what it means to say that *very* is tolerant. It\nsurely is not required of competent users of *few children* that they\nare disposed to accept the premises in our earlier Sorites argument. And\nfor some vague predicates, like *tall*~179~, the tolerance principle is\nnot plausible to a competent speaker because it is not plausible that a\n\"large enough\" difference in the parameter of application (presumably\nheight) matters. These problems all seem to carry over from the problems\nassociated with Sorites based definitions.\n\nI suspect, though I'm less certain here, that the philosophically\ninteresting cases also pose a problem for Eklund's view. When we look at\nphilosophically interesting cases, like *being good*, there are two\ndistinct ways to read Eklund's claim that competent speakers are\ndisposed to accept the tolerance principle. These are the wide scope and\nthe narrow scope reading. To see the ambiguity, let's write out Eklund's\nprinciple in full.\n\n> Competent speakers are disposed to accept that whereas large enough\n> differences in *F*'s parameter of application sometimes matter to the\n> justice with which it is applied, some small enough difference never\n> thus matters.\n\nHere's the wide scope reading of this.\n\n> *F*'s parameter of application is such that whereas competent speakers\n> are disposed to accept that large enough differences in it sometimes\n> matter to the justice with which *F* is applied, some small enough\n> difference never thus matters.\n\nAnd here is the narrow scope reading, with a phrase added for emphasis.\n\n> Competent speakers are disposed to accept that whereas large enough\n> differences in *F*'s parameter of application, *whatever it is*,\n> sometimes matter to the justice with which it is applied, some small\n> enough difference never thus matters.\n\nTo see the difference between the two cases, assume for the sake of\nargument that a competent speaker thinks that to be good is to do\nactions whose consequences have a high enough utility, whereas in\nreality to be good is to obey enough of God's commands. In each case\n*being good* is vague, because we are using satisficing versions of\nconsequentialism and divine command theory. So the parameter of\napplication for *being good* is the number of God's commands you obey.\nThe competent speaker will not accept the wide scope version of\ntolerance with respect to *being good*, because they don't think that\nlarge differences with respect to how many of God's commands you obey\nmatter to the justice with which *being good* is applied. Such cases can\nbe multiplied endlessly to show that the wide scope version of Eklund's\nprinciple cannot generally be true, because it makes it the case that\ncompetent speakers have correct views on contentious philosophical\nmatters the resolution of which goes beyond semantic competence. For\nthese reasons Eklund has said (personal communication) that he intends\nthe narrow scope version.\n\nBut the narrow scope version also faces some difficulties. The most\ndirect problem is that one can be a competent user of a term like *food*\nor *dangerous* or *beautiful* without having any thoughts about\nparameters of application. I suspect I was a competent user of these\nterms before I even had the concept of a parameter of application. Even\nbracketing this concern, there is a worry that competence requires\nknowing of a term whether it is vague or not. But this seems to be a\nmistake. It is not a requirement of competence with moral terms like\n*good* that one know whether they are maximising or satisficing terms.\nTom Wolfe and the students he observed while writing *I Am Charlotte\nSimmons* seemed to disagree about whether *going out with* is vague, but\nthey were both competent users, they simply disagreed on something like\na normative question. (See @Wolfe2000 for more on his take on matters.)\nAnd it seems that two users of language could disagree over whether *is\nthinking* is vague without disagreeing over whether either is a\ncompetent semanticist. They may well disagree over whether either is a\ncompetent philosopher of mind, but such disagreements are neither here\nnor there with respect to our present purposes. So I don't think that\neither disambiguation of Eklund's principle can properly account for\nvagueness in philosophically interesting terms.\n\nNicholas Smith argues for a definition of vagueness that uses some\nheavier duty assumptions about the foundations of semantics. In\nparticular, he sets out the following definition,\n\nCloseness\n\n:   If *a* and *b* are very similar in *F*-relevant respects, then\n    '*Fa*' and '*Fb*' are very similar in respect of truth.\n\nand goes on to say that vague predicates are those that satisfy\nnon-vacuously satisfy Closeness over some part of their domain. For this\nto work there must be, as Smith acknowledges, both degrees of truth and\nsomething like a distance metric defined on them. (These are separate\nassumptions; in the theory of Weatherson 2005 the first is true but not\nthe second.) I won't question those assumptions, but rather focus on the\nproblems the definition has even granting the assumptions.\n\nAs with the two definitions considered so far, it is hard to see how\nthis could possibly be generalised to cover vagueness in non-predicates.\nIt's true (given our assumptions) that if *a* and *b* are similar in\n*very tall*-relevant respects, then '*a* is very tall' and '*b* is very\ntall' will be similar in respect of truth. But that doesn't show *very*\nis vague, for the same condition is satisfied when we replace *very*\nwith the precise modifier *doubly*. This isn't an argument that Smith's\ndefinition *couldn't* be extended to cover modifiers, but a claim that\nit is hard to see how this will work.\n\nThe definition also has trouble with *tall*~179~ for this satisfies\nCloseness vacuously. Though to be fair given the logical assumptions\nSmith makes, it is possible that no predicate with the properties I've\nassociated with *tall*~179~ can be defined.\n\nMore seriously, there is a problem with predicates like *has few\nchildren*. It just isn't true that \"An academic with two children has\nfew children\" is close in truth value to \"An academic with one child has\nfew children\". In general Smith's theory has trouble with, i.e. rules\nout by definition, vague terms where the underlying 'relevant respects'\nare highly discrete. Note that the problem here extends to some\npredicates where the underlying facts are continuous. Consider the\npredicate *is very late for the meeting*. At least where I come from, a\nperson who is roughly ten minutes late is a borderline case of this\npredicate. But which side of ten minutes late they are matters. (In what\nfollows I make some wild guesses about how numerical degrees of truth,\nwhich aren't part of my preferred theory, should operate. But I think\nthe guesses are defensible given the empirical data.) If Alice is nine\nand three-quarters minutes late, and Bob is ten and a quarter minutes\nlate, then the degree of truth of \"Alice is very late\" will be much\nsmaller than the degree of truth of \"Bob is very late\". The later you\nare the truer \"you are very late\" gets, but crossing conventionally\nsalient barriers like the ten minutes barrier matter much more to the\ndegree of truth than crossing other barriers like the nine minutes\nthirty-three seconds barrier. Smith (in conversation) has suggested that\nhe's prepared to accept that *is very late for the meeting* is only\npartially vague if the truth-values 'jump' at the ten minute mark as I'm\nsuggesting. But this seems improper, for this is as clear a case of a\nvague predicate as we have. Still, it's worth remembering as always that\nevery definition has its costs, and this may be a cost one chooses to\nlive with. Personally I think it is excessive.\n\nPatrick Greenough did not put forward his theory as a *definition* of\nvagueness, but rather as a *minimal theory* to which all partisans could\nagree. Like Eklund, Greenough plays off Crispin Wright's idea of\ntolerance. Roughly, a vague predicate is one that is epistemically\ntolerant -- it's one where you can't know that a small difference makes\na difference. Here's a less rough statement of it, though note this is\nheavily paraphrased.\n\nLet ${\\tau}$ be a variable that ranges over truth states (e.g. true,\ndeterminately true, not determinately determinately not determinately\ntrue, etc.) *v* a function from objects to real numbers such that\nwhether *x* is *F* depends only on the value of *v*(*x*) (i.e. *v* is\n*F*'s parameter of application) and *c* a suitably small number. Then\n*F* is vague iff the following claim non-vacuously holds.\n\n> ${\\forall}{\\tau}{\\forall}{\\alpha}{\\forall}{\\beta}{\\forall}$*a*${\\forall}$*b*,\n> if *v*(${\\alpha}$) - *v*(${\\beta}$) \\< *c* and *a* names ${\\alpha}$\n> and *b* names ${\\beta}$ and it is knowable that *Fa* is ${\\tau}$ then\n> it is not knowable that *Fb* is not ${\\tau}$.\n\nLess formally, we can't know where any boundary at any order of\ndefiniteness for *F* lies. (It isn't clear in Greenough's presentation\nexactly what the non-vacuous condition comes to. He only explicitly says\nthat for the special case where ${\\tau}$ is *is true* there must be an\n*a* and a *b* such it is knowable that *Fa* is ${\\tau}$ and *Fb* is not\n${\\tau}$, but maybe that should be extended to all ${\\tau}$.) Because of\ncases like *in one's early thirties* this cannot do as a general\ndefinition, but it is easy enough to repair it by restricting the\nquantifier attaching to *a* and *b* to a range over which *F* has only\nvague boundaries. Doing this amounts to weakening Greenough's claim from\nthe view that vague terms have only vague boundaries to the view that\nthey have some vague boundaries, which seems plausible. But still there\nare problems.\n\nMost obviously, *tall*~179~ does not non-vacuously satisfy the tolerance\nrequirement. And like all the tolerance-based theories it is far from\nclear how it should be extended to vagueness in non-predicates. On the\nother hand, Greenough's theory might well handle the discrete cases like\n*has few children*. I say *might* rather than *does* because it is\nrather hard to work out how the higher-orders of vagueness work for such\nterms. I'll simply note that there are some plausible enough epistemic\nmodels on which *has few children* satisfies his requirement.\n\nThere is a problem which is distinctive to Greenough's view of his\ntheory as a minimal theory. As Smith notes, Greenough makes it a\nrequirement that vague boundaries are unknown. But this is controverted\nin some mainstream theories, for example the version of\nsupervaluationism in @Dorr2003. Since Dorr's theory should not be ruled\nout by a minimal theory or a definition, this is a weakness in\nGreenough's theory.\n\nThe more philosophically interesting problems concern, appropriately\nenough, the philosophically interesting terms. Greenough has a proof\nthat his definition is equivalent to a definition in terms of borderline\ncases. The proof has several assumptions, one of which being that we\nknow what the parameter of application of a vague term is. More\nprecisely, he assumes that we know everyone older than an old person is\nold, which is unproblematic, but he also assumes that the proof\ngeneralises to all vague cases, and this amounts to the assumption that\nwe know parameters of application. As we've seen, this isn't true of\nphilosophically interesting vague terms. This leaves open the\npossibility that Greenough's theory, unlike Smith's and Eklund's\ntheories, overgenerates. The following is probably not a live\npossibility in any interesting sense, but it isn't I think the kind of\nthing a definition (or minimal theory) should rule out by definition.\n\nIt is possible that a kind of mysterianism about ethics is true, and we\ncannot know whether *good* is vague or precise. For a concrete example,\nlet's assume it is knowable that some kind of divine command theory is\ntrue, but it is unknowable whether to be good one must obey all of God's\ncommands or merely enough of them, where it is vague what counts as\nenough of them. In fact morality requires obeying all God's commands,\nbut this is not knowable -- for all we know the satisficing version is\nthe true moral theory. If this is the case then *good* will be\nepistemically tolerant, for we cannot know that a small difference in\nhow many of God's commands you obey makes a difference to whether you\nare good, or determinately good etc. But in fact *good* is precise, for\nit precisely means obeying all of God's commands. Earlier I objected to\nEklund's theory because semantic competence does not require knowing\nparameters of application, especially as such. This is the converse\nobjection -- I claim that a term's being precise does not imply that we\nknow, or even *could know*, that it applies in virtue of a precise\ncondition. All that matters is that it *does* apply in virtue of a\nprecise condition.\n\nIt's a constant danger in philosophy that one infer from the falsity of\nall extant rivals that one's preferred theory is correct. I certainly\ndon't want to argue that because Eklund's, Smith's and Greenough's\ndefinitions are incorrect that the traditionalist definition I have\noffered must be right. But we can make that conclusion more plausible by\nnoting how widely the arguments levelled here generalise. The\nphilosophically interesting cases seem to tell against *any* definition\nof vagueness in terms of semantic competence, for they show that\ncompetent users can have exactly the same attitude towards vague terms\nas they have towards precise terms. And our moral example suggests that\nany definition in terms of epistemic properties will be in trouble for\nit might not be knowable whether a particular term is vague or precise.\nFinally, the cases of vague predicate modifiers raise difficulties for\nany attempt to define the vagueness of a term in terms of properties of\nsentences in which it is used rather than mentioned. For it seems that\nas long as *very* attaches only to vague predicates, then whether\n*very*\\* is vague or precise will make no salient differences to the\nsentences in which it appears. So we have to look at sentences in which\nthe allegedly vague term is mentioned. And while I don't have a\ndefinitive argument here, I think looking at the range of cases we want\nto cover, and in particular at the range of cases where tolerance-type\nprinciples fail to be non-vacuously satisfied, our best option for\ncompleting these sentences is to look whether the term has a determinate\nor indeterminate denotation. We can then pass the questions of what\ndeterminacy consists in, and in particular the question of whether it is\nan epistemic or semantic feature, to the theorist of vagueness.\n\n[^1]: In what follows I'll refer to functions of type $\\langle$X,\n    Y$\\rangle$. These are functions from things of type X to things of\n    type Y, where the basic types are entities, represented by e, and\n    truth values, represented by t. So a function of type $\\langle e,\n    t \\rangle$ is a function from objects to truth values, or,\n    equivalently, the characteristic function of a set. A function of\n    type $\\langle$$\\langle$e, t$\\rangle$, $\\langle$e,\n    t$\\rangle$$\\rangle$ is a function from characteristic functions of\n    sets to characteristic functions of sets. This is plausibly the\n    semantic value of a predicate modifier like *very*.\n\n[^2]: When I say a term is higher-order vague, I mean that it is subject\n    to higher-order vagueness, not that it is vague whether the term is\n    vague.\n",
