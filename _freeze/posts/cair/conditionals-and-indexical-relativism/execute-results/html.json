The core of the view is that which proposition is (semantically) expressed by an utterance of a conditional is a function of (among other things) the speaker’s context and the assessor’s context. This implies a kind of relativism, namely that a single utterance may be correctly assessed as true by one assessor and false by another.\ndate: December 29 2008\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1007/s11229-007-9283-5\"\ncategories:\n  - language\n  - conditionals\n  - relativism\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-007-9283-5\njournal:\n    title: \"Synthese\"\n    publisher: \"Springer\"\nvolume: 166\nnumber: 2\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: leith.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nThis paper is about a class of conditionals that Anthony Gillies (ms)\nhas dubbed 'open indicatives', that is, indicative conditionals \"whose\nantecedents are consistent with our picture of the world\" (1). I believe\nthat what I say here can eventually be extended to all indicative\nconditionals, but indicatives that aren't open raise special problems,\nso I'll set them aside for today. In @Weatherson2001-WEAIAS I argued for\nan epistemic treatment of open indicatives, and implemented this in a\ncontextualist semantics. In this paper I want to give another argument\nfor the epistemic approach, but retract the contextualism. Instead I'll\nput forward a relativist semantics for open indicatives. The kind of\nrelativism I'll defend is what I'll dub 'indexical relativism'.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Synthese_ 166: 333-357.\n\nPicture by [angus mcdiarmid](https://www.flickr.com/photos/81004917@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/a242822f-1f46-464b-9e50-929c4f5cdcff).\n</aside>\n\nI've changed my mind since @Weatherson2001-WEAIAS largely because of\ndevelopments since I wrote that paper. There have been six primary\ninfluences on this paper, listed here in order that they become relevant\nto the paper.\n\n1.  The arguments that Jason Stanley (along with co-authors) puts\n    forward in his [-@Stanley2007-STALIC] for the view that all effects\n    of context on semantic content are syntactically triggered, and in\n    particular involve context setting the value for a tacit or overt\n    variable.\n\n2.  John MacFarlane's defences, starting with @MacFarlane2003-MACFCA-2\n    of semantic relativism.\n\n3.  John MacFarlane's recent work, including @MacFarlane2009-MACNC at\n    distinguishing the view that propositional truth can vary between\n    different contexts in the same world, and the view that the truth of\n    an utterance can be assessor-sensitive.\n\n4.  Tamina Stephenson's [-@Stephenson2007] arguments in favour of a\n    variable PRO~J~ whose value is set by assessors.\n\n5.  Philippe Schlenker's [-@Schlenker2003] idea, modelled on some\n    examples from Barbara @Partee1989 that plural variables can be\n    'partially bound'.\n\n6.  Anthony Gillies's [-@Gillies2009-GILOTF] suggestions for how to\n    explain the acceptability of the 'import-export' schema in an\n    epistemic theory of indicative conditionals.\n\nI think it is noteworthy, in light of the claims one sometimes hears\nabout philosophy not making progress, that most of the building blocks\nof the theory defended here weren't even clearly conceptualised at the\ntime I wrote the earlier paper.\n\nThis paper is in seven sections. The paper starts with an argument in\nfavour of an epistemic treatment of open indicatives, namely that only\nthe epistemic theory can explain our judgments about inferences\ninvolving open indicatives. The argument isn't completely original,\nindeed much of what I'll say here can be found in @Stalnaker1975-STAIC,\nbut I don't think the scope of this argument has been sufficiently\nappreciated. There are a large family of epistemic theories, and in\nsection two I'll set out some of the choice points that an epistemic\ntheorist faces. I'll also introduce a fairly simple epistemic theory,\nnot the one I favour actually, that I'll focus on in what follows. My\npreferred theory has several more bells and whistles, but I don't think\nthose are relevant to the issues about relativism and indexicalism that\nI'll focus on here, and including them would just complicate the\ndiscussion needlessly.\n\nIn section three I look at four ways a theory could say that the truth\nof an utterance type is sensitive to context.[^1] The four ways are\ngenerate by the ways the theory answers two questions. First, is the\ntruth of the utterance type sensitive to facts about the context of\nutterance, as contextualists say, or to facts about the context of\nevaluation, as relativists say? Second, does the utterance type express\ndifferent propositions in different contexts, as indexicalists say, or\ndoes it express a proposition that takes different truth values in\ndifferent contexts, as non-indexicalists say? In using the term\n'indexicalist', I'm implicitly assuming the theory, most associated with\nJason @Stanley2007-STALIC , that the way an utterance type can express\ndifferent propositions in different contexts is that it has a variable\nin its semantic structure, and different contexts assign different\nvalues to this variable.\n\nThree of the four options generated by the two questions, indexical\ncontextualism, non-indexical relativism, and non-indexical\ncontextualism, have received some coverage in the literature. The fourth\noption, indexical relativism, has not been as widely discussed. In\nsection four I say a little about its motivations, including its\nconnection to recent work by Tamina Stephenson. The variable in the\nsemantics for open indicatives is a plural variable; roughly it takes as\nvalues all those propositions that are known by the salient people in\nthe context. In section five I note some odd properties about bound\nplural pronouns that will become relevant to the story that follows. The\nshort version is that some plural pronouns can have their values set\npartially by antecedent linguistic material, and partially by context.\nSo if a pronoun *v* refers to the Xs, it might be that *a* is one of the\nXs because *v* is bound to a term that denotes *a*, and *b* is one of\nthe Xs because *b* is contextually salient in the right kind of way to\nbe one of the things that *v* denotes.\n\nIn section six I put forward the arguments against contextualism, and in\nparticular against indexical contextualism. I start with some arguments\nfrom 'faultless disagreement', and go through four reasons why these\nmight not be too strong. I then discuss some arguments from facts about\nwhen two people have said the same thing, or have said different things.\nThese arguments tell against simple forms of indexical contextualism,\nbut not against more sophisticated versions. But I conclude with a\nsomewhat simpler argument, an argument from what I'll call easy\nagreement, that does seem to undermine indexical contextualism.\n\nFinally in section seven I'll argue against non-indexical theories of\nopen indicatives. The primary argument will be that the indexicalist has\na good explanation of what's going on in McGee's 'counterexamples to\nmodus ponens', an explanation borrowed from some recent work by Anthony\nGillies, but the non-indexicalist does not. The indexicalist's\nexplanation is that these arguments contain fallacies of equivocation;\non the non-indexicalist position, it is hard to see how they equivocate.\nThe upshot of the final two sections is that indexical relativism is\ncorrect.\n\n### Inferences Involving Conditionals\n\nI'm going to start by offering an argument for an epistemic treatment of\nconditionals. The argument isn't particularly new, I'm basically just\noffering an extension of the argument in @Stalnaker1975-STAIC, but I\ndon't think the force of it has been fully appreciated. The argument\nstarts with the observation that any instance of any of the following\ninference schema seems acceptable when the conclusion is an open\nindicative.\n\n1.  *Not A or B*; so, *If A then B*\n\n2.  *All Fs are Gs*; so, *If Fa then Ga*\n\n3.  *f*(*x*) = *f*(*y*); so *If f*(*a*) = *c* *then f*(*b*) = *c*\n\nHere are some instances of each of these inferences.\n\n4.  Either Jack won't come to the party or Jill will; so if Jack comes\n    to the party, so will Jill.\n\n5.  All of Kim's students failed; so if Alex was one of Kim's students,\n    then Alex failed.\n\n6.  Peter's mother is Paul's mother; so if Peter's mother is Mary,\n    Paul's mother is Mary.\n\nQuite a lot has been written about (1)/(4) and I don't propose to\nadd to it. It is arguable that part of the explanation for its\nattractiveness comes from pragmatic properties of disjunctions, and if\nthat's right it would complicate the story I want to tell here. Instead\nI'll focus on the other two inferences.\n\nJonathan Ichikawa pointed out to me that (3) is not particularly\ncompelling in cases where it is common ground in the conversation that\n*f*(*a*) is not *c*. For instance, it is at least odd to say \"Peter's\nmother is Jane, and she's also Paul's mother. So Peter's mother is\nPaul's mother; so if Peter's mother is Mary, Paul's mother is Mary.\" I\nthink intuitions differ on these cases. I don't find the inferences as\nbad as many informants do, and generally speaking intuitions about\nknowledge-contravening indicatives are rather fuzzy. So I'm just going\nto focus on the case where the conclusions are open.\n\nErnest @Adams1998 has objected to the claim that instances of (2)\nalways seem like acceptable inferences using the following example.\n\n7.  Everyone who was at the party is a student. So if the Chancellor was\n    at the party, the Chancellor is a student. (Adams 1998: 289)\n\nI actually think this sounds like a perfectly fine inference. If I say\nthat everyone at the party was a student, and someone takes me to\nthereby to be committed to the claim that if the Chancellor was at the\nparty, she too is a student, then I won't complain. But perhaps my\nintuitions here are odd. Here is an intuition that I feel more\ncomfortable with. If the conclusion of (7) is an open indicative, that\nis if it isn't ruled out that the Chancellor is a student, then the\ninference in (7) sounds perfectly fine to me.\n\nAdams has to object to (2) because it provides counterexamples to a\nthesis he defends at some length. This thesis is that an inference from\na single premise to a conditional *If p then q* is a good inference iff\nnecessarily the probability of *q* given *p* is not lower than the\nprobability of the premise. Schema (3) is also a problem here as well.\nIn each case it isn't too hard to find instances where the probability\nof the premise is arbitrarily high, but the probability of the\nconclusion's consequent given its antecedent is arbitrarily low. For\ninstance, let the salient probabilities be as below: $$\\begin{aligned}\nPr(f(a) = f(b) = d) &= 1-x \\\\\nPr(f(a) = c \\wedge f(b) = e) &= x\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIf we let *x* be arbitrarily small, then the probability of the premise\n*f*(*a*) = *f*(*b*) will be arbitrarily high. But the conditional\nprobability of *f*(*b*) = *c* given *f*(*a*) = *c* will be arbitrarily\nlow. So the probability preservation property Adams has highlighted\nisn't what is always preserved in good inferences.\n\nEach of the inferences in (1) to (3) is, in some sense, a good\ninference. It is easy to prove from that fact, and the assumption that\ngood inferences are valid implications, that the conditional *If p then\nq* is true if *p* is false or *q* is true. If we assume Modus Ponens is\nvalid (as I will throughout) then we can strengthen this conditional to\na biconditional. It is obviously easy to prove this using the goodness\nof (1). Here is a proof that uses just (3), and some weak\nassumptions about truth. Line 1 is the only assumption, and every line\nseems to follow from the one before it.\n\n1.  The truth value of *p* is the truth value of *p* & *q*\n\n2.  So if the truth value of *p* is true, then the truth value of *p* &\n    *q* is true\n\n3.  So if *p* is true, then *p* & *q* is true\n\n4.  So if *p*, then *p* & *q*\n\n5.  So if *p*, then *q*\n\nI've assumed here that we can treat *The truth value of p is true*, *p\nis true*, and *p* as equivalent, but this seems uncontroversial. And on\npretty much any conditional logic there is, the move from (4) to (5)\nwill be valid. Assuming bivalence, (1) is equivalent to the disjunction\n*p* is false or *q* is true. So we can infer from that disjunction to\n*If p, then q* without using the schema (1).\n\nThis might all suggest that open indicatives should be interpreted as\nmaterial implications. But there is some data that tells against that.\nThis suggestion from Richard @Bradley2000 seems correct.\n\n> [O]ne cannot be certain that *B* is not the case if one thinks that\n> it is possible that if *A* then *B*, unless one rules out the\n> possibility of *A* as well. You cannot, for instance, hold that we\n> might go to the beach, but that we certainly won't go swimming and at\n> the same time consider it possible that if we go to the beach we will\n> go swimming! To do so would reveal a misunderstanding of the\n> indicative conditional (or just plain inconsistency). [@Bradley2000\n> 220]\n\nMore generally, someone who regards *A* as an epistemic possibility, but\nknows that *B* is false, should regard If *A*, *B* also as something\nthey know to be false. Bradley puts this in probabilistic terms as\nfollows.\n\nPreservation Condition:\n\n:   If *Pr(A*) \\> 0 but *Pr(B*) = 0, then *Pr(A* $\\rightarrow$ *B*) = 0\n\nThis isn't obviously the best formulation of his principle. In the\nexample, what matters is not that *A* has non-zero probability, but that\nit is something that might be true. (These are different. The\nprobability that the average temperature in Ithaca on January 1 next\nyear will be *exactly* 32 degree Fahrenheit is 0, but that might be the\nexact temperature.) The structure of the inference looks to be what is\ngiven in (8), where K*p* means the relevant agents knows that *p*.\n\n8.  $\\neg$K $\\neg$*A*\\\n    K$\\neg$*B*\\\n    So, K$\\neg$(If *A, B*)\n\nBut this is not valid if the conditional is a material implication. So\nnow it is *impossible* to accept all of the intuitively plausible\nprinciples about inference involving conditionals are truth-preserving.\nThere must be some other explanation of the reasonableness of all these\ninferences other than their being valid implications.\n\nThe best explanation I know of this 'reasonableness' is the one endorsed\nby Daniel @Nolan2003 as an explanation of inferences like (1). Nolan\nsays that given an epistemic theory of the indicative, we can say that\neach of the inferences has the following property. Any speaker who knows\nthe premise is in a position to truly assert the conclusion. Call an\ninference like this, where knowledge of the premise implies truth of the\nconclusion, epistemically acceptable. If we are confusing valid\nimplications with epistemically acceptable inferences, this could\nexplain why all of (1) through (3) seem reasonable. More\nimpressively, this hypothesis of Nolan's explains why (8) seems\nreasonable, given an epistemic theory of indicatives. If we know that\n*A* is true in some epistemic possibilities, but *B* is false in all of\nthem, then all the epistemically salient alternatives where *A* is true\nwill be ones where *B* is false. So (8) will turn out to be a good\ninference, by Nolan's criteria. So (8), like (1) through (3), is\nepistemically acceptable. So given Nolan's epistemic account of\nreasonable inference, and an epistemic theory of indicative\nconditionals, we can explain the reasonableness of all five problematic\ninferences. In the absence of any other good explanation of this\nreasonableness, this seems to me to be a good reason to accept both\nNolan's account and an epistemic theory of indicative conditionals.\n\n### The Simple Epistemic Theory of Conditionals\n\nFor concreteness, I'll work in this paper with a very simple theory of\nconditionals. I assume that in general a conditional *If p*, *q* has the\nlogical form C(*p*, *q*, X), where C is the conditional relation, and X\nis a plural variable that denotes some propositions taken as fixed in\nthe context. The simple epistemic theory makes two additions to this\nbasic assumption.\n\nFirst, there is some epistemic relation R such a proposition *s* is\namong the X iff some salient individual *i* stands in relation R to *s*.\nWe'll use R(*i*) to represent those propositions. It will become\nimportant later that X is genuinely a plural variable, so R(*i*) is not\na set of propositions, or a fusion of propositions (whatever that would\nbe). Rather, I just mean to be plurally referring to the propositions\nthat stand in relation R to *i*. (Note that I'm not saying anything here\nabout how *i* is determined; my preferred theory is that it is the\n*evaluator* of any conditional utterance, but nothing in the simple\nepistemic theory turns on this.)\n\nA very conservative version of the theory says that R is the knowledge\nrelation. One can liberalise the theory in two respects. First, we can\nsay that R is the 'position to know' relation. Second, we can say that\n*sRi* iff someone salient to *i* knows that S. A maximally liberal\nversion of the theory says that *sRi* iff someone salient to *i* is in a\nposition to know that S. I'm not going to argue for this here, but I\nthink this maximally liberal option is the way to proceed, so that's\nwhat I'm going to adopt for the sake of exposition. Nothing turns on\nthis adoption in what follows. Indeed the arguments against\ncontextualism and for relativism are stronger the more constrained R is,\nso this is tilting the playing field away from my preferred outcome.\n\nSecond, the simple theory I have in mind says that C is basically just\nthe a priori entailment relation. So C(*p*, *q*, X) is true iff *p* plus\nX a priori entail *q*. If you want to say that entailment is a relation\nbetween a set and a proposition, the claim is that the union of {*p*}\nand {*s*: *s* is among the X} a priori entail that *q*.\n\nThere are several ways in which one might want to complicate the simple\nepistemic theory. My preferred theory involves some of these\ncomplications. Here are some complications that have been proposed in\nvarious ways.\n\nFirst, we might change C to stipulate that whenever *p* and *q* are\ntrue, C(*p*, *q*, X) is true. This is equivalent to endorsing strong\ncentring in the sense of @Lewis1973a. Assuming every proposition in X is\ntrue, as I've done above, means that we've already guaranteed that\nC(*p*, *q*, X) is false when *p* is true and *q* is false.\n\nSecond, we might deny bivalence in the following way. Say that\nC(*p*, *q*, X) is true iff *p* and X a priori entail that *q*, false if\nit is not true and also *p* and X entail $\\neg$*q*, and indeterminate in\ntruth value otherwise. Going down this path allows one to endorse\nconditional excluded middle, as supported by @Stalnaker1981. Denying\nbivalence does not compel acceptance of conditional excluded middle, but\nit becomes an interesting possibility once you go down this path.\n\nThird, we might say that R is a disjunctive relation, so some\npropositions are among the R(*i*) because they stand in an epistemic\nrelation to *i*, and others are in because they are in some sense 'fixed\nfacts' of *i*'s world. @Nolan2003 uses a quite different formalism, but\nif we wanted to translate his theory into this formalism, that's what\nwe'd do.\n\nFourth, we could make C a more complicated relation. In particular, we\ncould make it in a sense non-monotonic, e.g. by saying that\nC(*p*, *q*, X) holds iff the epistemic probability of *q* given *p* and\nX is sufficiently high. If C is non-monotonic in this sense, then we can\nhave a conditional logic that looks like some of the conditional logics\nin @Lewis1973a.\n\nFor what it's worth, I favour the first and (a version of) the second of\nthese complications, but not the third and fourth. Defending those\npreferences would take us too far afield however. What I mostly want to\nshow in this paper is that whatever form of epistemic theory we adopt,\nwe should adopt what I'll call an indexical relativist version of that\ntheory. So I'll just presuppose the simple epistemic theory throughout,\nbecause the general form of the argument should be easily adoptable\nwhichever complications one adds on. The task of the next section is to\nintroduce indexical relativism.\n\n### Four Kinds of Sensitivity\n\nLet's say that one is tempted towards a kind of moral relativism. So\nwhen old Horace, way back when, \"Premarital sex is morally worse than\ndriving drunk\" he said something true in some sense, and when modern\nKayla now says \"Driving drunk is morally worse than premarital sex\", she\nalso says something true in a sense. How might we formalise these\nintuitions? (Not, I might add, intuitions that I share.) There are a few\nsimple options, breaking down along two distinct axes. To save space,\nI'll write P for pre-marital sex, D for driving drunk, and \\< for the\nrelation is morally worse than, in what follows.[^2]\n\nThe first axis concerns the nature of propositions about the moral. One\noption is to say that moral codes are part of the propositions that are\nthe content of Horace's and Kayla's utterances. For example, we might\nsay that when old Horace makes his utterance, its content is the\nproposition *P* \\< *D in M~O~*, where M~O~ is Horace's old moral code.\nConversely, when Kayla makes her utterance, its content is the\nproposition *D* \\< *P in M~N~*. where M~N~ is Kayla's new moral code.\nThis option, as @SayreMcCord1991 notes, treats 'moral' as being like\n'legal'. When we say \"Insulting the Thai monarch is illegal\", the\ncontent of our utterance is the proposition *Insulting the Thai monarch\nis illegal in L*, where L is some salient legal code. That's why typical\nutterances of that sentence in Bangkok are true, but typical utterances\nof it in St Andrews are false. Call this option *indexicalism*, since it\nthinks there is an indexical element in the semantic structure of what\nHorace and Kayla say. Because this will become crucial later, what I'm\ntaking to be essential to indexicalism is simply the view that there is\na moral code in the proposition expressed, not that it is the moral code\nof the speaker.\n\nA quite different option is to say that the content of Horace's\nutterance is simply the proposition *P* \\< *D*. The relativism comes in\nbecause it turns out that propositions are true or false relative to,\ninter alia, moral codes. The proposition *P* \\< *D* is true in M~O~, and\nfalse in M~N~. The analogy here is to the way the very same proposition\ncan be true in one world false in another. This option, which I'll call\n*non-indexicalism*, says that moral codes function much like worlds;\nthey are things relative to which propositions are true or false. The\nnon-indexicalist takes @Kaplan1989 to be on the right track in saying\nthat propositions are true or false relative to world-time pairs, but\nthinks that the indices relative to which propositions are true or false\nare even more fine-grained than that.\n\nThe second axis concerns which context is relevant to the truth of the\nutterance. One option is to say that it is the context of utterance. A\nsecond option is to say that it is the context of evaluation. Following\n@MacFarlane2007-SMNIC [@MacFarlane2009-MACNC], I'll call the first\noption *contextualism*, and the second option *relativism*. The point\nthat's worth focussing on here is that what choice we make here cuts\nacross the choice we make on the first axis. So there are four options\navailable. To set these out, we need to introduce a third character\n(call him Deval) who *assesses* Horace's and Kayla's utterances. For\nconcreteness, call Deval's moral code M~A~, and say that it agrees with\nM~N~ on the point at issue. Then here are the four options we have.\n\n-   *Indexical Contextualism*. The propositions that are the content of\n    Horace's and Kayla's utteranes include moral codes, and which code\n    that is is determined by features of their utterance. So the content\n    of Horace's utterance is the proposition *P* \\< *D in M~O~*, and\n    Kayla's the proposition *D* \\< *P in M~N~*. Deval should assess each\n    of them as having uttered truths.\n\n-   *Non-indexical Relativism*. The propositions that are the content of\n    their utterances do not include moral codes, and their utterances\n    are only true or false relative to a moral code provided by an\n    assessor. So the content of Horace's utterance is simply *P* \\< *D*,\n    and Kayla's *D* \\< *P*. Since in M~A~ *D* \\< *P* is true, Deval\n    should assess Horace's utterance as false, and Kayla's as true.\n\n-   *Non-indexical contextualism*. The propositions that are the content\n    of their utterances do not include moral codes, but the truth-value\n    a moral utterance is the truth-value of its content in the context\n    it is expressed in. So the content of Horace's utterance is simply\n    *P *\\< *D*, and Kayla's *D* \\< *P*. Since Horace makes his utterance\n    in a context where *P* \\< *D* is part of the prevailing moral code,\n    his utterance is true. So Deval and Kayla should assess it as true,\n    even though they think the proposition Horace expressed is false.\n    This isn't contradictory; a person in another possible world can\n    make a true utterance by expressing a proposition that is (actually)\n    false, and for the non-indexical contextualist, moral codes are in a\n    way like worlds. Kayla's utterance is true as well, since it is made\n    in a different context.\n\n-   *Indexical relativism*. The propositions that are the content of\n    Horace's and Kayla's utteranes include moral codes, and which code\n    that is is determined by features of the context of assessment. So\n    when Deval hears of these two utterances, he should interpret the\n    content of Horace's utterance to be *P* \\< *D in M~A~*, and of\n    Kayla's to be *D* \\< *P in M~A~*. Since the latter proposition is\n    true, he should interpret Kayla's utterance as true, and Horace's as\n    false.\n\nIt might make it easier to picture these positions in a small table, as\nfollows.\n\nm0.29 \\| m0.29 \\| m0.29   & The speaker's moral code matters to\nutterance truth (contextualism) & The assessor's moral code matters to\nutterance truth (relativism) Propositions include moral codes\n(indexicalism) & Indexical Contextualism & Indexical Relativism\nPropositions are true or false relative to moral codes\n(non-indexicalism) & Non-indexical Contextualism & Non-indexical\nRelativism\n\nThe modern discussion of non-indexical relativism, though not under that\nname, traces to @MacFarlane2003-MACFCA-2. The modern discussion of\nnon-indexical contextualism, under that name, traces to\n@MacFarlane2007-SMNIC [@MacFarlane2009-MACNC]. Much of this paper, and\nall of this section, is about setting out the distinctions that\nMacFarlane makes in the latter papers between indexicalism and\ncontextualism. But once we do that, we see that there is a position,\nindexical relativism, that hasn't had much attention. I plan to change\nthat.\n\nBefore we get on to the content of indexical relativism, a small note on\nnomenclature is in order. I've picked the names I have so (a) we'll have\na compositional naming scheme and (b) we get 'non-indexical\ncontextualism' to denote what it denotes in MacFarlane's terminology.\nThis does mean using the term 'indexical relativism' in a slightly\ndifferent way to how it has been used in the part. @Einheuser2008 and\n@LopezDeSaMs each use 'indexical relativism' to mean just what I've\nmeant by 'indexical contextualism'. @Kolbel2004 also uses the term\n'indexical relativism', though @LopezDeSa2007a argues that he too just\nmeans contextualism, and I'm inclined to agree. So though the name had\nbeen previously used, it had not been used to express a distinctive\nview.\n\nOn the other hand, there had been some discussions of the position I'm\ncalling 'indexical relativism'. In @Egan2005-EGAEMI we call such a\nposition 'content relativism', though @Cappelen2008 uses that term for a\nslightly different position. In @MacFarlane2005-MACMSO he discusses\n'assessment indexicality', a property sentences have if they express\ndifferent propositions in different contexts. So there doesn't seem to\nbe a settled terminology for this corner of the table, and I propose to\ntake 'indexical relativism' for it.\n\n### Indexical Relativism\n\nIn \"Judge Dependence, Epistemic Modals, and Predicates of Personal\nTaste\", Tamina Stephenson proposes a variant on Peter Lasersohn's\n[-@Lasersohn2005] relativist account of predicates of personal taste.\nStephenson proposes that predicates of personal taste always encode\nrelations between an object and an assessor. So when we say \"Warm beer\nis tasty\" we express some proposition of the form *Warm beer is tasty to\nX*. So far, this is not particularly new. What is interesting is\nStephenson's suggestion that some of the time (but not always) there is\na 'silent nominal' PRO~J~, whose value is the 'judge'. So the utterance\nwill be true as judged by *y* iff warm beer is tasty to *y*. There are\nseveral advantages to positing a tacit parameter. One that Stephenson\nstresses is that in some cases, e.g. when we are talking about the\ntastiness of various brands of cat food, we can let the value of this\nparameter be the cat rather than any human. But, by letting it by\ndefault take the value PRO~J~, Stephenson shows that we can accommodate\nmost of the intuitions that motivate Lasersohn's relativism.\n\nNow Stephenson is not an indexical relativist, as I've defined that\nposition. For according to the indexical relativist, propositions are\nonly true or false relative to worlds. And Stephenson has propositions\nbe world-time-judge triples. But I think we can adopt her idea to set\nout a kind of indexical relativism. I'll first say how this could go in\nthe moral case, then apply it to conditionals.\n\nThe moral indexical relativist says that the context-neutral content of\nan utterance like Kayla's is not a complete proposition. Rather, it is a\npropositional frame that we might express as *D* \\< *P* *in M(PRO~J~*),\nwhere M(*x*) is *x*'s moral code, and PRO~J~ is (as always) the judge.\nRelative to any judge, the content of her utterance is that *D* \\< *P*\nin that judge's moral code. So relative to Horace, the content of her\nutterance is the false proposition *D* \\< *P* *in M~O~*, and relative to\nDeval it is the true proposition *D* \\< *P* *in M~A~*. That's why it is\nfine for Horace to say \"I disagree\", or \"That's false\", or \"She speaks\nfalsely\", and fine for Deval to say \"I agree\", or \"That's true\", or \"She\nspeaks truly\". Now I reject any kind of moral relativism, so this isn't\nmy theory for moral language, but it's a theory that could in principle\nwork.\n\nWhat I will defend is indexical relativism for indicative conditionals.\nIn general, the content of an indicative conditional *If p*, *q* is\nC(*p*, *q*, X), where the propositions in X are the 'background'\npropositions relative to which the conditional is assessed, and C is the\nconditional relation[^3]. An epistemic theory of indicatives says that\nthe value of X is (by default) *R(x*), where *r* is some epistemic\nrelation (on a broad construal of 'epistemic') and *x* is a salient\nindividual. The indexical relativist position is that the content of an\nutterance of a conditional is (by default) a propositional frame that we\nmight express as C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)). Relative to an assessor *a*,\nthe content is C(*p*, *q*, *R(a*)).\n\nThe argument for this position will come in sections 6 and 7. In section\n6 I'll argue against indexical contextualism. The argument will be that\nif indexical contextualism were true, it should be harder to *agree*\nwith an utterer of a conditional than it actually is. Then in section 7,\nI'll argue for indexicalism. The argument will be that we need to posit\nthe third argument place in the conditional relation to explain what\ngoes wrong in some arguments that are alleged to be both instances of\nmodus ponens and invalid. I'll argue (not particularly originally) that\nthese arguments involve a shift of a tacit parameter, namely X. This\nsuggests that X exists. Between those two arguments, we can conclude\nthat indexical relativism is true. Before that, I want to look at some\narguments against indexical relativism.\n\nIn @Egan2005-EGAEMI we mention two arguments against this position. One\nis that indexical relativism is incompatible with a Stalnakerian account\nof the role of assertion. Assertions, we said, are proposals to add\nsomething, namely their content, to the context set. But if the content\nof an assertion is different in different contexts, then it is\nimpossible to add *it* to the context set. And that, we thought, was a\nproblem. I now think there's a relatively simple way around this.[^4] If\nyou want to add a proposition to the context set, then there has to be a\ncontext. And relative to any context, a conditional does have a content.\nSo given any context, the content of the conditional (relative to that\ncontext) can be added to the context set. And that's all the\nStalnakerian account requires.\n\nPerhaps a stronger version of this objection is that even if you can\nfigure out, given the rules, what move a speaker is making according to\nthis theory, this isn't a move that sensible speakers should want to\nmake. So imagine that A says that if *p*, then *q*, and says this\nbecause they have just discovered something no one else knows, namely\n$\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*). Now B hears this, not because A tells her, but\nbecause of a fortuitous echo. B takes A to be expressing the proposition\nC(*p*, *q*, *R*(*B*)), and proposing that it be added to the context\nset. But that's a terrible proposal, we might object, because A has no\nreason to know that C(*p*, *q*, *R*(*B*)), since she knows nothing about\nB's knowledge. Since there is nothing wrong with A's utterance, and the\ntheory interprets her as making an indefensible proposal to add\nsomething to the context set, the theory is wrong.\n\nThis objection is potentially a powerful one, and any version of\nindexical relativism must say something about such an objection. What I\nsay is that the objection misconstrues *R*(*B*). If *B* is considering\nan utterance by *A*, even if *B* does not know that *A* is the author of\nthat utterance, then any proposition that *A* knows is among the\n*R*(*B*). I think this holds quite generally. If *A* knowably asserts\nthat *p*, and *B* considers it and says \"That might not be true\", what B\nsays is false, even if *B* does not know whether *p* is true. The reason\nis that *B* is taking *A*'s knowledge to be, for the time being,\nrelevant to the context of her utterance. So in short, the knowledge on\nwhich *A* relies for her utterance is carried in to every context in\nwhich that very utterance is assessed. That's why it is acceptable for\n*A* to make such a sweeping proposal, namely that for every *x* who\nevaluates her utterance, C(*p*, *q*, *R*(*x*)) should be added to the\ncommon ground of *x*'s context. This response relies heavily on specific\nfeatures of the interaction between conditionals and context, and I\ndon't think it generalises very far. It may be that this style of\nobjection does defeat some prima facie plausible versions of indexical\nrelativism, though it does not touch indexical relativism about open\nindicatives.\n\nA related objection, to a quite different proposal, is made in\n@KingStanley2005. They oppose the theory that the semantic content of an\nutterance is something like a character. They say the content has to be\na proposition, and the reason for this is that \"Our understanding of a\nsentence in a context is due to a compositional procedure that\ncalculates the content of the whole sentence from the referential\ncontents of its parts.\" This seems like a good reason for not taking the\nsemantic content of a sentence in general to be its character. And we\nmight worry that it could be extended to an argument against the view\nthat the content of a conditional is a function from contexts of\nassessment to propositions. But on closer inspection it seems like no\nsuch generalisation is possible. After all, someone interpreting a\nconditional *can* assign a value to the variable X that takes different\nvalues in different contexts of assessment. They can just 'replace'\nPRO~J~ with themselves when interpreting the conditional. The important\npoint here is that the view that the utterance does not have a\ncontext-neutral semantic content is consistent with it having a content\nrelative to any interpreter, and hence to interpreters discovering its\ncontent (relative to them).\n\nThe other objection we made to indexical relativism in the earlier paper\nwas that it left as unexplained some phenomena about the behaviour of\nepistemic modals in propositional attitude reports that the\nnon-indexical theory could explain. I still think this is an advantage\nof the non-indexical theory, but I don't think it is decisive. (In\ngeneral, it isn't a deal breaker that one theory has to take as a brute\nfact something that a rival theory explain, although it does count in\nfavour of the rival.) I'll say more about this objection when we discuss\npropositional attitude reports in more detail in section 6. But first, I\nneed to introduce some facts about the behaviour of plural pronouns that\nmy indexical relativist theory will exploit.\n\n### Partial Binding\n\nPhilosophical orthodoxy has it that all pronouns fall into one of two\nbroad categories. On the one hand, there are deictic pronouns, whose job\nit is to refer (presumably directly) to a contextually salient object.\nOn the other hand, there are pronouns whose job it is to denote (one way\nor another), an object denoted earlier in the discourse. Examples of the\nlatter kind include the tokens of 'she' in (5.1) to (5.3).\n\n1.  If Suzy enters the competition, **she** will win.\n\n2.  Every student will get the grade that **she** deserves.\n\n3.  If a dictator has a daughter, **she** is pampered by the state.\n\nI'm not going to go into the (very interesting) debates about how many\ndifferent kinds of pronouns are represented by the three tokens of 'she'\nabove, nor about which of these pronouns are directly referential, which\nare quantifiers, and which are neither of these. All I want to note is\nthat the pronouns represented here fall into a different category than\nsimple deictic pronouns, that refer to a contextually salient\nindividual.\n\nThomas [@McKay2006 Ch. 9] has argued that the behaviour of plural\npronouns mirrors the behaviour of singular pronouns. He shows that for\nevery different kind of singular pronoun we can find, or even purport to\nfind, we can find plural pronouns behaving the same way. The following\nthree sentences, which are about a film school where girls make films in\nlarge groups, have pronouns that behave just like the three tokens of\n'she' above.\n\n4.  If some girls enter the competition, **they** will win.\n\n5.  Some students will produce a better film than we expect **them** to.\n\n6.  If a student dislikes some girls, **their** work suffers.\n\nWhat is quite noteworthy about plural pronouns, however, is that they\nneed not fall into one of the two major categories I mentioned at the\nstart of the section.[^5] It is possible to have a plural pronoun whose\ndenotation is determined partially by context, and partially by the\ndenotation of earlier parts of the discourse. Consider, for example,\n(5.7), as uttered by Jason.\n\n7.  If Ted comes over, we'll go and get some beers.\n\nIt seems the 'we' there denotes Ted and Jason. It denotes Jason because\nit's a first-person plural pronoun, and Jason is the speaker, and the\nspeaker is always among the denotata of a first-person plural pronoun.\nArguably, the 'we' is anaphoric on 'Ted', but this does not mean it\ndenotes only Ted. Rather, it means that Ted is among the denotata of\n'we', the others being determined by context. One might object that\nreally 'we' in (5.7) is deictic, and Ted is among its denotata because\nhe has been made salient. I think that's probably a mistake, but I don't\nwant to press the point. Rather, I'll note some other cases where such\nan explanation is unacceptable. The following example, due to Jeff King\n(p.c.) shows that 'we' can behave like a donkey pronoun.\n\n8.  If any friend comes over, we'll go and get some beers.\n\nIntuitively that's true, as uttered by Jason, just in case for some\nsalient class of friends, if any member of that class comes over, Jason\nand that friend will go and get beers. Now it is controversial just how\nto account for donkey pronouns in general, and I'm not going to take a\nside on that. But however they work, donkey pronouns seem to fall on the\nsecond side of the divide I mentioned at the top of the section. And\nfirst person singular pronouns are paradigmatic instances of pronouns\nthat get their reference from context. What's notable is that\nfirst-person plural pronouns can display both kinds of features.\n\nThis is not a particularly new point. Example (5.9) was introduced by\nBarbara Partee in 1989, and there is a longer discussion of the\nphenomena by Phillipe Schlenker in his [-@Schlenker2003]. The latter\npaper is the source for (5.10) and (5.11).\n\n9.  John often comes over for Sunday brunch. Whenever someone else comes\n    over too, we (all) end up playing trios. @Partee1989\n\n10. Each of my colleagues is so difficult that at some point or other\n    we've had an argument. @Schlenker2003\n\n11. [Talking about John] Each of his colleagues is so difficult that\n    at some point or other they've had an argument. @Schlenker2003\n\nSchlenker describes what is going on here as 'partial binding', and I'll\nfollow his lead here. The 'we' in (5.10) is bound to the earlier\nquantifier phrase 'Each of my colleagues', but, as above, this does not\nmean that it merely denotes (relative to a variable assignment) one of\nthe speaker's colleagues. Rather, it denotes a plurality that includes\nthe colleague, and includes the speaker. And the speaker is supplied as\none of the denotata by context.\n\nThe reason for mentioning all this here is that my theory of how\nconditionals behave involves, among other things, partial binding. The\ngeneral semantic structure of a conditional is C(*p*, *q*, X), where X\nis a plural variable that denotes some propositions. I think X can,\nindeed often is, partially bound. In simple cases a proposition is among\nthe X just in case it stands in relation *R* to a salient individual\n*i*. In more complex cases, X is partially bound to an earlier phrase,\nand in virtue of that some proposition *s* is among the X. But the\npropositions that stand in relation *R* to *i* are also among the X,\nbecause X is only partially bound to the earlier proposition. If there\nwere no other instances of partial binding in natural language, this\nwould be a fairly ad hoc position to take. But there shouldn't be any\ntheoretical problem with assuming that tacit variables can behave the\nway that overt pronouns behave.\n\n### Against Indexical Contexualism\n\nOne usual way to argue for relativist theories is to appeal to instances\nof faultless disagreement. It is natural to think that such arguments\ncould work in the case of open indicatives. Since Gibbard (1981) there\nhas been a lot of discussion over cases where A knows $\\neg$(*p* &\n$\\neg$*q*), and B knows $\\neg$(*p* & *q*). It seems A can truly, even\nknowledgeably, say *If p, q*, and B can truly, even knowledgeably, say\n*If p,* $\\neg$*q*. And, in the right context, it might seem that this is\na case where A and B disagree. One might try and argue that the only way\nto explain this faultless disagreement between A and B is through some\nvariety of relativistic semantics. I think that will be a hard argument\nto make out for four reasons.\n\nFirst, some people hold that the notion of a faultless disagreement is\nincoherent. I suspect that's wrong, and the concept is coherent, but\nmaking this argument stick would require showing that faultless\ndisagreement is indeed coherent. I want the argument for indexical\nrelativism about open indicatives to not rely on the coherence of\nfaultless disagreement.\n\nSecond, two people can disagree without there being any proposition that\none says is true and the other is false. (This should be familiar from\ndebates about non-cognitivism in ethics.) If A says \"I like ice cream\"\nand B says \"I don't like ice cream\", then there is a natural sense in\nwhich they are disagreeing, for instance. But arguments from\ndisagreement for relativism generally require that when two people\ndisagree, there is a proposition that one accepts and the other rejects,\nand that may not be true.\n\nThird, there is some special reason to think that this is what happens\nin the conditionals case. In this case A and B are having a\n*conditional* disagreement. Perhaps we intuit that A and B are\ndisagreeing merely because of this conditional disagreement. For\ncomparison, if A and B had made a conditional bet, we would describe\nthem as having made a bet in ordinary discourse, even if the bet is not\nrealised because the condition is not satisfied.\n\nFinally, as @Grice1989 showed, there can be cases where we naturally\ndescribe A and B as disagreeing in virtue of two utterances, even though\n(a) those utterances are simple assertions, and (b) the assertions are\nconsistent. Grice's case is where A says that *p* or *q* is true, and B\nsays that *p* or *r* is true, with stress on *r*, where *q* and *r* are\nobviously incompatible. Perhaps the natural thing to say here too is\nthat A and B have a conditional disagreement; conditional on $\\neg$*p*,\nA thinks that *q* and B thinks that *r*. So this argument seems to need\na lot of work.\n\nAn apparently stronger argument comes from indirect speech reports. It\nseems that in any case where a speaker, say Clarke, says \"If the doctor\ndidn't do it, the lawyer did\", then in any other context, we can report\nthat by saying \"Clarke said that if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer\ndid.\" This might look to pose a problem for indexical contextualism.\n\nAssuming that the content of *If p, q* is C(*p*, *q*, *R(i*)), where *i*\nis some person made salient by the context of utterance. Let *p* be *The\ndoctor didn't do it*, and *q* be *The lawyer did it*, *c* be Clarke, and\n*h* be the person who reports what Clarke said. Then it seems that what\nClarke said is C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). But it seems that the content of\nwhat comes after the *that* in the report is C(*p*, *q*, *R(h*)). But\nsince *R(c*) might not be the same as *R(h*), this should look like a\nbad report.\n\nI think this is something of a problem for the indexical contextualist,\nbut it isn't beyond repair. It could be that the variable *i* in the\nspeech report is bound to the name at the start of the report, so the\nvalue of *i* in *Clarke said* C(*p*, *q*, *R(i*)) is simply Clarke\nherself. This is a slightly odd kind of binding, but it isn't\nimpossible, so this doesn't quite rule out a contextualist theory.\n\nAs @MacFarlane2009-MACNC argues, the felicity of homophonic reports does\nnot raise a problem for either kind of non-indexical theory. I'll argue\nthat it also doesn't pose a problem for indexical relativism.\n\nThe indexical relativist thinks that, on its most natural\ninterpretation, the content of Clarke's utterance is C(*p*, *q*,\n*R(*PRO~J~)). Similarly, it might be thought that the natural\ninterpretation of what comes after the *that* in the report is C(*p*,\n*q*, *R(*PRO~J~)). So it isn't surprising that the report is acceptable.\n\nI can imagine an objector making the following speech. \"Assume that\nClarke's utterance was sincere. Then it seems natural to say that Clarke\nbelieves that if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did. But it is odd\nto think that Clarke believes C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)). What she\nbelieves is C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). The only way to get belief reports to\nwork on the indexical contextualist theory is to insist that the *i* is\nbound to the subject of the report. But once you say that it is ad hoc\nto deny that the *i* is also bound to the subject in a speech report.\nAnd not just ad hoc, it implies that (relative to our context) Clarke\ndoesn't believe what she says, for she says C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)) but\nbelieves C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). On the other hand if the *i* is bound to\nthe speaker in a speech report, so what Clarke is said to have said is\nC(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)), then (a) you have no advantage over the indexical\ncontextualist, and (b) you can't explain why the report is felicitous,\nsince you say she says something else, namely C(*p*, *q*, *R(*PRO~J~)).\"\n\nI have three responses to this critic. The first is that I'm not\nconvinced that having a different treatment of belief reports and speech\nreports, letting *i* be PRO~J~ in speech reports and the believer in\nbelief reports, is too terrible. The argument that it would be ad hoc to\ntreat speech reports and belief reports separately seems weak. It is\nworse if we end up, because of the structure of the theory, accusing\nClarke of insincerity. One way of avoiding that response is to accept\nthe binding proposal. But it isn't the only way. If we make two\nassumptions about C and *R*, we can sidestep the danger.\n\nThe first assumption is that C is monotonic in the sense that\nC(*p*, *q*, X + Y) is entailed by C(*p*, *q*, X). The second is that\n*xRp* is true in case someone salient to *x* bears *R* to *p*, and the\nutterer of the judged sentence is salient (in this sense) to the judge.\n(Note this is exactly the assumption that I made earlier to defend my\nproposal about what effect uttering a conditional has on the\nStalnakerian context.) Now not all indexical relativists will want to\nmake these assumptions, but I'm happy to do so. Now if Clarke believes\n*If p*, *q*, she believes C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). So she either believes\nshe knows $\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*), or believes she knows some things\nthat (perhaps unbeknownst to her) entail it. That means that, whoever\nthe judge of her utterance is, she believes that *R*(PRO~J~) either\nincludes or entails $\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*). So she believes C(*p*, *q*,\n*R(*PRO~J~)), as required.\n\nSo I don't think the indexical relativist has to concede to the critic\nthat speech reports involve binding in this way. But I might be wrong\nabout this, so my second and third responses concede this point, and\nargue that it doesn't harm the indexical relativist position.\n\nThe second response is that even with this concession, the indexical\nrelativist has a small advantage over the indexical contextualist.\nDrawing on Stephenson's work, we could argue that (a) PRO~J~ is often\nthe value of a tacit variable, and (b) whenever it is the default value\nof a variable, then that variable is bound to the subject of a\npropositional attitude report. If that is the case, then the indexical\nrelativist could unify a number of different cases that would have to be\ntreated separately by the indexical contextualist. Still, it is true\nthat the non-indexicalist has an even larger advantage here, since they\ncan explain why this (apparent) binding holds, but I don't think this\nadvantage is decisive. This is the one argument for non-indexicalism\nthat I mentioned in section 4 might still have some force, though not I\nthink enough to override the argument for indexicalism in the next\nsection.\n\nThe third response is that the indexical relativist has a simple\nexplanation of why the reports are natural, even on the assumption that\nthe *i* is bound to the speaker. First consider a similar case. Imagine\nClarke had simply said \"The lawyer did it\", i.e. *q*. It would be\nnatural to report her as having said that the lawyer actually did it.\nNow one can imagine being surprised at this. Clarke said something\ncontingently true, but we reported her using a proposition *that the\nlawyer actually did it*, that is necessarily true. How is this possible?\nWell, it is because in saying *q*, she immediately and obviously commits\nherself to *Actually q*, and if a speaker immediately and obviously\ncommits themselves to a proposition in virtue of an utterance, then it\nis natural to report them as having said that proposition. Speakers are\ngenerally committed to the truth of the utterances from their own\nperspective, so Clarke is committed to C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)). (Arguably\nthat is all she is committed to, as opposed to C(*p*, *q*,\n*R(*PRO~J~)).) So we can report her as having said C(*p*, *q*,\n*R(*PRO~J~)). And if *i* is bound to the speaker, that is what we do\nreport her as having said by saying \"Clarke said that if the doctor\ndidn't do it, the lawyer did.\"[^6]\n\nSo both the argument from disagreement and the argument from speech\nreport against indexical contextualism have run up against some blocks.\nThere is another argument, however, that is effective against it. This\nis an argument from easy agreement. Assume again that Clarke said \"If\nthe doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did.\" Assume that an arbitrary\nperson, call him Rebus, knows that Clarke made this utterance, and knows\nthat either the doctor or the lawyer did it, that is knows that\n$\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*). On that basis alone, it will be natural for\nRebus to make any of the following utterances. \"I agree\"; \"That's\nright\"; \"That's true\"; \"What she said is true\"; \"She spoke truly\". Any\nof these are hard to explain on the indexical contextualist view,\naccording to which agreement should be harder to get than this.\n\nOn the indexical contextualist view, Clarke said C(*p*, *q*, *R(c*)).\nNow on most accounts of what *r* is, Rebus need not know that $\\neg$(*p*\n& $\\neg$*q*) is one of the propositions in *R(c*). He need not know that\nClarke know this, or that Clarke could have known this, or really\nanything else. As long as he knows that Clarke made this utterance, it\nseems acceptable for him to agree with it using any of the above\nformulations.\n\nThere are two ways that the indexical contextualist might try to explain\nthis agreement. First, they could try to argue that it is acceptable for\nRebus to agree with Clarke's utterance despite not agreeing with the\npropositional content of it. Second, they could try to argue that it is\nthe case, in any case fitting the above description, that he agrees with\nthe propositional content of what Clarke said.\n\nThe first approach does not seem particularly attractive. Not only does\nit seem theoretically implausible, it is hard to find independent reason\nto believe that this is how agreement works. Generally if a speaker\nutters some term with a contextually sensitive term in it, then another\nspeaker will not agree with the utterance unless they agree with the\nproposition we get by filling in the appropriate value for the\ncontextually sensitive term. Or, perhaps more precisely, they will not\naccept all five of above forms of agreement.\n\nThis is how agreement works when the utterance contains an explicit\nindexical like 'I'. Note that if Clarke had said \"I like Hibs\", Rebus\ncould say \"I agree\" if he too likes Hibs. But he couldn't have said, for\ninstance, \"What she said is true\" unless Clarke liked Hibs. This is why\nthe variety of forms of agreement matters. Perhaps more contentiously, I\nthink this is also what happens when the original utterance involves\nquantifiers with tacit domain restriction, or comparative adjectives\nwith tacit comparison classes, or modals, or any other kind of context\nsensitive language. So the indexical contextualist should look at a\nsecond option.\n\nThe second option is to say that the proposition Rebus knows, $\\neg$(*p*\n& $\\neg$*q*), will be one of the *R(c*). There are two ways to do this.\nFirst, we could say that *R(c*) includes all propositions that are known\nby anyone, so as long as Rebus knows $\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*), it is one\nof the *R(c*). But this just about reduces back to the material\nimplication theory of indicatives, since any conditional will be true as\nlong as anyone knows the corresponding material implication. And that is\nimplausible. Second, we could say that *R(c*) includes any proposition\nknown by anyone who hears *c*'s utterance. That would again ensure that\n$\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*) is one of the *R(c*). But again, it is fairly\nimplausible. For one thing, it doesn't *seem* that the truth of the\nconditionals I'm writing in this paper depend on how wide a readership\nthe paper has. For another, under some assumptions this again collapses\ninto the material implication theory. Assume that there is an omniscient\ndeity. Then for any conditional *If p*, *q*, the deity's knowledge is\namong *R(c*), and if $\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*) is true, then it is one of\nthe *R(c*). But then *If p*, *q* will be true, which was not what we\nwanted. Now we don't know that there is an omniscient deity, but it\nseems reasonable to require that our semantic theories be at least\nconsistent with the existence of such a deity.\n\nSo I think the indexical contextualist has no explanation of this\nagreement phenomena. But the indexical relativist has no such problem.\nWhen Clarke's utterance is being judged by Rebus, it expresses the\nproposition C(*p*, *q*, *R(*Rebus)), so $\\neg$(*p* & $\\neg$*q*) is\nclearly one of the propositions in the third clause. That's why\nagreement with another's utterance of a conditional is so easy.\n\nSimilarly there is no problem for a non-indexical relativist. It is a\nlittle trickier to know whether there is a problem here for the\nnon-indexical contextualist. It is easy to see why many of the locutions\nRebus could use are acceptable. Rebus does, after all, accept the\nproposition that Clarke expresses, namely C(*p*, *q*). The only\ncomplication concerns \"She spoke truly.\" There is a sense in which\nthat's not really true. After all, the non-indexical contextualist\nthinks that Clarke's *utterance* was false, since they think that an\nutterance is true iff the proposition it expresses is true in its\ncontext. If we think, as probably isn't compulsory, that \"She spoke\ntruly\" means what the theorist means by saying the utterance is true,\nthen there is a problem for the non-indexical contextualist.\n\nSetting aside those complications, what is clear is that the phenomena\nof agreement raises a problem for the indexical contextualist, and not\nfor the relativist. We can put the problem another way. If indexical\ncontextualism is true, it should be possible for Rebus to say \"Clarke's\nutterance \"If the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did\" was not true, but\nif the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did.\" Again, this seems like it\nshould be possible on theoretical grounds, and it is possible for most\ncontextually sensitive sentences. But this doesn't seem to be a coherent\nspeech on Rebus's part. This is of course just another manifestation of\nthe phenomena that agreement with conditionals is easy. If Rebus accepts\nthat if the doctor didn't do it, the lawyer did, then he accepts that\nClarke's utterance was true. The indexical contextualist can't explain\nthis, so indexical contextualism is false.\n\n### Against Non-Indexicalism\n\nThe argument for an indexicalist account of indicatives is that they\nallow an elegant account of what is going on in apparent counterexamples\nto modus ponens, such as the cases due to Vann @McGee1985. What these\ncases turn on is that right-embedded conditionals, like *If p, then if\nq, r* seem equivalent, in some sense, to conditional with conjunctive\nantecedents, in this case *If p and q*, *r*. Given this equivalence, and\nthe triviality of *If p and q, p and q*, we get the result that (7.1) is\ntrivial.\n\n1.  If *p*, then if *q*, *p* and *q*\n\nAnd if (7.1) is genuinely trivial, then a number of awkward consequences\nfollow. Perhaps the worst of these consequences is that we seem to get\ncounterexamples to modus ponens. Let *p* be some truth that isn't\nknowable. Since (7.1) is trivial, it is true. And by hypothesis *p* is\ntrue. But on pretty much any epistemic theory of conditionals, *If q*,\n*p and q* will not be true. So we have counterexamples to modus ponens.\n(This is more like McGee's 'lungfish' example than the more widely cited\nexample about the 1980 election, but the structure I think is basically\nthe same, and the solution I offer will generalise to all these cases.)\n\nWhat I'm going to say about these cases borrows heavily from some\nremarks by Anthony @Gillies2009-GILOTF. Gillies makes two observations\nthat point towards a solution to the puzzle McGee's cases raise.\n\nFirst, we cannot in general *assert* both of the premises, namely (7.1)\nand *p*, in contexts where the conclusion, namely *If q*, *p and q* is\nnot assertable. This might need to be qualified in cases where people\ndon't know what they can assert, but it is largely right. As Gillies\ndemonstrates by close attention to the cases, some kind of context shift\nbetween the premises and conclusion is needed in order to assert the\nconclusion after the premises have been asserted.\n\nSecond, there are many reasons to believe that part of what why (7.1)\nseems trivial is that we evaluate its consequent relative to a context\nin which *p* is taken to be part of the evidence. Gillies formalises\nthis by having the antecedent play two separate roles, first as a\nconstituent of the conditional uttered, and second as a context-modifier\nrelative to which the consequent is interpreted. The formal theory I'm\nbuilding here is quite different to Gillies' because of very different\nstarting assumptions, but I will adopt Gillies' idea to the framework\nI'm using.\n\nDespite Gillies' first observation, there are still three reasons to\ntake seriously the challenge McGee's cases raise. Two of these involve\nusing modus ponens under the scope of a supposition, and the third\ninvolves agents who don't know what they know. The first problem\nconcerns the following implication.\n\n  -------- ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------\n     \\(1\\) If *p*, if *q*, *p* and *q*                            Premise\n     \\(2\\) If $\\neg$*p*, if *q*, $\\neg$*p* and *q*                Premise\n     \\(3\\) *p* or $\\neg$*p*                                       Logical truth\n     \\(4\\) *p*                                                    Assumption for argument by cases\n     \\(5\\) If *q*, *p* and *q*                                    Modus Ponens, 1, 4\n     \\(6\\) (If *q*, *p* and *q*) or (If *q*, $\\neg$*p* and *q*)   Or introduction, 5\n     \\(7\\) $\\neg$*p*                                              Assumption for argument by cases\n     \\(8\\) If *q*, $\\neg$*p* and *q*                              Modus Ponens, 2, 7\n     \\(9\\) (If *q*, *p* and *q*) or (If *q*, $\\neg$*p* and *q*)   Or introduction, 8\n    \\(10\\) (If *q*, *p* and *q*) or (If *q*, $\\neg$*p* and *q*)   Argument by cases, 3, 4-6, 7-9\n  -------- ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------\n\nBut on the simple epistemic theory we've been using here, (10) will not\nbe true in cases where the truth value of *p* is unknown, even though it\nseems to follow from two trivialities and a logical truth. (I'm assuming\nhere either that classical logic is correct, or that *p* is decidable.)\nNow it might be noted here that on some theories, particularly those\nthat follow @Stalnaker1981 in accepting conditional excluded middle,\n(10) will be true. But even on those Stalnakerian theories, there will\nbe cases where neither disjunct of (10) will be determinately true. And\nwe can rerun a version of this argument, taking as premises that (1),\n(2) and (3) are determinately true, to derive as a conclusion that one\nor other disjunct is determinately true.\n\nThe third reason is similar to the second. We can use modus ponens in\nthe scope of a reductio proof. Or, more colloquially, we can use modus\ntollens. But the following argument does not look to be particularly\ncompelling.\n\n  ------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------------\n    \\(1\\) If *p*, if *q*, *p* and *q*                   Premise\n    \\(2\\) It is not the case that if *q*, *p* and *q*   Premise\n    \\(3\\) Not *p*                                       Modus Tollens, 1, 2\n  ------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------------\n\nIt may be objected that modus tollens is more controversial than modus\nponens. But since we can derive it using just modus ponens and reductio\nad absurdum, this objection looks weak. So this would be a bad result.\n\nIt might be thought best to say here that modus ponens doesn't preserve\ntruth, but it does preserve knowledge. If a subject is in knows each\npremise, they can know the conclusion. But that doesn't seem right\neither, though the cases are slightly obscure. Assume a perfectly\nrational S knows that *p*, but does not know that she knows that *p*,\nand in fact for all she knows she knows, *q* and $\\neg$*p* is true.\nAgain assuming (7.1) is trivial, she knows it, and she knows that *p*,\nbut on an epistemic interpretation of the conditional, she won't know\n*If q*, *p and q*, since she doesn't know she knows that *p*.\n\nSo there is a serious problem here. Once we accept that (7.1) is\ntrivial, a lot of unfortunate consequences follow for the epistemic\ntheory of conditionals. Any explanation of why (7.1) seems trivial will,\nI think, have to start with Gillies' insight that when we interpret\n(7.1), we evaluate its consequent relative to a context where *p* is\ntaken as given. How might we do this? Three options spring to mind.\n\nThe first option is Gillies' theory is that it is part of the meaning of\nthe conditional that its consequent be interpreted relative to a context\nwhere its antecedent is part of the background information. That has the\nnice result that (7.1) is indeed trivial. It seems, however, to lead to\nall the problems mentioned above. Gillies' response to these is to\ndevelop a new theory of validity, which has the effect that while modus\nponens is itself valid, it can't be used inside the scope of\nsuppositions, as I frequently did above. This is a very interesting\ntheory, and it may well work out, but I'm going to try to develop a more\nconservative approach.\n\nThe second option is to say that just uttering a conditional, *If A, B*,\nadds *A* to the background information. This seems like a bad option.\nFor one thing, there is no independent reason to believe that this is\ntrue. For another, it can't explain what is wrong with the following\nkind of argument.\n\n1.  Burns knows that if *p*, then if *q*, *p* and *q*\n\n2.  Burns knows that it is not the case that if *q*, *p* and *q*\n\n3.  Burns is logically perfect, and knows the logical consequences of\n    everything he knows\n\n4.  So, Burns knows not *p*\n\nIn a case where Burns doesn't know whether *p* is true, and Burns is\nindeed logically perfect, then intuitively (1), (2) and (3) are true,\nbut (4) are false. And since no conditionals were asserted, it is hard\nto see how the context was shifted.\n\nThe third, and best, option is to say that the variable in the semantics\nof an embedded conditional is partially bound to the antecedent.\nNormally when we say *If q*, *p and q*, the content of that is C(*q*,\n*p* and *q*, X), and normally X is *R(*PRO~J~). The view under\nconsideration says that when that conditional is itself the consequent\nof a conditional, the variable X is partially bound to the antecedent of\nthe conditional. So the value of X is *p* plus whatever is supplied by\ncontext.\n\nThe contextualist says that that value is *R(i*), where *i* is usually\nthe speaker. So the semantic content of (7.1) is C(*p*, C(*q*, *p* and\n*q*, *p* + *R(i*)), *R(i*)). And that will be trivial since the middle\nterm is trivial. The relativist says that the contribution of context to\nX is *R(*PRO~J~). So the semantic content of (7.1) is C(*p*, C(*q*, *p*\nand *q*, *p* + *R(*PRO~J~)), *R(*PRO~J~)). And again, that is trivial.\n\nThis gives us a natural explanation of what is going on in the McGee\ncases. There is simply an equivocation between premise and conclusion in\nall of the cases. What follows from C(*p*, C(*q*, *p* and *q*, *p* +\n*R(x*)), *R(x*)) and *p* is C(*q*, *p* and *q*, *p* + *R(x*)). But\nthat's not what we normally express by *If q*, *p and q*. At least, it\nisn't what we express once we've made it clear that *p* is not part of\nthe background information. (Here is where Gillies' observation that the\nMcGee cases seem to require a context shift between stating the premises\nand stating the conclusion becomes relevant.) So although modus ponens\nis valid, the McGee cases are simply not instances of modus ponens,\nsince there is an equivocation in the value of a tacit variable.\n\nIt might be argued that this is too much of a concession to McGee. Some\npeople have the judgment that (7.1) is not always trivial, in particular\nthat conditionals *If A*, *then if B*, *A* are not always trivially\ntrue. Personally I don't get these readings, but I note that the theory\nallows for their possibility. After all, binding need not be compulsory.\nWe can interpret the 'she' in *If Suzy enters the race*, *she will win*\ndeictically, if that's what makes the best sense in the context. Perhaps\nin cases where people are hearing the false readings of *If A*, *then if\nB*, *A*, all that is going on is that the tacit indexical in the\nembedded conditional is unbound. Similarly, if one's reaction to seeing\nthe McGee arguments is to interpret the embedded conditionals as false,\nI suspect what is going on is that one is hearing the variables here as\nunbound. As I said, I don't get these readings, but I can explain where\nthese readings come from.\n\nThe story I'm telling about the McGee cases is hardly new. Indeed, the\nview that the McGee cases are not strictly speaking instances of Modus\nPonens is old enough to have been disparaged by William Lycan in his\nattacks on Modus Ponens.\n\n> But this very strict sense of 'instance' is neither specific nor\n> intended in logic textbooks \\... What students and professional\n> philosophers have always been told is that barring equivocation or\n> overt indexicals, arguments of the sentential form If A, B; A;\n> therefore, B are valid arguments, period \\... One can continue to\n> insist that Modus Ponens is valid for the strict sense of 'instance',\n> but at the price of keeping us from telling easily and\n> uncontroversially when a set of ordinary English sentences is an\n> 'instance' of an argument form. [@Lycan1993 424, notation slightly\n> altered]\n\nBut why should we give any privilege to *overt* indexicals? Tacit\nvariables can be just as important in determining which form an argument\ntakes. For example, the following argument is, on the most natural\ninterpretation of each sentence, invalid.\n\n1.  No foreigner speaks a foreign language.\n\n2.  Ségolinè is a foreigner.\n\n3.  French is a foreign language.\n\n4.  Ségolinè does not speak French.\n\nThat is invalid on its most natural reading because the tacit variable\nattached to 'foreign' in premises 1 and 3 takes a different value. No\none would reasonably say that we should rewrite the logic books so the\nargument form *No F Rs a G*; *Fa*; *Gb*; so $\\neg$*Rab* is not valid on\nthis account. Lycan is right about the downside of this point. There is\nno way to tell easily and uncontroversially what the form of an argument\nin natural language is. But we should never have believed such careful\nmatters of interpretation would be easy. (They say life wasn't meant to\nbe.)\n\nHaving said that, on the indexical relativist proposal offered here, it\nisn't *that* hard to tell what the value of X in a typical indicative\nis. It is usually *R(*PRO~J~), and there might be a very short list of\ncircumstances where it takes any other value. Any indexical account\nfaces a potential cost that it makes interpretation more difficult than\nit might otherwise be, since the hearer has to determine the value for\nthe indexical. The fact that X is usually *R(*PRO~J~) minimises that\ncost. What is new to my proposal is that X might be partially bound in\nthe McGee cases. But that only helps the interpretative task, since it\nreduces the task to a familiar problem interpreters face when the\nspeaker uses a partially bound plural pronoun.\n\nBut the primary point of this proposal is not to offer a new solution to\nthe McGee cases. Rather it is to note one of the requirements of this\nkind of (relatively familiar) solution. An equivocation solution\nrequires that there be something in the semantic content of the\nconditional that takes different values in the consequent of premise 1\nand in the conclusion. And non-indexical theories, by definition, can't\nsay that there is any such thing. For the whole point of such theories\nis to deny that the content of a conditional is always different in\ncontexts with different information sets. So they cannot say the McGee\narguments (or the other arguments I surveyed above that use Modus Ponens\nin embedded contexts) involve equivocation. But then it is hard to say\nwhat is wrong with those arguments. So these theories seem, implausibly,\nto be committed to denials of Modus Ponens. That's a sufficient reason,\nI think, to be an indexicalist.\n\nLet's take stock. In section 6 I argued that the indexical contextualist\nhas no explanation of why it is so easy to *agree* with another's\nutterance of a conditional. In this section I argued that only the\nindexicalist can offer a satisfactory explanation of what is going on in\nthe McGee argument. The upshot of these two arguments is that we should\nbe indexical relativists. For only the indexical relativist can (a)\nexplain the agreement data and (b) explain what goes wrong in the McGee\narguments.\n\nAs a small coda, let me mention one other benefit of the partial binding\naccount. When I presented an earlier version of this paper at the LOGOS\nworkshop on Relativising Utterance Truth, the following objection was\npressed to the argument in section 1 for an epistemic treatment of\nindicatives. It is true that when we know that *f*(*a*) = *f*(*b*), then\nwe are prepared to assert *If f*(*a*) = *x*, *then f*(*b*) = *x*. But it\nis also true that when we merely suppose that *f*(*a*) = *f*(*b*), then\nwe are prepared to infer inside the scope of the supposition that *If\nf*(*a*) = *x*, *then f*(*b*) = *x*. The epistemic account cannot\nsatisfactorily explain this. At the time I didn't know how to adequately\nexplain these intuitions, but now it seems the partial binding story can\ndo the work. It seems that inside the scope of a supposition that *p*,\nthe value of X is *p* + Y, where Y is the value X would otherwise have\nhad. That is, the variable in the conditional is partially bound to the\nsupposition that governs the discourse. That explains why all the\ninferences mentioned in section one are acceptable, even when the\npremise is merely a supposition.\n\n### Coda: Methodological Ruminations {#coda-methodological-ruminations .unnumbered}\n\nThe version of relativism defended here is conservative in a number of\nrespects. Three stand out.\n\nFirst, it is conservative about what propositions are. The propositions\nthat are the content of open indicatives (relative to contexts of\nassessment) are true or false relative to worlds, not to judges, or\nepistemic states, or anything of the sort.\n\nSecond, it is (somewhat) conservative about how the sentences get to\nhave those propositions as content. The standing meaning of the sentence\ncontains a variable place that gets filled by context. To be sure, it is\na plural variable that can be partially bound, but there is independent\nevidence that plural variables can be partially bound. And of course,\nand this is a radical step, its value can be different for different\nassessors of the one utterance. But from the indexical relativist\nperspective, the contextualist theory that values for variables are set\nby contexts of utterance is an overly hasty generalisation from the\nbehaviour of a few simple indexicals. (It isn't clear even clear that\nthe contextualist theory can account for simple pronouns, like 'you' or\n'now' as they appear in sentences like the one you are now reading, so\nthis generalisation might have been very poorly motivated in the first\nplace.)\n\nThird, it is conservative about the motivation for relativism. I haven't\nrelied on intuitions about faultless disagreement, which is an\ninherently controversial topic. Rather, I've argued that we can motivate\nrelativism well enough by just looking at the grounds on which people\n*agree* with earlier utterances. I think there is a general\nmethodological point here; most of the time when theorists try to\nmotivate relativism using cases of disagreement, they could derive most\nof their conclusions from careful studies of cases of agreement. This\nmethod won't *always* work; I don't think you can replicate the\ndisagreement-based arguments for moral relativism with arguments from\nagreement for example. But I think that is a weakness with moral\nrelativism, rather than a weakness with the methodology of focussing on\nagreement rather than disagreement with arguing for relativism.\n\nNow one shouldn't fetishise epistemic conservativeness. But a relativism\nthat requires less of a revision of our worldview should be more\nplausible to a wider range of people than a more radical relativist\nview. And that's what I've provided with the indexical relativist theory\ndefended here.\n\n[^1]: It is actually a little tricky to say just what the relevant types\n    are. I mean to use the term so that two people make an utterance of\n    the same type if their utterances use the same words, with the same\n    syntax, and the same elided material, and the same meaning. So two\n    utterances of \"I am Australian\" could be of the same type, even if\n    offered by different people. In some cases, e.g. \"Steel is strong\n    enough\", it might be controversial whether two utterances that\n    intuitively have different contents are either (a) of the same type,\n    or (b) use terms with different meanings, or (c) have different\n    elided material. I'll try to stay neutral on this point.\n\n[^2]: I don't mean to suggest that these are the *only* options. I'm\n    leaving off options on which there are contextual effects on\n    semantic content that are not syntactically triggered, for example.\n    My reason for doing that is that there are, I think, good reasons\n    for thinking that the context-sensitivity of indicative conditionals\n    *is* syntactically triggered, so I don't need to investigate\n    non-syntactic triggers here.\n\n[^3]: I'm assuming throughout that it is sufficient for the truth of\n    C(*p*, *q*, X) that it is a priori that *p* plus X entail *q*. I\n    also think that's necessary, but I won't lean on this assumption.\n\n[^4]: The move I'm about to make bears at least a family resemblance to\n    some moves @LopezDeSa2008b makes in defending what he calls\n    'indexical relativism', though he means something different by that\n    phrase.\n\n[^5]: I thought this was a way in which plural pronouns were unlike\n    singular pronouns, but Zoltán Szabó suggested persuasively that\n    singular pronouns could also be partially bound in the sense\n    described below. The interesting cases concern pronouns that seem to\n    refer to objects made from multiple parts, with circumstances of\n    utterance determining some parts of the referent, and the other\n    parts being the denotata of the terms to which the pronoun is\n    partially bound. I'm not going to take a stand on whether such\n    pronouns exist, but if Szabó's suggestion is correct, then the need\n    to take X to be a plural variable is lessened.\n\n[^6]: This response is similar to some of the arguments for speech act\n    pluralism in @Cappelen2005.\n",
