Not because the\nold theories are useless. Quite the contrary, the old theories provide\nmany of the materials we need to construct the truest theory of\nvagueness ever seen. The theory shall be similar in motivation to\nsupervaluationism, but more akin to many-valued theories in\nconceptualisation. What I take from the many-valued theories is the idea\nthat some sentences can be *truer* than others. But I say very different\nthings to the ordering over sentences this relation generates. I say it\nis not a linear ordering, so it cannot be represented by the real\nnumbers. I also argue that since there is higher-order vagueness, any\nmapping between sentences and mathematical objects is bound to be\ninappropriate. This is no cause for regret; we can say all we want to\nsay by using the comparative *truer than* without mapping it onto some\nmathematical objects. From supervaluationism I take the idea that we can\nkeep classical logic without keeping the familiar bivalent semantics for\nclassical logic. But my preservation of classical logic is more\ncomprehensive than is normally permitted by supervaluationism, for I\npreserve classical inference rules as well as classical sequents. And I\ndo this without relying on the concept of acceptable precisifications as\nan unexplained explainer.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophical Studies_ 123: 47-70.\n\nThanks to Juan Comesaña, John Hawthorne, Allan Hazlett, Alyssa Ney, and audiences at the 2002 APA Central, the University of Edinburgh and especially the 2003 BSPC for helpful comments. From the latter I’m especially grateful to Jonathan Bennett, Alex Byrne, Cian Dorr, Andy Egan, Elizabeth Harman, Robin Jeshion, Mike Nelson, Jonathan Schaffer, Ted Sider and Gabriel Uzquiano. I’m also grateful to two very helpful referee reports and to Restall (2000), without which I would never have known enough about lattices to write this paper.\n</aside>\n\nThe world does not need another guide to varieties of theories of\nvagueness, especially since Timothy @Williamson1994-WILV and Rosanna\n@Keefe2000 have already provided quite good guides. I assume throughout\nfamiliarity with popular theories of vagueness.\n\n### Truer\n\nThe core of my theory is that some sentences involving vague terms are\ntruer than others. I won't give an analysis of *truer*, instead I will\nargue that we already tacitly understand this relation. The main\nargument for this will turn on a consideration of two 'many-valued'\ntheories of vagueness, one of which will play a central role (as the\nprimary villain) in what follows.\n\nThe most familiar many-valued theory, call it $M$, says there are\ncontinuum many truth values, and they can be felicitously represented by\nthe interval $[0,~1]$. The four main logical connectives: *and*, *or*,\n*if* and *not* are truth-functional. The functions are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nV(A \\wedge B) &= min(V(A), V(B))   \\\\\nV(A \\vee B) &= max(V(A), V(B))   \\\\\nV(A \\rightarrow B) &= max(1, 1 - V(A) + V(B)) \\\\\nV(\\neg A) &= 1 - V(A)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere $V$ is the valuation function on sentences, $min(x, y)$ is the\nsmaller of $x$ and *y* and $max(x, y)$ is the larger of $x$ and *y*.\n\nAdopting these rules for the connectives commits us to adopting the\nlogic Ł~C~. $M$ is the theory that this semantic model, under its most\nnatural interpretation, is appropriate for vague natural languages.\n(We'll discuss less natural interpretations presently.)\n\n$M$ tells a particularly nice story about the Sorites. A premise like\n*If she's rich, someone with just a little less money is also rich* will\nhave a very high truth value. If we make the difference in money between\nthe two subjects small enough, this conditional will have a truth value\narbitrarily close to 1.\n\n$M$ also tells a nice story about borderline cases and determinateness.\nAn object $a$ is a borderline case of being an $F$ just in case the\nsentence *a is F* has a truth value between 0 and 1 exclusive.\nSimilarly, $a$ is a determinate $F$ just in case the truth value of *a\nis F* is 1. (It is worthwhile comparing how simple this analysis of\ndeterminateness is to the difficulties supervaluationists have in\nproviding an analysis of determinateness. On this topic, see\n@Williamson1995, @McGee1998 and @Williamson2004-WILRTM.)\n\nBut $M$ tells a particularly implausible story about contradictions.\nHere is how Timothy @Williamson1994-WILV makes this problem vivid.\n\n> More disturbing is that the law of non-contradiction fails ....\n> $\\neg(p \\wedge \\neg p)$ always has the same degree of truth as\n> $p \\vee \\neg p$, and thus is perfectly true only when $p$ is either\n> perfectly true or perfectly false. When $p$ is half-true, so are both\n> $p \\wedge \\neg p$ and $\\neg(p \\wedge \\neg p)$. [@Williamson1994-WILV\n> 118]\n>\n> At some point [in waking up] 'He is awake' is supposed to be\n> half-true, so 'He is not awake' will be half-true too. Then 'He is\n> awake and he is not awake' will count as half-true. How can an\n> explicit contradiction be true to any degree other than 0?\n> [@Williamson1994-WILV 136]\n\nThere is a way to keep the semantic engine behind $M$ while avoiding\nthis consequence. (The following few paragraphs are indebted pretty\nheavily to the criticisms of Strawson's theory of descriptions in\n@Dummett1959)\n\nConsider an interpretation of the above semantics on which there are\nonly two truth values: True and False. Any sentence that gets truth\nvalue 1 is true, all the others are false. The numbers in [0, 1)\nrepresent different ways of being false. (As Tolstoy might have put it,\nall true sentences are alike, but every false sentence is false in its\nown unique way.) Which way a sentence is false can affect the truth\nvalue of compounds containing that sentence. In particular, if $A$ and\n$B$ are false, then the truth values of *Not A* and *If A then B* will\ndepend on the ways $A$ and $B$ take their truth values. If $V$($A$) = 0\nand $V$($B$) = 0.3, then *Not A* and *If A then B* will be true, but if\n$V$($A$) becomes 0.6, and remember this is just another way of being\nfalse, both *Not A* and *If A then B* will be false.\n\nThe new theory we get, one I'll call $M_D$, is similar to $M$ in some\nrespects. For example, it agrees about what the axioms should be for a\nlogic for natural language. But it has several philosophical\ndifferences. In particular, it has none of the three characteristics of\n$M$ we noted above.\n\nIt cannot tell as plausible story as $M$ does about the Sorites. If any\nsentence with truth value below 1 is false, then many of the premises in\na Sorites argument are *false*. This is terrible -- it was bad enough to\nbe told that one of the premises were false, but now we find many\nthousands of them are false. I doubt that being told they are false in a\ndistinctive way will improve our estimation of the theory. Similarly, it\nis hard to see just how the new theory has anything interesting to say\nabout the concept of a borderline case.\n\nOn the other hand, according to $M_D$, contradictions are always false.\nTo be sure, a contradiction might be false in some obscure new way, but\nit is still false. Recall Williamson's objection that an explicit\ncontradiction should be true to degree 0 and nothing more. This\nobjection only works if being true to degree 0.5 is meant to be\nsemantically significant. If being 'true to degree 0.5' is just another\nway of being false, then there is presumably nothing wrong with\ncontradictions are true to degree 0.5. This is not to say Williamson's\nobjection is no good, since he intended it as an objection to $M$, but\njust to say that re-interpreting the semantic significance of the\nnumbers in $M$ makes a philosophical difference.\n\nDespite $M_D$'s preferable treatment of contradictions, I think $M$ is\noverall a better theory because it has a much better account of\nborderline cases. But for now I want to stress a simpler point: $M$ and\n$M_D$ are *different* theories of vagueness, and that we grasp the\ndifference between these theories. One crucial difference between the\ntwo theories is that in $M$, but not $M_D$, $S_1$is truer than $S_2$ if\n$V$($S_1$) is greater than $V$($S_2$). In $M_D$, if $S_1$is truer than\n$S_2$, $V$($S_1$) must be one and $V$($S_2$) less than one. And that is\nthe *only* difference between the two theories. So if we understand this\ndifference, we must grasp this concept *truer than*. Indeed, it is in\nvirtue of grasping this concept that we understand why saying each of\nthe Sorites conditionals is almost true is a *prima facie* plausible\nresponse to the Sorites, and why having a theory that implies\ncontradictions are truer than many other sentences is a rather\nembarrassing thing.\n\nI have implicitly defined *truer* by noting its theoretical role. As\nDavid @Lewis1972a showed, terms can be implicitly defined by their\ntheoretical role. There is one unfortunate twist here in that *truer* is\ndefined by its role in a *false* theory, but that does not block the\nimplicit definition story. We know what *phlogiston* and *ether* mean\nbecause of their role in some false theories. The meaning of *truer* can\nbe extracted in the same way from the false theory $M$.\n\n### Further Reflections on *Truer*\n\nAs noted, I won't give a reductive analysis of *truer*. The hopes for\ndoing that are no better than the hopes of giving a reductive analysis\nof *true*. But I will show that we pre-theoretically understand the\nconcept.\n\nMy primary argument for this has already been given. Intuitively we do\nunderstand the difference between $M$ and its $M_D$, and this is only\nexplicable by our understanding *truer*. Hence we understand *truer*.\n\nSecond, it's noteworthy that *truer* is morphologically complex. If we\nunderstand *true*, and understand the modifier -*er*, then we know\nenough in principle to know how they combine. Not every predicate can be\nturned into a comparative. But most can, and our default assumption\nshould be that *true* is like the majority.\n\nI have heard two arguments against that assumption. First, it could be\nargued that most comparatives in English generate linear orderings, but\n*truer* generates a non-linear ordering. I reject the premise of this\nargument. *Cuter*, *Smarter*, *Smellier*, and *Tougher* all generate\nnon-linear orderings over their respective domains, and they seem fairly\nindicative of large classes. Second, it could be argued that it's\ncrucial to understanding comparatives that we understand the interaction\nof the underlying adjectives with comparison classes. Robin Jeshion and\nMike Nelson made this objection in their comments on my paper at BSPC\n2003. Again, the premise is not obviously true. We can talk about some\nobjects being *straighter* or *rounder* despite the fact that it's hard\nto understand *round for an office building* or *straight for a line\ndrive*. (Jonathan Bennett made this point in discussion at BSPC.)\n*Straight* and *round* either don't have or don't need comparison\nclasses, but they form comparatives. So *true*, which also does not take\ncomparison classes, could also form a comparative.\n\nFinally, if understanding the inferential role of a logical operator\nhelps know its meaning, then it is notable that *truer* has a very clear\ninferential role. It is the same as a strict material implication\n$\\square (q \\supset p)$ defined using a necessity operator whose logic\nis KT. Since many operators have just this logic, this doesn't\nindividuate *truer*, but it helps with inferential role semantics\naficionados.\n\nI claim that the concept *truer*, and the associated concept *as true\nas*, are the only theoretical tools we need to provide a complete theory\nof vagueness. It is simplest to state the important features of my\ntheory by contrasting it with $M$. I keep the following good features of\n$M$.\n\nG1\n\n:   There are *intermediate* sentences, i.e. sentences that are truer\n    than some sentences and less true than others. For definiteness, I\n    will say $S$ is intermediate iff $S$ is truer than 0=1 and less true\n    than 0=0.\n\nG2\n\n:   $a$ is a borderline $F$ iff *a is F* is intermediate, and $a$ is\n    determinately $F$ iff $a$ is $F$ and $a$ is not a borderline $F$.\n\nI won't repeat the arguments here, but I take G1 to be a large advantage\nof theories like $M$ over epistemicist theories. (See @Burgess2001,\n@Sider2001 and @Weatherson2003-WEAEPA for more detailed arguments to\nthis effect.) And as noted G2 is a much simpler analysis of determinacy\nand borderline than supervaluationists have been able to offer.\n\nI drop the following bad features of $M$.\n\nB1 *Some contradictions are intermediate sentences*.\n\n:   \\\n    On my theory all contradictions are determinately false, and\n    determinately determinately false, and so on. The argument for this\n    has been given above.\n\nB2 *Some classical tautologies are intermediate sentences*.\n\n:   \\\n    On my theory all classical tautologies are determinately true, and\n    determinately determinately true, and so on. We will note three\n    arguments for this being an improvement in the next section.\n\nB3 *Some classical inference rules are inadmissible*.\n\n:   \\\n    On my theory all classical inference rules are admissible. As\n    @Williamson1994-WILV showed, the most prominent version of\n    supervaluationism is like $M$ in ruling some classical rules to be\n    inadmissible, and this is clearly a cost of those theories.\n\nB4 *Sentences of the form* S is intermediate *are never intermediate*\n\n:   \\\n    I will argue below this is a consequence of $M$, and it means it is\n    impossible to provide a plausible theory of higher-order vagueness\n    within $M$. In my theory we can say that there is higher-order\n    vagueness by treating *truer* as an iterable operator, so we can say\n    that *S is intermediate* is intermediate. If $S$ is *a is F*, that's\n    equivalent to saying that $a$ is a borderline case of a borderline\n    case of an $F$. Essentially we get out theory of higher-order\n    vagueness by simply iterating our theory of first-order vagueness,\n    which is what Williamson does in his justly celebrated treatment of\n    higher-order vagueness. Note it's not just $M$ that has troubles\n    with higher-order vagueness. See @Williamson1994-WILV and\n    @Weatherson2003-Keefe for the difficulties supervaluationists have\n    with higher-order vagueness. The treatment of higher-order vagueness\n    here is a substantial advantage of my theory over supervaluationism.\n\nB5 *Truer is a linear relation*.\n\n:   \\\n    On my theory it need not be the case that $S_1$is truer than $S_2$,\n    or $S_2$ is truer than $S_1$, or they are as true as each other. In\n    the last section I will argue that this is a substantial advantage\n    of my theory. I claim that *truer* generates a Boolean lattice on\n    possible sentences of the language. (For a familiar example of a\n    Boolean lattice, think of the subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ ordered by the\n    subset relation.)\n\nI also provide a very different, and much more general, treatment of the\nSorites than is available within $M$. The biggest technical difference\nbetween my theory and $M$ concerns the relationship between the\nsemantics and the logic. In $M$ the logic falls out from the\ntruth-tables. Since I do not have the concept of an intermediate truth\nvalue in my theory, I could not provide anything like a truth-table.\nInstead I posit several constraints on the interaction of *truer* with\nfamiliar connectives, posit an analysis of validity in terms of *truer*,\nand note that those two posits imply that all and only classically\nadmissible inference rules are admissible.\n\n### Constraints on Truer and Classical Logic\n\nThe following ten constraints on *truer* seem intuitively compelling.\nI've listed here both the philosophically important informal claim, and\nthe formal interpretation of that claim. (I use $A \\geqslant _T B$ as\nshorthand for $A$ *is at least as* *true as B*. Note all the quantifiers\nover sentences here are *possibilist* quantifiers, we quantify over all\npossible sentences in the language.)\n\n(A1)\n\n:   $\\geqslant _T$ is a weak ordering (i.e. reflexive and transitive)\\\n    If $A \\geqslant _T B$ and $B \\geqslant _T C$ then\n    $A \\geqslant _T C$\\\n    $A \\geqslant _T A$\n\n(A2)\n\n:   $\\wedge$ is a greatest lower bound with respect to $\\geqslant _T$\\\n    $A \\wedge B \\geqslant _T C$ iff $A \\geqslant _T C$ and\n    $B \\geqslant _T C$\\\n    $C \\geqslant _T$ *A*$\\wedge B$ iff for all $S$ such that\n    $A \\geqslant _T S$ and $B \\geqslant _T$*S* it is also the case that\n    $C \\geqslant _T S$\n\n(A3)\n\n:   $\\vee$ is a least upper bound with respect to $\\geqslant _T$\\\n    $A \\vee B \\geqslant _T C$ iff for all $S$ such that\n    $S \\geqslant _T A$ and $S \\geqslant _T B$, it is also the case that\n    $S \\geqslant _T C$\\\n    $C \\geqslant _T$ *A*$\\vee B$ iff $C \\geqslant _T A$ and\n    $B \\geqslant _T C$\n\n(A4)\n\n:   $\\neg$ is ordering inverting with respect to $\\geqslant _T$\\\n    $A \\geqslant _T B$ iff $\\neg B \\geqslant _T \\neg A$\n\n(A5)\n\n:   Double negation is redundant\\\n    $\\neg \\neg A =_T A$\n\n(A6)\n\n:   There is an absolutely false sentence $S_F$ and an absolutely true\n    sentence $S_T$\\\n    There are sentences $S_F$and $S_T$such that $S_F =_T \\neg S_T$ and\n    $\\neg S_F =_T S_T$  and for all $S$:\n    $S_T \\geqslant _T S \\geqslant _T S_F$\n\n(A7)\n\n:   Contradictions are absolutely false\\\n    $A \\wedge \\neg A =_T S_F$\n\n(A8)\n\n:   $\\forall$ is a greatest lower bound with respect to $\\geqslant _T$\\\n    $A \\geqslant _T \\forall x$($\\phi x$) iff for all $S$ such that for\n    all $o$, if $n$ is a name of $o$ then $\\phi n \\geqslant _T S$, it is\n    the case that $A \\geqslant _T S$\\\n    $\\forall x$($\\phi x$) $\\geqslant _T A$ iff for all $o$, if $n$ is a\n    name of $o$ then $\\phi n \\geqslant _T A$\n\n(A9)\n\n:   $\\exists$ is a least upper bound with respect to $\\geqslant _T$\\\n    $A \\geqslant _T \\exists x$($\\phi x$) iff for all $o$, if $n$ is a\n    name of $o$ then\n    $A \\geqslant _T \\phi$*n*$\\exists x$($\\phi x$) $\\geqslant _T A$ iff\n    for all $S$ such that for all $o$, if $n$ is a name of $o$ then\n    $S \\geqslant _T \\phi n$, $S \\geqslant _T A$\n\n(A10)\n\n:   A material implication with respect to $\\geqslant _T$ can be\n    defined.\\\n    There is an operative $\\rightarrow$ such that\n\n    1.  $B \\rightarrow A \\geqslant _T S_T$iff $A \\geqslant _T B$\n\n    2.  ($A \\wedge B$)$\\rightarrow C =_T A  \\rightarrow$($B \\rightarrow C$)\n\nApart from (A10) these are fairly straightforward. We can't argue for\n(A10) by saying English *if...then* is a material implication, because\nthat leads directly to the paradoxes of material implication. Assuming\nthat $\\neg A \\vee B$ is a material implication is equivalent to assuming\n(inter alia) that $A \\vee \\neg A$ is perfectly true. I believe this, but\nsince it is denied by many I want that to be a conclusion, not a\npremise. So the argument for (A10) must be a little indirect. In\nparticular, we will appeal to the behaviour of quantifiers. We can\nformally represent *All Fs are Gs* in two ways: using restricted or\nunrestricted quantifiers. In the first case the formal representation\nwill look like:\n\n> $\\forall x$(*Fx* ? *Gx*)\n\nwith some connective in place of '?'. But it seems clear that whatever\nconnective goes in there must be a material implication. In the second\ncase, the formal representation will look like:\n\n> [$\\forall x$: *Fx*] *Gx*\n\nIn that case, we can define a connective $\\nabla$ that satisfies the\ndefinition of a material implication:\n\n> $A \\nabla B$ =~df~ [$\\forall x$: $A \\wedge x$=$x$]\n> ($B \\wedge x$=$x$)\n\nThis is equivalent to the odd (but intelligible) sentence *Everything\nsuch that A is such that B*. Again, considerations about what should be\nlogical truths involving quantifiers suggests that $\\nabla$ must be a\nmaterial implication. So either way there should be a material\nimplication present in the language, as (A10) says.\n\nGiven (A1) to (A10) it follows that this material implication is\nequivalent to $\\neg A \\vee B$, and hence $A \\vee \\neg A$ is a logical\ntruth. This is a surprising *conclusion*, since intuitively vagueness\nposes problems for excluded middle, but I think it is more plausible\nthat vague instances of excluded middle are problematic for *pragmatic*\nreasons than that any of (A1) to (A10) are false.\n\nWhat is interesting about these ten constraints is that they suffice for\nclassical logic, with just one more supposition. I assume that an\nargument is *valid* iff it is impossible for the premises taken\ncollectively to be truer than the conclusion, i.e. iff it is impossible\nfor the conjunction of the premises to be truer than the conclusion.\nGiven that, we get:\n\n> $\\forall A_1$, ...,$A_n$,$B$: $A_1$, ..., $A_n \\vdash$~T~ $B$ iff,\n> according to classical logic, $A_1$, ..., $A_n$ $\\vdash$ $B$\n\n(I use $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$~T~ $A$ to mean that in all models for\n$\\geqslant _T$ that satisfy the constraints, here (A1) to (A10), the\nconclusion is at least as true as the greatest lower bound of the\npremises.) I won't prove this result, but the idea is that (A1) to (A10)\nimply that $\\geqslant _T$ defines a Boolean lattice over equivalence\nclasses of sentences with respect to $=_T$. And all Boolean lattices are\nmodels for classical logic, from which our result follows. Indeed,\nBoolean lattices are models for classical logic in the strong sense that\nclassical inference rules, such as conditional proof and *reductio*, are\nadmissible in logics defined on them, so we also get the admissibility\nof classical inference rules in this theory. (Note that this result only\nholds in the right-to-left direction for languages that contain the\n$\\geqslant _T$ operator. Once this operator is added, some arguments\nthat are not classically valid, such as $B \\geqslant _T A$,\n$A \\vdash$~T~ $B$, will valid. But the addition of this operator is\nconservative: if we look at the $\\geqslant _T$-free fragment of such\nlanguages, the above result still holds in both directions.)\n\nThere are three reasons for wanting to keep classical logic in a theory\nof vagueness. First, as Williamson has stressed, classical logic is at\nthe heart of many successful research programs. Second, non-classical\ntheories of vagueness tend to abandon too much of classical logic. For\ninstance, $M$ abandons the very plausible schema\n($A \\wedge A \\rightarrow B$)$\\rightarrow B$. The third reason is the one\ngiven here - these ten independently plausible constraints on *truer*\nentail that the logic for a language containing *truer* should be\nclassical. These three arguments add up to a powerful case that\nnon-classical theories like $M$ are mistaken, and we should prefer a\ntheory that preserved classical logic.\n\n### Semantics and Proof Theory\n\nIn this section I will describe a semantics and proof theory for a\nlanguage containing *truer* as an iterable operator. This is important\nfor the theory of higher-order vagueness. I say that $a$ is a borderline\nborderline $F$ just in case the sentence *a is a borderline F* is\nintermediate, where 'borderline' is analysed as in section 2. It might\nnot be obvious that it is consistent with (A1) to (A10) that any\nsentence *a is a borderline F* could be consistent. One virtue of the\nmodel theory outlined here is that it shows this is consistent.\n\nFor comparison, note that $M$ as it stands has no way of dealing with\nhigher-order vagueness, i.e. with borderline cases of borderline cases\nof $F$-ness. If every sentence *a is a borderline F* either does or does\nnot receive an integer truth value, then this intuitive possibility is\nruled out. We cannot solve the problem simply by iterating $M$. (This is\na point stressed by [@Williamson1994-WILV Ch. 4].) We cannot say that it\nis true to degree 0.5 than (2) is true to degree 1, and true to degree\n0.5 that it is true to degree 0.8. For then it is only true to degree\n0.5 that (2) has some truth value or other. And the use of truth-tables\nto generate a logic presupposes that every sentence has some truth\nvalues or other. If this is not determinately true, $M$ is not a\ncomplete theory. So the model theory will show that our theory is\nsubstantially better than $M$ in this respect.\n\nConsider the following (minor) variant on KT. Vary the syntax so\n$\\square A$ is only well-formed if $A$ is of the form $B \\rightarrow C$.\nCall the resulting logic KT~R~, with the R indicating the syntactic\nrestriction. The restriction makes very little difference. Since $A$ is\nequivalent to ($A \\rightarrow A$) $\\rightarrow A$, even if $\\square A$\nis not well-formed in KT~R~, the KT-equivalent sentence\n$\\square$(($A \\rightarrow A$) $\\rightarrow A$) will be well-formed. The\nKripke models for KT~R~ are quite natural. $\\square$($B \\rightarrow C$)\nis true at a point iff all accessible points at which $B$ is true are\npoints at which $C$ is true. (There is no restriction on the\naccessibility relation other than reflexivity.)\n\nSince KT~R~ is so similar to KT, we can derive most of its formal\nproperties by looking at the derivations of similar properties for KT.\n(The next few paragraphs owe a lot to [@Goldblatt1992 Chs.1-3].) Let's\nstart with an axiomatic proof theory. The axioms for KT~R~ are:\n\n-   All classical tautologies\n\n-   All well-formed instances of K:\n    $\\square$($A \\rightarrow B$) $\\rightarrow$ ($\\square A \\rightarrow \\square B$)\n\n-   All well-formed instances of T: $\\square A \\rightarrow A$\n\nThe rules for KT~R~ are\n\nModus Ponens\n\n:   If $A \\rightarrow B$ is a theorem and $A$ is a theorem, then $B$ is\n    a theorem\n\nRestricted Necessitation\n\n:   If $A$ is a theorem and $\\square A$ is well-formed, then $\\square A$\n    is a theorem.\n\nGiven these, we can now define a maximal consistent set for KT~R~. It is\na set $S$ of sentences with the following three properties:\n\n-   All theorems of KT~R~ are in $S$.\n\n-   For all $A$, either $A$ is in *S* or $\\neg A$ is in $S$.\n\n-   $S$ is closed under modus ponens.\n\nThe existence of Kripke models for KT~R~ show that some maximal\nconsistent sets exist: the set of truths at any point will be a maximal\nconsistent set. The canonical model for KT~R~ is\n$\\langle W, R, V \\rangle$ where\n\n-   *W* is the set of maximal consistent sets for KT~R~\n\n-   *R* is a subset of *W* $\\times$ *W* such that *w*~1~*Rw*~2~ iff for\n    all $A$ such that $\\square A \\in$ *w*~1~, $A \\in$ *w*~2~\n\n-   $V$ is the valuation such that $V$($A$) = {*w*: $A \\in$ *w*}\n\nSince all instances of T are theorems, it can be easily shown that *R*\nis reflexive, and hence that this is a frame for KT~R~ and hence that\nKT~R~ is canonically complete.\n\nWe can translate all sentences of KT~R~ into a language that contains\n$\\geqslant _T$ but not $\\square$. Just replace\n$\\square$($B \\rightarrow A$) with $A \\geqslant _T B$ wherever $\\square$\noccurs including inside sentences. (We appeal here and here alone to the\nrestriction in KT~R~.) Translating the axioms for KT~R~, we get the\nfollowing axioms for the logic of $\\geqslant _T$.\n\n-   All classical tautologies\n\n-   All instances of:\n    ($B$  $\\geqslant _T A$) $\\rightarrow$ (($A \\geqslant _T$ ($A \\rightarrow A$)) $\\rightarrow$\n    ($B \\geqslant _T$ ($B \\rightarrow B$)))\n\n-   All instances of:\n    ($B \\geqslant _T A$) $\\rightarrow$ ($A \\rightarrow B$)\n\nThe rules are\n\nModus ponens\n\n:   If $A \\rightarrow B$ is a theorem and $A$ is a theorem, then $B$ is\n    a theorem.\n\nDetermination\n\n:   If $A \\rightarrow B$ is a theorem, then $B \\geqslant _T A$ is a\n    theorem.\n\nWe can simplify somewhat by replacing the second axiom schema with\n\n-   All instances of:\n    $A \\geqslant _T B \\rightarrow$ ($B \\geqslant _T C \\rightarrow A \\geqslant _T C$)\n\nA Kripke model for this logic is just a Kripke model for KT, except we\nsay $B \\geqslant _T A$ is true at a point iff $B$ is true at all\naccessible points at which $A$ is true. This leads to a semantic\ndefinition of validity. An argument is valid iff it preserves truth at\nany point in all such models.\n\nMaximal consistent sets with respect to $\\geqslant _T$ and a canonical\nmodel for $\\geqslant _T$ can be easily constructed by parallel with the\nmaximal consistent sets and canonical models for KT~R~. These\nconstructions show that if $A$ is a theorem of the logic for\n$\\geqslant _T$, then it is true at all points in all models. More\ngenerally, they can be used to show that this logic is canonically\ncomplete, though the details of the proof are omitted. The maximal\nconsistent sets for $\\geqslant _T$, i.e. the points in the canonical\nmodel, just are the results of applying the translation rule\n$\\square$($B \\rightarrow A$) $\\Rightarrow A \\geqslant _T B$ to the\n(sentences in the) maximal consistent sets for KT~R~.\n\nThat's important because the points in the canonical model for\n$\\geqslant _T$ are useful for understanding the relationship between\n*truer* and *true*, and for understanding what languages are. The set of\ntrue sentences in English is one of the points in the canonical model\nfor $\\geqslant _T$. For semantic purposes, languages just are points in\nthis canonical model. It is indeterminate just which such point English\nis, but it is one of them. For many purposes it is useful to think of\nthe theory based on *truer* as a variant on $M$. But considering the\ncanonical model for $\\geqslant _T$ highlights the similarities with\nsupervaluationism rather than the similarities with $M$, for the points\nin the canonical model look a lot like precisifications. It is, however,\nworth noting the many differences between my theory and\nsupervaluationism. I identify languages with a single point rather than\nwith a set of points, which leads to the smoother treatment of\nhigher-order vagueness on my account. Also, I don't start with a set of\nacceptable points/precisifications. The canonical model contains all the\npoints that are formally consistent, and I identify particular\nlanguages, like English, by vaguely saying that the point that\nrepresents English is (roughly) there. (Imagine my vaguely pointing at\nsome part of the model when saying this.) The most important difference\nis that I take the points, with the truer than relation already defined,\nto be primitive, and the accessibility/acceptability relation to be\ndefined in terms of them. This reflects the fact that I take the *truer*\nrelation to be primitive, and determinacy to be defined in terms of it,\nwhereas typically supervaluationists do things the other way around.\nNone of these differences are huge, but they all favour my theory over\nsupervaluationism.\n\nTo return to the point about higher order vagueness, note that all of\nthe following sentences are consistent in KT, and hence their\n'equivalents' using \\>~T~ are also consistent.\n\nAnd obviously this pattern can be extended indefinitely. In general, any\nclaim of the form that $a$ is an $n$-th order borderline case of an $F$\nis consistent in this theory, as can be seen by comparison with KT.\n\nTo close this section, I will note that we can also provide a fairly\nstraightforward natural deduction system for the logic of\n$\\geqslant _T$. There are two philosophical benefits to doing this.\nFirst, it proves my earlier claim that I can keep all inference rules of\nclassical logic. Second, it helps justify (A1) to (A10). Most rules\ncorrespond directly to one of the constraints. For that reason I've set\nall the rules, even though you've probably seen most of them before.\n\n($\\wedge$ In)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A$, $\\Delta$ $\\vdash$\n    $B \\Rightarrow \\Gamma \\cup\\Delta \\vdash A \\wedge B$\n\n($\\wedge$ Out-left)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\wedge B \\Rightarrow$ $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A$\n\n($\\wedge$ Out-right)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\wedge B \\Rightarrow$ $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $B$\n\n($\\vee$ In-left)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $B \\Rightarrow$  $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\vee B$\n\n($\\vee$ In-right)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\Rightarrow$  $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\vee B$\n\n($\\vee$ Out)\n\n:   $\\Gamma \\cup${$A$} $\\vdash$ $C$, $\\Delta \\cup${$B$} $\\vdash$ $C$,\n    $\\Lambda$ $\\vdash$  $A \\vee B \\Rightarrow$\n    $\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta \\cup \\Lambda \\vdash C$\n\n($\\rightarrow$ In)\n\n:   $\\Gamma \\cup${$A$} $\\vdash$ $B \\Rightarrow$  $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$\n    $A \\rightarrow B$\n\n($\\rightarrow$ Out)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\rightarrow B$, $\\Delta$\n    $\\vdash A \\Rightarrow \\Gamma \\cup \\Delta \\vdash B$\n\n($\\neg$ In)\n\n:   $\\Gamma \\cup${$A$} $\\vdash$ $B \\wedge \\neg B \\Rightarrow$  $\\Gamma$\n    $\\vdash$ $\\neg A$\n\n($\\neg$ Out)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash \\neg \\neg A \\Rightarrow$ $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A$\n\n($\\geqslant _T$ In)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\Rightarrow$ {$B \\geqslant _T C$: $B \\in$ \n    $\\Gamma$} $\\vdash$  $A \\geqslant _T C$\n\n($\\geqslant _T$ Convert)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$  $A \\geqslant _T B \\Rightarrow$  $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$\n    ($B \\rightarrow A$)$\\geqslant _T C$\n\n($\\geqslant _T$ Out)\n\n:   $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$ $A \\geqslant _T B \\Rightarrow$  $\\Gamma$ $\\vdash$\n     $B \\rightarrow A$\n\n(Thanks to Gabriel Uzquiano for several probing questions that led to\nthis section being written.)\n\n### Sexy Sorites \n\nA good theory of vagueness should tell us two things about the Sorites.\nThe easy part is to say what is wrong with Sorites arguments: not all\npremises are perfectly true. The hard part is to say why the premises\nlooked plausible to start with. The $M$ theorist has the beginnings of a\nstory, though not the end of a story. The beginning is that all the\npremises in a typical Sorites argument are nearly true, and they look\nplausible because we confuse near truth for truth. Can I say the same\nthing, since my theory is like $M$? No, for two reasons. First, since my\ntheory explicitly gets rid of numerical representations of intermediate\ntruth values, I don't have any way to analyse *almost true*. Second,\nsince I say that one of the Sorites premises is false, I'd be committed\nto the odd view that some false sentence is almost perfectly true.\nThanks to Cian Dorr for pointing out this consequence.\n\nThe story the $M$ theorist tells does not generalise. The problem is\nthat not all Sorites arguments involve conditionals. A typical Sorites\nsituation involves a chain from a definite $F$ to a definite not-$F$.\nLet $^\\prime$ denote the successor relation in this sequence, so if $F$\nis *is tall* and $a$ is 178cm tall, then $a ^\\prime$ will be 177.99cm\ntall, assuming the sequence progresses 0.1mm at a time. According to\n$M$, every premise like (SI) is almost true.\n\n(SI)\n\n:   If $a$ is tall, then $a ^\\prime$ is tall.\n\nBut we could have built a Sorites argument with premises like (SA).\n\n(SA)\n\n:   It is not the case that $a$ is tall and $a ^\\prime$ is not tall.\n\nAnd premises of this form are not, in general, almost true. Indeed, some\nwill have a truth value not much about 0.5. So $M$ has no explanation\nfor why premises like (SA) look persuasive. This is quite bad, because\n(SA) is *more* plausible than (SI) as I'll now show. Consider the\nfollowing thought experiment. You are trying to get a group of\n(typically non-responsive) undergraduates to appreciate the force of the\nSorites paradox. If they don't feel the force of (SI), how do you\npersuade them? My first instinct is to appeal to something like (SA). If\nthat doesn't work, I appeal to theoretical considerations about how our\nuse of *tall* couldn't possibly pick a boundary between $a$ and\n$a ^\\prime$. I think I find (SI) plausible *because* I find (SA)\nplausible, and I would try to get the students to feel likewise. There's\nan asymmetry here. I wouldn't defend (SA) by appealing to (SI), and I\ndon't find (SA) plausible because it follows from (SI). (This is not to\nendorse universally quantified versions of either (SA) or (SI). They are\nlike Axiom V - claims that remain intuitively plausible even when we\nknow they are false.)\n\nSadly, many theories have little to say about why (SA) seems true. The\nofficial epistemicist story is that speakers only accept sentences that\nare determinately, i.e. knowably, true. But some instances of (SA) are\nactually *false*, and many many more are not knowably true. The\nsupervaluationist story about (SA) is no better.\n\nHere's a surprising fact about the Sorites that puts an unexpected\nconstraint on explanations of why (SA) is plausible. In the history of\ndebates about it, I don't think anyone has put forward a Sorites\nargument where the major premises are like (SO).\n\n(SO)\n\n:   Either $a$ is not tall, or $a ^\\prime$ is tall.\n\n(This point is also noticed in @SiderBraun.) There's a good reason for\nthis: (SO) is *not* intuitively true, unless perhaps one sees it as a\nroundabout way of saying (SA). In this respect it conflicts quite\nsharply with (SA), which *is* intuitively true. But hardly any theory of\nvagueness (certainly not $M$ or supervaluationism or epistemicism)\nprovide grounds for distinguishing (SA) from (SO), since most theories\nof vagueness endorse DeMorgan's laws. Further, none of the many and\nvaried recent solutions to the Sorites that do not rely on varying the\nunderlying logic (e.g. @Fara2000 [@Sorensen2001; @Eklund2002]) seem to\ndo any better at distinguishing (SA) from (SO). As far as I can tell\nnone of these theories *could*, given their current conceptual\nresources, tell a story about why (SA) is intuitively plausible that\ndoes not falsely predict (SO) is intuitively plausible. That is, none of\nthese theories could solve the Sorites paradox with their current\nresources.\n\nThere is, however, a simple theory that does predict that (SA) will look\nplausible while (SO) will not. Kit @Fine1975a noted that if we assume\nthat speakers systematically confuse $p$ for *Determinately p*, even\nwhen $p$ occurs as a constituent of larger sentences rather than as a\nstandalone sentence, then we can explain why speakers may accept vague\ninstances of the law of non-contradiction, but not vague instances of\nthe law of excluded middle. (That speakers do have these differing\nreactions to the two laws has been noted in a few places, most\nprominently @Burgess1987 and @Tappenden1993.) It's actually rather\nremarkable how many true predictions one can make using Fine's\nhypothesis. It correctly predicts that (5) should sound acceptable.\n\nNow (5) is a contradiction, so both the fact that it sounds acceptable\nif I am a borderline case of vagueness, and the fact that some theory\npredicts this, are quite remarkable. This is about as good as it gets in\nterms of evidence for a philosophical claim.\n\n(We might wonder just why Fine's hypothesis is true. One idea is that\nthere really isn't any difference in truth value between $p$ and\n*Determinately p*. This leads to the absurd position that some\ncontradictions, like (5), are literally true. I prefer the following\ntwo-part explanation. The first part is that when one utters a simple\nsubject-predicate sentence, one implicates that the subject\n*determinately* satisfies the predicate. This is a much stronger\nimplicature than conversational implicature, since it is not\ncancellable. And it does not seem to be a conventional implicature.\nRather, it falls into the category of nonconventional nonconversational\nimplicatures Grice suggests exists on pg. 41 of his [-@Grice1989]. The\nsecond part is that some implicatures, including determinacy\nimplicatures, are computed locally and the results of the computations\npassed up to whatever system computes the intuitive content of the whole\nsentence. This implies that constituents of sentences can have\nimplicatures. This theme has been studied quite a bit recently; see\n@Levinson2000 for a survey of the linguistic data and @Sedivy1999 for\nsome empirical evidence supporting up this claim. Just which, if any,\nimplicatures are computed locally is a major research question, but\nthere is *some* evidence that Fine's hypothesis is the consequence of a\nrelatively deep fact about linguistic processing. This isn't essential\nto the current project - really all that matters is that Fine's\nhypothesis is true - but it does suggest some interesting further lines\nof research and connections to ongoing research projects.)\n\nIf Fine's hypothesis is true, then we have a simple explanation for the\nattractiveness of (SA). Speakers regularly confuse (SA) for (6), which\nis true, while they confuse (SO) for (7), which is false.\n\nThis explanation cannot *directly* explain why speakers find (SI)\nattractive. My explanation for this, however, has already been given.\nThe intuitive force behind (SI) comes from the fact that it follows, or\nat least appears to follow, from (SA), which looks practically\nundeniable.\n\nSo Fine's hypothesis gives us an explanation of what's going on in\nSorites arguments that is available in principle to a wide variety of\ntheorists. Fine proposed it in part to defend a supervaluationist\ntheory, and @Keefe2000 adopts it for a similar purpose. Patrick\n@Greenough2003 has recently adopted a similar looking proposal to\nprovide an epistemicist explanation of similar data. (Nothing in the\nexplanation of the attractiveness of Sorites premises turns on any\n*analysis* of determinacy, so the story can be told by epistemicists and\nsupervaluationists alike.) And the story can be added to the theory of\n*truer* sketched here. It might be regretted that we don't have a\n*distinctive* story about the Sorites in terms of *truer*. But the\nhypothesis that some sentences are truer than others is basically a\n*semantic* hypothesis, and if the reason Sorites premises look\nattractive is anything like the reason (5) looks *prima facie*\nattractive, then that attractiveness should receive a *pragmatic*\nexplanation. What is really important is that there be some story about\nthe Sorites we can tell.\n\n### Linearity Intuitions\n\nThe assumption that *truer* is a non-linear relation is the basis for\nmost of the distinctive features of my theory, so it should be defended.\nThere are two reasons to believe it.\n\nOne is that we can't simultaneously accept all of the following five\nprinciples.\n\n-   *Truer* is a linear relation.\n\n-   (A2), that conjunction is a greatest lower bound.\n\n-   (A4), that negation is order inverting.\n\n-   (A7), that contradictions are determinately false.\n\n-   There are indeterminate sentences.\n\nI think by far the least plausible of these is the first, so it must go.\n\nLinearity (or at least determinate linearity) also makes it difficult to\ntell a plausible story about higher order vagueness. Linearity is the\nclaim that for any two sentences $A$ and $B$, the following disjunction\nholds. Either $A$ \\>~T~ $B$, or $B$ \\>~T~ $A$, or $A =_T B$. If truer is\ndeterminately linear, that disjunction is determinately true. And if\n*truer* is linear, and if that disjunction is determinately true, then\none of its disjuncts must be determinately true, for linearity rules out\nthe possibility of a determinately true disjunction with no\ndeterminately true disjunct. Now take a special case of that\ndisjunction, where $B$ is 0=0. In that case we can rule out\n$A$ \\>~T~ $B$. So the only options are $B$ \\>~T~ $A$ or $A =_T B$. We\nhave concluded that given linearity, one of these disjuncts must be\ndeterminately true. That is, $A$ is either determinately intermediate or\ndeterminately determinate. But intuitively neither of these need be\ntrue, for $A$ might be in the 'penumbra' between the determinately\nintermediate and the determinately determinate. This argument is only a\nproblem if we assume determinate linearity, but it's hard to see the\ntheoretical motivation for believing in linearity but not determinate\nlinearity.\n\nStill, it is very easy to believe in linearity. Even for comparatives\nthat are clearly non-linear, like *more intelligent than*, there is a\nstrong temptation to treat them as linear. (Numerical measurements of\nintelligence are obviously inappropriate given that *more intelligent\nthan* is non-linear, but there's a large industry involved in producing\nsuch measurements.) And this temptation leads to some prima facie\nplausible objections to my theory. (All of these objections arose in the\ndiscussion of the paper at BSPC.)\n\n##### True and Truer (due to Cian Dorr) {#true-and-truer-due-to-cian-dorr .unnumbered}\n\nHere's an odd consequence of my theory plus the plausible assumption\nthat *If S then S is true* is axiomatic. We can't infer from $A$ is true\nand $B$ is false that $A$ is truer than $B$. But this looks like a\nreasonably plausible inference.\n\nIf we added this as inference rule, we would rule out all intermediate\nsentences. To prove this assume, for *reductio*, that $A$ is\nintermediate. Since we keep classical logic, we know $A \\vee \\neg A$ is\ntrue. If *A*, then $A$ is true, and hence $\\neg A$ is false. Then the\nnew this inference rule implies $A \\geqslant _T \\neg A$, hence\n$A$${\\wedge}{\\neg}$$A \\geqslant _T \\neg A$, since\n$\\neg A \\geqslant _T \\neg A$, and hence 0=1$\\geqslant _T \\neg A$, since\n0=1 $\\geqslant _T A \\wedge \\neg A$, and $\\geqslant _T$ is transitive. So\n$A$ is determinately true, not intermediate. A converse proof shows that\nif $\\neg A$, then $A$ is determinately false, not intermediate. So by\n($\\vee$-Out) it follows that $A$ is not intermediate, but since $A$ was\narbitrary, there are no intermediate truths. So this rule is\nunacceptable, despite its plausibility.\n\n##### Comparing Negative and Positive (due to Jonathan Schaffer) {#comparing-negative-and-positive-due-to-jonathan-schaffer .unnumbered}\n\nLet $a$ be a regular borderline case of genius, somewhere near the\nmiddle of the penumbra. Let *b* be someone who is not a determinate case\nof genius, but is very close. Let $A$ be *a is a genius* and $B$ be *b\nis a genius*. It seems plausible that $A \\geqslant _T \\neg B$, since $a$\nis right around the middle of the borderline cases of genius, but *b* is\nonly a smidgen short of clear genius. But since *b* is closer to being a\ngenius than $a$, we definitely have $B \\geqslant _T A$. By transitivity,\nit follows that $B \\geqslant _T \\neg B$, hence $B$ is determinately true\n(by the reasoning of the last paragraph). Since $\\neg B$ is not\ndeterminately false, it follows that $B \\wedge \\neg B$ is not\ndeterminately false, contradicting (A7).\n\nSince I accept (A7) I must reject the initial assumption that\n$A \\geqslant _T \\neg B$. But it's worth noting that this case is quite\ngeneral. Similar reasoning could be used to show that for any\nindeterminate propositions of the form $x$ *is a genius* and *y* *is not\na genius*, the first is not truer than the second. This seems odd, since\nintuitively these could both be indeterminate while the first is very\nnearly true and the second very nearly false.\n\n##### Comparing Different Predicates (due to Elizabeth Harman) {#comparing-different-predicates-due-to-elizabeth-harman .unnumbered}\n\nOne intuitive way to understand the behaviour of *truer* is that $A$ is\ntruer than $B$ iff $A$ is true on every admissible precisification on\nwhich $B$ is true and the converse does not hold. This can't be an\nanalysis of *truer*, since it assumes we can independently define what\nis an admissible precisification, and this seems impossible. But it's a\nuseful heuristic. And reflecting on it brings up a surprising\nconsequence of my theory. If we assume that precisifications of\npredicates from different subject areas (e.g. *hexagonal* and *honest*)\nare independent, it follows that subject-predicate sentences involving\nthose predicates and indeterminate instances of them are incomparable\nwith respect to truth. But this seems implausible. If France is a\nborderline case of being hexagonal that is close to the lower bound, and\nGeorge Washington is a borderline case of being honest who is close to\nthe upper bound, then we should think *George Washington is honest* is\ntruer than *France is hexagonal*.\n\nAll three of these objections seem to me to turn on an underlying\nintuition that *truer* should be a linear relation. If we are given\nthis, then the inference principle Dorr suggests looks unimpeachable,\nand the comparisons Schaffer and Harman suggested look right. But once\nwe drop the idea that truer is linear, I think the plausibility of these\nclaims falls away. So the arguments against linearity are ipso facto\narguments that we should simply drop the intuitions Dorr, Schaffer and\nHarman are relying upon.\n\nTo conclude, it's worth noting that a very similar inferential rule to\nthe rule Dorr suggests is admissible. From the fact that $A$ is\ndeterminately true, and $B$ is determinately false, it follows that $A$\nis truer than *B*. If we assume, as seems reasonable, that we're only in\na position to *say* that $A$ is true when it is determinately true, then\nwhenever we're in a position to say $A$ is true and $B$ is false, it\nwill be true that $A$ is truer than $B$. This line of defence is\nobviously similar to the explanation I gave in the previous section of\nwhy Sorites premises look plausible, and to the argument Rosanna Keefe\ngives that the failure of classical inference rules is no difficulty for\nsupervaluationism because it admits very similar inference rules\n[@Keefe2000].\n",
