Before that,\nI'll start with some taxonomy, just so as it's clear what the intended\nconclusions below are supposed to be.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophical Perspectives_ 22: 527-544.\n\nPicture by [Andreina Schoeberlein](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41757196@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/daf0538b-ad69-498d-88af-23f2611b58fb).\n</aside>\n\n### How Not to be a Strawman\n\nHere are three mappings that we, as theorists about language, might be\ninterested in.\n\n-   **Physical Movements** $\\rightarrow$ **Speech Acts**. I'm currently\n    moving my fingers across a keyboard. In doing so, I'm making various\n    assertions. It's a hard question to say just how I manage to make an\n    assertion by moving my fingers in this way. Relatedly, it's a hard\n    question to say just which assertions, requests, questions, commands\n    etc people make by making physical movements. This mapping is the\n    answer to that question.\n\n-   **Speech Acts** $\\rightarrow$ **Contents**. For some speech acts,\n    their content is clear. If I assert that grass is green, the content\n    of my assertion is that grass is green. For other speech acts,\n    including perhaps other assertions, it is not immediately obvious\n    what their content is. This mapping answers that question.\n\n-   **Contents** $\\rightarrow$ **Truth Values**. Given a content, it\n    isn't always clear whether it is true or false (or perhaps something\n    else). This mapping provides the truth values of every content of\n    every speech act.\n\nThe details of each of these mappings is interesting, to say the least.\nIndeed, a full description of those mappings would arguably include an\nanswer to every question ever asked. We're not likely to know that any\ntime soon. But we can ask, and perhaps answer, interesting questions\nabout the topology of the mappings. Here are two distinct questions we\ncan ask about each of the three mappings.\n\n-   **Is it one-one or one-many?** The mapping from a natural number to\n    its natural predecessor is one-one. That's to say, every number is\n    mapped to at most one other number. The mapping from a person to the\n    children they have is one-many. That's not to say that everyone has\n    many children, or indeed that everyone has any children. It's merely\n    to say that some things in the domain are mapped to many things in\n    the range.\n\n-   **Is the mapping absolute or relative, and if relative, relative to\n    what?** Consider a mapping that takes a person A as input, and\n    relative to any person B, outputs the first child that A has with B.\n    This mapping is relative; there's no such thing as the output of the\n    function for any particular input A. All there is, is the output\n    relative to B1, relative to B2, and so on. But note that in a good\n    sense the mapping is one-one. Relative to any B, A is mapped to at\n    most one person.\n\nA very simple model of context-sensitivity in language says that all\nthree of these mappings are one-one and absolute. It will be helpful to\nhave a character who accepts that, so imagine we have a person, called\nStrawman, who does. There are six basic ways to reject Strawman's views.\nFor each of the three mappings, we can say that it is one-many or we can\nsay that it is relative.\n\nThis way of thinking about Strawman's opponents gives us a nice\ntaxonomy. The first mapping is about *speech acts*, the second about\n*contents* and the third about *truth*. Someone who disagrees with\nStrawman disagrees about one of these three mappings. They might\ndisagree by being a *pluralist*, i.e. thinking that the mapping is\none-many. Or they might disagree by being a *relativist*, i.e. thinking\nthe mapping is relative to some thing external. The respective defenders\nof Strawman on these questions are the *monists* and the *absolutists*.\n\nSo the *speech act pluralist* is the person who thinks the first mapping\nis one-many. The *content relativist*, is the person who thinks the\nsecond is relative to some other variable (perhaps an assessor). And the\n*truth monist* is the person who thinks that contents have (at most) one\ntruth value. All these terms are a little bit stipulative, but I think\nit the terminology here somewhat matches up with regular use. And it's\nthe terminology I'll use throughout this paper.\n\nOne other nice advantage of this taxonomy is that it helps clarify just\nwhat is at issue between various opponents of Strawman. So Andy\n@Egan2009-EGABBA has some data about uses of \"you\" in group settings\nthat suggest such utterances pose a problem for Strawman. But it's one\nthing to have evidence that Strawman is wrong, another altogether to\nknow which of his views is, on a particular occasion, wrong. I think\nseparating out Strawman's various commitments helps clarify what is\nneeded to isolate Strawman's mistake on an occasion.\n\nIt is, I think, more or less common ground that the first of Strawman's\ncommitments, speech act monism, is false. The King can, by uttering\n\"It's cold in here\", both assert that it's cold in here, and command his\nlackey to close the window. Those look like two distinct speech acts\nthat he's made with the one physical movement. Herman Cappellen and\nErnest Lepore [@Cappelen2005] have many more examples to show that\nStrawman is wrong here. Once we go beyond that though, it's less clear\nthat Strawman is mistaken. Perhaps by thinking about cases where, by the\none physical movement, we intend to communicate *p* to one audience\nmember, and *q* to another, we can try to motivate speech-act\nrelativism. That's an issue I'll leave for another day. In contrast to\nwhat he says about speech acts, what Strawman says about content and\ntruth is, if not universally accepted, at least popular. So I'll call\n*orthodox contextualism* the view that Strawman is right about the\ncontent mapping and the truth mapping; each mapping is both one-one and\nabsolute.\n\nIt is worthwhile noting two very separate models for content that lead\nto two quite distinct ways in which we can reject Strawman's last two\nabsolutist views. John MacFarlane's paper on Non-Indexical Contextualism\n@MacFarlane2009-MACNC was extremely useful in setting up the relevant\ndistinctions here, but the particular models for content I'm describing\nhere are both set out in greatest detail in recent work by Andy Egan.\n\nThe first is the centred worlds model for content. This is the idea that\nfor some utterance types, any token of that type expresses the same\ncontent. But that content is a set of centred worlds, that is true at\nsome centres and false at other centres in the same world. So we might\nthink that the content of \"Beer is tasty\" is, roughly, the set of\npossibilia who have pro-attitudes to the taste of beer. More precisely,\nit is the set of world-centre pairs such that the agent at (or perhaps\nclosest to) the centre has pro-attitudes towards the taste of beer. On\nthis view, content monism will be maintained -- what an utterance of\n\"Beer is tasty\" says is invariant across assessors. (I'm assuming here\nthat assessor-relativity is the only relativity we're interested in.)\nBut truth absolutism will fail, since whether that content is true for\n*a*~1~ and *a*~2~ will depend on what their attitudes are towards beer.\nThis kind of centred worlds model for content is what Egan has developed\nin [@Egan2007-EGAEMR].\n\nThe second model lets assessors get into the content-fixing mechanism,\nbut says the content that is fixed is a familiar proposition whose truth\nis not assessor relative. This is easiest to explain with an example\ninvolving second-person pronouns. For some utterances of \"You are a\nfool\", the content of that utterance, relative to *x*, is that *x* is a\nfool. Now whether *x* is indeed a fool is a simple factual question, and\nwhether it is true isn't assessor relative. But if some people are fools\nand others are not, whether the utterance is true or false depends on\nwho is assessing it. So content relativism is true, while truth\nabsolutism is preserved. This is a view Egan has defended for some\ntokens of second person pronouns [@Egan2009-EGABBA] .\n\nIn \"Conditionals and Indexical Relativism\" [@Weatherson2009-WEACAI], I\ncalled the combination of content relativism and truth absolutism\n\"indexical relativism\", and defended such a view about indicative\nconditionals. I called something similar to the combination of truth\nrelativism and content absolutism \"non-indexical contextualism\". More\nprecisely, I followed MacFarlane in using that phrase for the\ncombination of truth relativism and content absolutism and the view that\nwhether a speaker's utterance is true (relative to an assessor) is a\nmatter of whether the proposition they express is true relative to their\ncontext. I like the name \"indexical relativism\", but it has also been\nused for theories that aren't even heterodox in the above sense, so\nperhaps persisting with it would just invite confusion. (And the name\nimplies a particular view about how the relativity works; namely that\nthere is something like an indexical element in what's asserted that\ngets its value from the context of assessment.) In other contexts I've\nused \"relativism\" as the label for all and only heterodox views, but\nthis label is potentially quite confusing. Indeed, it's a possible worry\nabout the arguments in my \"Conditionals and Indexical Relativism\" that\nthey really just support heterodoxy; a separate argument would be needed\n(and might not be easy to supply) against pluralist alternatives to\ncontent relativism about indicative conditionals.\n\n### Factive Verbs and Relativism\n\nIn \"CIA Leaks\" [@vonFintel2008], Kai von Fintel and Thony Gillies raise\na problem for heterodox theories about 'might'. (Actually they raise\nseveral, but I'm only going to deal with one of them here.) Their\nprimary target is what I called truth relativist theories, but the\nargument they raise is interesting to consider from all heterodox\nperspectives. The problem concerns embedding of 'might'-clauses under\nfactive attitude verbs. They argue as follows:\n\n1.  *S realises that p* presupposes that *p*.\n\n2.  This presupposition is carried over when the sentence is used as the\n    antecedent of a conditional. So, for instance, *If S realises that\n    p, then q* presupposes that *p*.\n\n3.  But, on standard heterodox proposals, we can properly say *If S\n    realises that it might be that p, then q*, even though it isn't true\n    that it might be that *p*.\n\n4.  So heterodox proposals are false.\n\nHere is the example they use to make the case.\n\n> Bond planted a bug and some misleading evidence pointing to his being\n> in Zuurich and slipped out. Now he and Leiter are listening in from\n> London. As they listen, Leiter is getting a bit worried: Blofeld\n> hasn't yet found the misleading evidence that points to Bond's being\n> in Zurich. Leiter turns to Bond and says:\n>\n> 1.  If Blofeld realizes you might be in Zurich, you can breathe\n>     easy---he'll send his henchman to Zurich to find you. (93)\n>\n> Now the problem is that for the heterodox theorist, \"You might be in\n> Zurich\", as uttered by Leiter to Bond, expresses (relative to Bond), a\n> proposition that is true iff for all Bond knows, Bond might be in\n> Zurich. Just how it does this will differ for different heterodox\n> theorists, but so far they all agree. But that isn't the case; since\n> Bond knows he is in London. So (34) should sound defective, since it\n> contains a presupposition failure. But it isn't defective, so\n> heterodoxy is mistaken.\n\nBefore we look at how heterodox theorists might respond to this case,\nit's worth looking thinking about how Strawman might respond to it. The\nsimplest idea is to say that in *It might be that p*, there is a hidden\nvariable *X*. The value of *X* is set by context. And the sentence\nexpresses the proposition that for all *X* knows, *p* is true. (Perhaps\nwe might use some epistemic relation other than 'knows', but that's not\nrelevant here.)\n\nNow, and this is crucial, the variable *X* might be either free or\nbound. If there is nothing around to bind it, as in a simple utterance\nof *It might be that p*, then it will be free. And typically if it is\nfree, *X* denotes a group consisting of the speaker and perhaps those in\nthe same conversation. But when the might-clause is embedded under a\npropositional attitude ascription (factive or not), the variable *X*\nwill be bound to the subject of the attitude ascription. So in *Y\nbelieves that it might be that p*, the value of *X* will simply be *Y*.\nSo in *Blofeld realises you might be in Zurich*, the value of *X* is\nBlofeld. And hence the embedded might claim is true, since that claim is\nsimply that for all Blofeld knows, Bond is in Zurich. Which, in the\nstory, is true.\n\nThe reason for going through all of this is that the theorist who\naccepts truth absolutism, but rejects content absolutism, can say\nexactly the same thing. There is a variable *X* in the structure of\nwhat's asserted. Strawman thinks that you only get a determinate\nassertion when you fill in the value of *X*. We can disagree with that;\nwe can say that an assertion can literally contain a variable, one that\npotentially gets its value from assessors. That way the content of a\nparticular assertion can be different for different assessors. Once\nwe've made this move, we can rejoin Strawman's story. This variable is\neither free or bound. If it is bound, we tell exactly the same story as\nStrawman. But, we insist, if it is free, the value of *X* is sometimes\nset by contextual features of the hearer as well as of the assessor. In\nthe standard case, *X* is a group consisting of the speaker, the hearer,\nand perhaps some people who get in the group in virtue of their\nproximity to the speaker or hearer.\n\nSo we end up saying the same thing about the acceptability of (34) as\nStrawman. The content of *You might be in Zurich,* as embedded in (34),\nis quite different to the content those words would have if uttered as a\nstandalone sentence, because the value that a key variable takes is\ndifferent. For us, the value that variable takes differs for different\nassessors, but that's completely irrelevant to the explanation of the\nacceptability of (34).\n\nFor the truth relativist (who is also a content absolutist) things are a\nlittle more interesting. Such a theorist will typically reject the\npresence of a variable like X in the structure of what is said. So they\ncannot appeal to the kind of explanation that we've offered (twice over)\nfor how (34) may be acceptable. The solution is to simply reject the\ngeneralisation about factive verbs. Let's start with some seemingly\ndistant examples, in particular examples about fiction. It seems that\n(5) doesn't have any false presuppositions.\n\n5.  Watson realised that private detectives were (in late 19th Century\n    London) better at solving murder mysteries than police.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n6.  Had Watson realised earlier that private detectives were better at\n    solving murder mysteries than police, he would have liked Holmes\n    more than he did.\n\n7.  Had Watson realised earlier that private detectives were better at\n    solving murder mysteries than police, the early chapters of the book\n    would have been more interesting.\n\nNote that this isn't anything particular to do with subjunctive\nconditionals. Imagine that we are settling down to watch a new\nadaptation of the Holmes stories that we are told won't be particularly\nfaithful to the books in detail. I might properly say (8).\n\n8.  If Watson realises that private detectives were better at solving\n    murder mysteries than police, the early scenes will be more\n    interesting.\n\nBut now it is easy to see the way out of the argument for the proponent\nof the centred world view. The crucial thing about Watson isn't, such a\ntheorist will say, that he's in another possible world. The crucial\nthing is that some propositions that are false relative to us (e.g. the\nproposition that private detectives were better at solving murder\nmysteries than police) are true relative to him. The true generalisation\nseems to be that S Vs that p, where V is factive, presupposes that p is\ntrue relative to S. And that's true in the cases that von Fintel and\nGillies describe. So it's not true that the centred world theorist\nshould predict that these utterances have false presuppositions. And\nthat's all to the good, because of course they don't.\n\n### Glanzberg on Metasemantics\n\nPapers arguing for relativism about some term *t* frequently, perhaps\ntypically, start with a survey of reasons why (orthodox) contextualism\nabout *t* cannot be correct. And such a survey will frequently include a\nsojourn through some quite specific contextualist theories, with some\nfairly obvious counterexamples. @Egan2005-EGAEMI sticks to the script as\nfar as this goes. We note that *a* *might be F* can't, for instance,\nmean that *For all S knows, a is F*, where *S* is the speaker. And we\nnote that some other simple theories along the same lines can't be true.\n\nIt's interesting to think through what kind of force such tours through\nthe possible contextualist theories could have. We might think that\nthere's a tacit argument that if some contextualist theory were true, it\nwould be one of these simple ones, and none of the simple ones is true,\nso no contextualist theory is true. I'm not going to take a stand on\nexegetical debates here, so I'm not going to consider who may or may not\nhave been making such an argument. I don't think that it was the\nintended argument in @Egan2005-EGAEMI, but that's beside the point,\nbecause it is an argument that's now being debated. The argument under\nconsideration isn't, or at least isn't directly, that the\ncontextualist's *semantic* proposal is mistaken. Rather, the argument is\nthat the accompanying *metasemantic* theory, i.e. the theory of how\nsemantic values get fixed, is intolerably complicated. Slightly more\nformally, we can argue as follows.\n\n1.  If contextualism is true, the metasemantic theory of how a\n    particular use of \"might\" gets its semantic value is hideously\n    complicated.\n\n2.  Metasemantic theories about how context-sensitive terms get their\n    values on particular occasions are never hideously complicated.\n\n3.  So, contextualism is false.\n\nThe problem with this argument, as @Glanzberg2007 has argued, is that\npremise 2 seems to be false. If we just look at some so-called\n'automatic' indexicals, like \"I\" or \"here\" or \"now\", it just may be\nplausible. (But even in those cases things are tricky when we look at\nrecordings, as in @Weatherson2002-WEAMI.) Once we widen our gaze though,\nwe see that there are examples of uncontroversially context-sensitive\nterms, like \"that\", for which the accompanying metasemantic theory is,\nby any standard, hideously complicated. So the prospects of getting to\nrelativism from metasemantic complexity are not, I think, promising.\n\nThat isn't the only kind of metasemantic argument for relativism though.\nA better argument for relativism turns on the fact that metasemantics\n*is* generally complicated. The contextualist, I think, has to make\nmetasemantics too systematic at a key point. (Again, I'm not doing\nexegesis, but I do think something like this argument was intended in\nEgan et al (2005). I'm largely here highlighting something that I think\nhas been thus far overlooked in the commentaries on that piece.)\nConsider the following pair of sentences.\n\n9.  Those guys are in trouble, but they don't know that they are.\n\n10. ??Those guys are in trouble, but they might not be.\n\nSomething has gone wrong in (10). I conclude that (10) can't be used to\nexpress (9). That is, there's no good interpretation of (10) where those\nguys can be the denotation of *X* in the theory I attributed to Strawman\nin the previous last section. That's to say, the value of *X* can't just\nbe the most salient individual(s) in the context, since the guys are\nbeing made rather salient. And nor can it be anaphoric on previously\nmentioned people, unless they are the subjects of a propositional\nattitude ascription. We'll investigate this exception in what follows.\n\nA natural move at this stage is to adopt what in @Egan2005-EGAEMI we\ncalled the *Speaker Inclusion Constraint* (hereafter SIC). That is, in\nunembedded uses of \"might\" the group *X* always includes the speaker.\nNow the explanation of the problem with (10) is that for the speaker to\nassert the first clause, she must know that the guys are in trouble, but\nif that's the case, and she's in group *X*, then the second clause is\nfalse.\n\nIf the SIC really holds, it looks like it should hold in virtue of the\nmeaning (in some sense of \"meaning\") of \"might\". As a rule, tidy\ngeneralisations like this should be part of semantics, not\nmetasemantics. Compare two possible theories about \"we\". Both theories\nsay that \"we\" is a plural pronoun. One theory goes on to say that it is\npart of the meaning of \"we\" that it picks out a group that includes the\nspeaker. That is, it puts this version of the SIC into the semantics.\nAnother theory says that the SIC for \"we\" is just a nice metasemantic\ngeneralisation. I take it that the second position is very unattractive;\nit's part of the meaning of \"we\" that it picks out a group including the\nspeaker. And I think the relevant point generalises. At least it\ngeneralises as far as another SIC, namely the one that holds for\n\"might\".\n\nSemantic constraints on indexical terms hold, as a rule, for both\nembedded and unembedded uses of those indexicals. You can't use \"she\",\neven as a bound variable, to denote (relative to any variable\nassignment) a male human. There's something badly wrong with *Every\nstudent thinks she will win*, if some students are female and others\nmale. As Michael Glanzberg pointed out to me, complex demonstratives\nheaded by \"this\" have to pick out an object that is in some way\nproximal, and this applies to bound complex demonstratives as well. So\nwe have to use \"that\" rather than \"this\" in sentences like *Every\nconnoisseur remembers that/\\*this first great wine they drank*. For a\nmore familiar example, you can't interpret *O'Leary thinks that I am a\nfool*, as uttered by Daniels, to mean that O'Leary self-ascribes\nfoolishness. In short, it seems that there are three related conclusions\nwe can draw here. First, there are semantic constraints on the possible\nvalues of context-sensitive expressions. Second, any interesting\ngeneralisation about the possible value of a context-sensitive\nexpression is traceable to such a semantic constraint. Third, these\nconstraints remain in force when the expression is used in an attitude\nreport, or as a bound variable.\n\nThe problem for contextualists about \"might\" is that it doesn't behave\nat all this way. The SIC holds for unembedded uses. That implies that it\nis part of the meaning of \"might\". So it should hold for embedded uses.\nBut it does not. Indeed, for many embedded uses of \"might\", a reading\ncompatible with the SIC is simply unavailable. For instance, we can't\ninterpret *Every student thinks that they might have failed* as meaning\nthat every student thinks that, for all I know, they failed. My\nknowledge just doesn't matter; we're talking about those students'\nfears. This all suggests the following argument.\n\n1.  If contextualism is true, then the explanation of the SIC is that it\n    is part of the meaning of \"might\" that the relevant group X includes\n    the speaker.\n\n2.  If it is part of the meaning of \"might\" that the relevant group X\n    includes the speaker, then this must be true for all uses of\n    \"might\", included embedded uses.\n\n3.  When \"might\" is used inside the scope of an attitude ascription, the\n    relevant group need not include the speaker.\n\n4.  So, contextualism is not true.\n\nGlanzberg argued, correctly, that it's no problem for the contextualist\nif, according to their theory, metasemantics was complicated and messy.\nIt's not a problem because, well, metasemantics is complicated and\nmessy. But this cuts both ways. And it is a problem for the\ncontextualist that they have to put the SIC into metasemantics. It's\njust not messy enough to go there.\n\nThere are two objections to this argument (both of which were pressed\nwhen this paper was presented at Arché) that are worth considering\ntogether.\n\n> *Objection One: There are other generalisations that do go into\n> metasemantics*\n>\n> It's very odd, to say the least, to use third-person pronouns to\n> denote oneself. But this doesn't seem to go into the meaning of the\n> pronoun. Relatedly, it is possible to use bound third-person pronouns\n> that take (relative to some variable assignments) oneself as value.\n> For instance, an Australian boy can say \"Whenever an Australian boy\n> goes to the cricket, he cheers for Australia.\" So probably premise 1\n> of the above argument, requiring that generalisations be semantic, is\n> false. If not, premise 2, requiring that semantic constraints on\n> unbound pronouns also constrain bound pronouns is false.\n\n> *Objection Two: The SIC is false*\n>\n> @Egan2005-EGAEMI note that the SIC seems to fail in 'game-playing' and\n> 'advice' contexts. So in a game of hide and seek, where Billy is\n> looking for something Suzy has hidden, if he asks \"Is it in the\n> basement?\", Suzy can truly say \"It might be\", even if she knows it\n> isn't true. And a parent can tell their child \"Wash that strawberry\n> before you eat it; it might be contaminated\" even if the parent knows\n> that the strawberry has been washed.\n\nThe simplest response to the first objection is that the purported\ngeneralisation, a third-person pronoun does not denote the speaker,\nisn't really a universal generalisation at all. It's possible to refer\nto oneself by name; certain people in the news do it on a regular basis.\nFor example, a famous footballer Smith might say \"Smith deserves a pay\nraise\". In such a context, it isn't at all odd (or at least any odder\nthan it already is) to use third-person pronouns, e.g. by continuing the\nabove utterance with \"and if he doesn't get one, he's not going to\nplay\".\n\nThe second objection is a little trickier, but I think it's possible to\nunderstand these utterances as a kind of projection. The speaker is\nspeaking from the perspective of the hearer. This isn't an unattested\nphenomenon. Something like it must be going on when speakers use \"we\" to\ndenote the hearer. Imagine, for instance, a policeman coming across a\nperson staggering out of a pub and saying \"We've had a bit much to drink\nit seems\". The policeman certainly isn't confessing to dereliction of\nduty. Nor is this case sufficient to throw out the idea that \"we\" is a\n*first person* plural pronoun. Rather, the policeman is speaking from\nthe drunk's perspective. I suspect the same thing is going on in both of\nthe examples above.\n\nSo I think both objections can be answered. But neither answer is\ncompletely convincing. And the two responses undermine each other. If we\naccept projection is a widespread phenomenon, then perhaps\nself-denotation with a third person pronoun is a kind of projection. We\nshould then restate the argument, without assuming there's a response to\nthis pair of objections.\n\nTo do so, let's step back from the details of the SIC. What we started\nwith was a simple fact, that (10) can't be used to express (9). That's\nnot threatened by counterexamples to the SIC, and it still needs\nexplanation. The SIC is a proposed semantic explanation, and perhaps, if\nit has counterexamples, it fails. I suspect something like it is\ncorrect, but I don't plan to rely on that suspicion here. That's because\nwe can be independently confident that the explanation here will be\nsemantic, not pragmatic. We can be confident of this because there just\ndoesn't look to be anything like a pragmatic explanation available.\n\nCompare the discussion of third-person pronouns. Even if we can't use\nthird-person pronouns to pick out ourselves (when not speaking\nprojectively), there is an obvious pragmatic explanation for this. We\nhave first-person pronouns available, and if we mean to denote\nourselves, using a first-person pronoun will do so in the clearest\npossible way. Since it is good to be clear, when we pass up the chance\nto use a first-person pronoun, the obvious conclusion for a hearer to\ndraw is that we don't mean to denote ourselves. The details of this\nexplanation could use some filling out, but it at least has the form of\nan explanation. It simply doesn't seem that any such explanation will be\navailable for why (10) can't be used to express (9). It's not that (9)\nisn't a thought that we might be interested in expressing. And it's not\nthat if we wanted to express it, we would have had an obviously\npreferable form of words to (10). It's true that we have the words in\n(9) itself, but (a) they are longer, and (b) on the contextualist view\nwhenever we use an epistemic modal there is some such paraphrase\navailable, a paraphrase that typically does not defeat the acceptability\nof epistemic modals.\n\nIf there isn't a pragmatic explanation of why (10) can't be used to\nexpress (9), then there must be a semantic explanation. But the only\nsemantic explanation that looks plausible from a contextualist\nperspective, is a semantic restriction on *X*. And we know, from\nconsidering the data about embedded epistemic modals, that there is no\nsuch restriction. So we have a problem for contextualism. Slightly more\nformally, we can offer the following argument against orthodox\ncontextualism about epistemic modals.\n\n1.  Whatever acceptability data can't be explained pragmatically must be\n    explained semantically.\n\n2.  There is no pragmatic explanation for why (10) can't be used to\n    express (9).\n\n3.  If 1 and 2 then the meaning of \"might\" must explain why (10) can't\n    be used to express (9).\n\n4.  If the meaning of \"might\" must explain why (10) can't be used to\n    express (9), and contextualism is true, there must be a restriction,\n    provided by the meaning of \"might\" on the relevant group *X* that\n    excludes groups like those guys.\n\n5.  If there is a restriction, provided by the meaning of \"might\" on the\n    relevant group *X* that excludes groups like those guys, then when\n    \"might\" is embedded under an attitude verb, the group *X* still\n    can't be those guys.\n\n6.  In \"Those guys believe that they might be in trouble\", the relevant\n    group *X* just is those guys.\n\n7.  So, contextualism is false.\n\nThis argument is just an argument against contextualism about \"might\".\nIt doesn't obviously generalise very far. It's crucial to the argument\nthat (10) can't be used to express (9), even when the relevant guys are\nmade pretty salient. A similar argument against contextualism about,\nsay, taste claims, would have to start with the premise that a clause\nlike \"but it's tasty\", at the end of a sentence about *a*, couldn't be\nused to express the thought that it is tasty to *a*. And such a premise\nwouldn't be true. As Tamina @Stephenson2007 points out, make a\nparticular dog salient and \"It's tasty\" can express the thought that it\nis tasty to the dog. So I'm rather sceptical that the considerations\nhere generalise to an argument against contextualism about predicates of\npersonal taste.\n\n### Against Moral Relativism\n\nAt first glance there seems to be very little pattern to the way that\ncontextually sensitive terms behave in attitude ascriptions. We can find\nterms, like we, whose denotation inside a belief ascription is not\nparticularly sensitive to the context of the ascribee. So in (11), we is\nnaturally interpreted as denoting the speaker and those around her.\n\n1.  Otto believes that we are fools.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n1.  Vinny the Vulture believes that rotting carcasses are tasty.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n1.  Suzy believes that this kind of dog food is tasty.\n\nOn the other hand, when we use epistemic modals in belief reports, the\nrelevant 'knower' is always the ascribee. Consider, for example, (14).\n\n1.  Jack believes that Smith might be happy.\n\nSo we have a progression of cases, where in (11) the contextually\nsensitive term 'we' has to get its denotation from the context of\nutterance, in (14) the contextually sensitive term 'might' gets its\ndenotation from the context of the ascribee, and (12) and (13) show that\n'tasty' can behave in either of these ways. I've been putting this all\nin terms that will make most sense if we are accepting truth absolutism,\nbut the same points can be made without that assumption if we so desire.\n\nAs I said, at first it might look like there is no pattern here at all.\nBut if we look at other attitudes, we see that there is an interesting\npattern. The way that 'we', 'tasty' and 'might' behave in belief reports\nis just the same as they behave in knowledge reports. We can see this in\nthe following examples.\n\n1.  Otto knows that we are fools.\n\n2.  Vinny the Vulture knows that rotting carcasses are tasty.\n\n3.  Suzy knows that this dog food is tasty.\n\n4.  Jack knows that Smith might be happy.\n\n*t* behaved quite differently in belief and knowledge reports. If that\nwere the case it would be possible in principle to find a passage of the\nform of (15) that's true.\n\n1.  S believes that ... t .... Indeed S knows it. But S doesn't know\n    that ... t ... .\n\nThe problem for contextualism about \"wrong\" is that it is forced to\nviolate this principle. Assume that X is wrong means that X is wrong\nrelative to the standards of some salient group G. We'll leave aside for\nnow the question of whether G is determined by the speaker's context or\nthe assessor's context, as well as the question of whether the sentence\nexpresses a proposition involving G, or a proposition that is true or\nfalse relative to groups. We'll also leave aside the question of just\nwhat it means for something to be wrong relative to the standards. (Does\nit mean that G actually disapproves of it, or would disapprove of it\nunder reflection, or that it doesn't have properties that G wants to\npromote, or something else?) We'll simply assume that there have been\npeople whose standards are different to ours in ways that make a\ndifference for the wrongness of actions. If that isn't the case, we\nhardly have a relativism worthy of the name. It's obviously\ncontroversial just what could be an example of this, but I'll take as my\nexample Jefferson Davis's belief that helping fugitive slaves was wrong.\nIt seems true to say Davis had this belief, so (16) is true.\n\n1.  Davis believed that helping fugitive slaves was wrong.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n1.  Davis knew that helping fugitive slaves was wrong.\n\nNow neither the truth of (16), nor the falsity of (17) is, on its own,\nsufficient to undermine contextualism about \"wrong\". The truth of (16)\nis consistent with the claim that \"wrong\" behaves like \"might\". So in\nattitude ascriptions, what matters is the ascribees context. And the\nfalsity of (17) is consistent with the claim that \"wrong\" behaves like\n\"we\", and (17) is false because what helping fugitive slaves was wrong\nexpresses in our context is false.\n\nRather, the problem is that an adequate account of \"wrong\" has to\naccount both for the truth of (16) and the falsity of (17). And that\ndoesn't seem to be possible. At least it isn't possible without\nsupposing that \"wrong\" behaves differently in knowledge reports and\nbelief reports. And we've seen some reasons above to believe that that's\nnot how context-sensitive terms behave, whether the term is one like\n\"we\", for which an orthodox theory seems best, or like \"might\", for\nwhich a heterodox theory seems best.\n\nI'll end with some objections that I've encountered since I've started\ndiscussing this argument, with my replies to each of them.\n\n> *Objection: This is question-begging against the moral relativist*.\n\nThis is the most common reaction I've heard, but I do find it hard to\nmake sense of. It is hard to see just which premise is question-begging.\nNothing in moral relativism as such prevents us accepting the truth of\n*Davis believed that helping fugitive slaves was wrong*, and nothing in\nmoral relativism prevents us from rejecting *Davis knew that helping\nfugitive slaves was wrong*. There is, I say, a problem with doing both\nof these things, as we should want to do. But if an argument is going to\nbe rejected as question-begging because the other side can't\nsimultaneously accept *all* of its premises, well we won't have many\narguments left to work with.\n\nA little more seriously, the relativist theories that I'm opposing here\nare semantic theories. If we can't reject them because they commit us to\nendorsing sentences that we (the opponents of the view) can see to be\nfalse, then it is hard to know what could count as an argument in\nsemantics. It's no defence of a view to say that its proponents cannot\nsee it is false, if the rest of us can see it.\n\n> *Objection: We would see the knowledge claim (17) is true, if only we\n> didn't have anti-relativist prejudices*.\n\nThis might well be right; it's certainly hard to know when one is\nprejudice free. Perhaps all that's going on is that we don't want to be\ncommitted in any way to saying that it's wrong to help fugitive slaves,\nand we're worried that accepting (17) would, in some way, so commit us.\n\nBut note how much I've done to stack the deck in favour of\npro-relativist intuitions, and to dissipate this worry. The argument is\ncoming at the end of a whole paper defending relativism. Earlier in this\nvery paper I defended some relativist views from arguments using factive\nattitude verbs by noting that it is tricky to state just what factivity\ncomes to. In particular, I noted that we can sometimes say *A knows that\nS* in circumstances where we would not, indeed could not truthfully,\nutter *S*. And I repeated this observation at the start of this section.\nI think I've done as much as possible to (a) overcome anti-relativist\nprejudice, and (b) frame the argument in such a way as to make it as\neasy as possible to accept (17). But even in this frame, I still say we\ncan see that it is false.\n\n> *Objection: This is only an objection to one kind of\n> context-sensitivity in moral terms, the kind we associate with\n> traditional moral relativism. But it doesn't show that moral terms are\n> in no way context-sensitive. We'd expect that they are, since some\n> moral terms are gradable adjectives, and gradable adjectives are\n> context-sensitive*.\n\nThere's a really interesting philosophical position around here. Start\nwith the idea that we should be invariantists, perhaps realists in some\nquite strong sense, about moral comparatives. Perhaps this could be tied\nto the fairly intuitive idea that comparatives are what's crucial to\nmorality. Then say that terms like \"right\" and \"wrong\" pick out, in a\ncontext-sensitive way, points on the moral scale. So some kind of\ncontextualism, presumably orthodox, is right for those terms. This\nposition is immune to the objection given above, because (16) turns out\nto be true, and (17) false, if we interpret \"wrong\" to mean *above the\nactually contextually-salient level of wrongness, on the objectively\ncorrect wrongness scale*.\n\nBut I think a similar pair of examples show that this won't work. Assume\nthat we're talking about various people's charitable giving in a context\nwhere we don't hold people to super-high standards. So the charitable\nactions of, say, Bill Gates count as laudable in our circumstances. (I\nassume that on the merits Gates's donations are for the good;\ndetermining whether this is true is well outside the scope of this\npaper.) Now consider a philosopher, call him Peter, who doesn't believe\nin the moral supererogatory, so he thinks anything less than the best\nyou can do is morally wrong. It seems to me that, as uttered in our\ncontext, (18) expresses a truth and (19) a falsehood.\n\n1.  Peter believes that Bill Gates's level of charitable donation is\n    wrong.\n\n2.  Peter knows that Bill Gates's level of charitable donation is wrong.\n\nAnd I don't think there's a good contextualist explanation for this pair\nof judgments. If \"wrong\" was just a simple context-sensitive term in the\nway suggested, then (18) should be false, because Peter doesn't believe\nthat Bill Gates's level of charitable donations do rise to the level of\nwrongness that is, as it happens, is salient in our context. But\nintuitively, (18) is true.\n\nThe same kind of objection can be raised to a more prominent kind of\ntheory that takes a certain kind of normative standard to be set by\ncontext, namely classical contextualism about \"knows\". Assume it is\ncommon ground that George has excellent, but not irrefutable, evidence\nthat he has hands. Assume also that we're in a low standards context for\nknowledge. And assume that René thinks knowledge requires objective\ncertainty. Then it seems that we can truly say (20), but not (21).\n\n1.  René believes that George doesn't know he has hands.\n\n2.  René knows that George doesn't know he has hands.\n\nAgain, the pattern here is very hard to explain on any kind of\ncontextualist theory, be it orthodox or heterodox\n\n> *Objection: Normative terms might be sui generis. Perhaps they are the\n> only counterexamples to the pattern in (15)*.\n\nAnything could be the exception to any rule we like. But it's bad\npractice to assume that we have an exception on our hands. If we\nheterodox theorists simply responded to von Fintel and Gillies' argument\nfrom factive verbs by saying that we had an exception to a general\npattern here, we would, quite rightly, not be taken seriously.\nContextualists and relativists about normative terms should be held to\nthe same standard.\n\n> *Objection: Relativism does have counterintuitive consequences, but\n> all theories have some counterintuitive consequences. Arguably\n> everyone is going to have to accept some kind of error theory, and\n> this is a relatively harmless kind of error to attribute to the folk*.\n\nIf we were convinced, perhaps by one or other of the contemporary\ndevelopments of Mackie's argument from queerness [@Mackie1977], that no\nnon-relativistic moral theory is possible (apart from a Mackie-style\nmoral error theory), that would be an interesting argument for moral\nrelativism. Certainly I'd be more willing to accept that (16) and (17)\ndon't have the same kind of context-sensitivity than I would be to\naccept that, say, it's not wrong to torture babies.\n\nIt is well beyond the scope of this paper to adjudicate such debates in\nany detail, but I am a little sceptical that we will ever face such a\nchoice. Generalising wildly, most of the time our choice is between (a)\naccepting a moral error theory, (b) accepting some odd semantic\nconsequences, as outlined here, or (c) rejecting some somewhat plausible\nclaim about the nature of moral judgment, such as motivational\ninternalism. (Without internalism there's nothing to make moral\nproperties \"queer\" in Mackie's sense, for example.) Arguments that\npresent a trilemma such as this deserve to be judged on their merits,\nbut my feeling is that we should normally take option (c). That's not to\nsay this objection is obviously flawed, or that the argument I've\noffered is a knock-down refutation of relativism. It clearly is not. But\nI think it is a challenge that moral relativists and contextualists\nshould face up to.\n",
