He didn't\nparticipate in the one volume of papers on his work published in his\nlifetime (*Reality and Humean Supervenience*, Rowman and Littlefield\n2001). He rarely contributed to festschrifts for others, in recent\ndecades only contributing papers to volumes in honour of his very\nclosest friends (David Armstrong and Hugh Mellor). I haven't done a\nsystematic study of this, but my casual reading suggests he didn't often\nrefer to papers published in festschrifts either. More generally, he\nstrongly favoured published in journals with blind review to publishing\nin edited volumes of solicited papers.\n\nSo if there was to be a festschrift for David Lewis, as there surely\nshould be, it should be one put together just the way *Lewisian Themes*\nwas. Most of the papers for it were selected by blind refereeing, not by\ninviting the usual suspects. (And the result was that several young\nphilosophers, even graduate students, are represented in the\ncollection.) The festschrift did not start life as this volume, but as\nan edition of a journal. And not just any journal, but the journal that\nLewis's work most often graced: the *Australasian Journal of\nPhilosophy*. This volume reprints the papers from that issue, and adds\nfour more papers that were left out for space considerations.\n\nThe result is a marvellous collection that reflects Lewis's work in both\nits quality and its breadth. Given the amount of material herein, I can\ndo little more than summarise the papers and present a few reflections\non what some of them tell us about the future directions for Lewisian\nphilosophy. Here is the list of topics covered, each of which is\nfollowed in parentheses by the names of the authors who address that\ntopic.\n\n-   Quantum Mechanics (David Lewis; David Papineau)\n\n-   Properties (Andy Egan; Josh Parsons)\n\n-   Truth in Fiction (Richard Hanley; Jim Mackenzie)\n\n-   Ramseyan Humility (Rae Langton; Jonathan Schaffer)\n\n-   Chance (Adam Elga; Ned Hall)\n\n-   Mental Content (Robert Stalnaker; Barry Taylor; Alan Hájek and\n    Philip Pettit)\n\n-   Modal Realism (Kris McDaniel; Barry Taylor; Max Cresswell)\n\n-   Counterpart Theory and Essentialism (Max Cresswell; L. A. Paul)\n\n-   Similarity (Barry Taylor; David Vander Laan)\n\n-   Holes (Roberto Casati and Achille Varzi)\n\n-   Truth (Marian David)\n\n-   Vagueness (Gideon Rosen and Nicholas J. J. Smith)\n\nThe breadth of the papers here is astounding. Three of the papers\n(Papineau, Langton and Schaffer) respond to material of Lewis's that was\nonly published posthumously. Summaries of David Lewis's work normally\nstart by mentioning his modal realism, but this presents a somewhat\ndistorted picture of his interests and importance. The list here is a\nbetter guide to the range of Lewis's work. (Though as the editors note,\nit is quite incomplete because it leaves out Lewis's work on materialism\nand on set theory and mereology , not to mention his work on\nconditionals and on value theory and many other topics.)\n\nThe only paper directly about modal realism is McDaniel's interesting\npaper on how we might formulate and defend a version of modal realism\nthat allows worlds to overlap. Barry Taylor's paper develops some\nconsiderations about simplicity that suggest a worry for Lewis's\nargument against linguistic ersatzism: in particular he argues against\nthe existence of alien universals. And Max Cresswell formulates his\ndiscussion of counterpart theory using modal realist language. And\nthat's it for the discussion of modal realism, which seems about right\ngiven its relative importance in Lewis's overall picture.\n\nMany of the papers accept the broad outlines of Lewis's views, but\nsuggest alternative ways of developing the details. For instance, Andy\nEgan's paper \"Second Order Predication and the Metaphysics of\nProperties\" discusses Lewis's view that properties are sets of\nindividuals. Egan argues that Lewis should instead have said that\nproperties are functions from worlds to sets of individuals in that\nworld. You might think that these two views are equivalent. Let *f* be a\nfunction that Egan calls a property, and consider the set {*x*: for some\nworld *w*, *x* ∈ *f*(*w*)}. Why wouldn't that set be a Lewis-style\nproperty? Well, it would be if no object is in more than one world.\nIsn't that true on Lewis's metaphysics? Not quite. Most ordinary\nindividuals are in one world only, but *properties* are in multiple\nworlds. If the property *being red* has some property, say *being\ninstantiated*, in some worlds but not others, should it be a member of\nthe property *being instantiated* or not? Egan argues, persuasively,\nthat Lewis can give no good answer to this question. But on the view\nthat properties are functions, we can say that the function that we\nidentify with the property *being instantiated* maps worlds onto a set\nthat includes *being red* in worlds where there are red things, and a\nset that does not include it in worlds where there are no red things. So\nthis looks like a nice fix to a technical problem for Lewis. Egan goes\non to argue that the change undermines some of Lewis's arguments against\nendurantism and modal overlap.\n\nNed Hall discusses Lewis's widely influential theory of objective\nchance. There are two disputes running through Hall's paper: the dispute\nbetween reductionists and anti-reductionists about chance, and the\ndispute between the old and new versions of the Principal Principle,\npresented here as (O) and (N).\n\n\\(O\\) C~0~(A \\| E & ch~t~(A) = x) = x\n\n\\(N\\) C~0~(A \\| HL) = ch~t~(A \\| L)\n\nHere C~0~ is an initial credence function of a rational agent, ch~t~ is\nthe chance function at t, H is the history of the world to t, L is the\nconjunction of the laws, and E is any evidence that is 'admissible' with\nrespect to A at t. (Evidence is admissible, roughly, if it doesn't\nprovide any more information about A than we get from knowing its\nchance.) Lewis thought it was a cost of his reductionist position that\nhe was forced to give up (O) and retreat to (N). Hall suggests that it\nisn't a cost, it is really something we could have derived all along.\nHall's reasoning is a little hard to follow here. He shows elegantly\nthat if the reductionist agrees to treat the chance function as an\nexpert function, then she should accept (N) rather than (O). (Roughly\nspeaking, to treat a function as an expert function is, as Hall says on\npage 101, to consider its opinion so epistemically superior to yours\nthat you are disposed to defer to it. Before we can give a formal\nstatement of this we need to make it precise, which may not be trivial.\nOne of the important innovations of Hall's paper is to clarify some\nimportantly distinct ways of making it precise, in particular\ndistinguishing the cases where the expert is better informed than you\nfrom the case where the expert is a better judge of evidence than you.)\nBut it is not clear how showing that the reductionist is forced to\naccept (N) rather than (O), shows that it isn't a *cost* of reductionism\nthat it is incompatible with (O).\n\nHall makes two nice points about how (N) stands with respect to the\nreductionist/anti‑reductionist debate. First, he notes that it isn't\nclear in general how reductionists can derive (N), i.e. derive the claim\nthat the chance function *is* an expert function, from their general\nprinciples. Lewis often touted it as a virtue of reductionism that such\na derivation seems possible, but Hall suggests that there will be\nproblems with the details here. Lewis's optimism rested on cases where\nthere was a close connection between chance and limiting relative\nfrequency, but this is not the only kind of case. Hall argues,\npersuasively, that this part of the reductionist program will have\ndifficulties with cases where the chance of an F being a G varies\ncontinuously with some magnitude *m* of the F (say its mass), and the\nproposition A concerns whether a particular object *a*, which is an *F*\nsuch that *m*(*a*) is unique, is also a G. (The general project of\ntrying to incorporate continuously variable quantities, like masses,\ninto Lewis's metaphysics appears to be very difficult, and there could\nbe some very interesting philosophical discoveries to be made in this\nfield.) Second, Hall notes that it is not as hard for the\nanti‑reductionist to explain (N) as Lewis suggests. To be sure, the\nanti-reductionist can't derive (N) from, say, metaphysical necessities\nand logic. But we know that reasonable principles of inductive\nrationality won't follow merely from metaphysical necessities and logic;\nin addition, we need a number of substantive synthetic principles. There\nis no reason why (N), or something that entails (N), cannot be among\nthese.\n\nThe difficulty Lewis imagines for the anti-reductionist here arises\nlargely from an insufficient attention to epistemology. Lewis never took\nepistemology (at least informal epistemology) as seriously as he took\nmetaphysics, philosophy of mind, or philosophy of language, and\noccasionally this shows up in the papers here. Jonathan Schaffer's paper\n\"Quiddistic Knowledge\" argues that there is no plausible epistemological\ntheory that grounds Lewis's claim in \"Ramseyan Humility\" that \"we are\nirredemiably ignorant about the identities of the fundamental\nproperties.\" And Robert Stalnaker in \"Lewis on Intentionality\" argues\nthat Lewis's content internalism derives from an implausible commitment\nto epistemological internalism.\n\nThere are of course many more good ideas throughout this volume. For\nexample, Marian David has a thorough, and thoroughly convincing,\nresponse to Lewis's argument that the correspondence theory of truth is\nnot a competitor to the redundancy theory of truth. Max Cresswell\nprovides a few reasons for thinking that the counterpart relation has to\nbe an equivalence relation, in which case we may as well do without\ncounterpart theory. (Cresswell's paper and the recent paper on a similar\ntopic by Michael Fara and Timothy Williamson, \"Counterparts and\nActuality\", *Mind* 114: 1-30, complement each other nicely, and should\nbe required reading for anyone interested in debates about counterpart\ntheory.) Alan Hájek and Philip Pettit argue that Lewis's argument\nagainst the view that desires are beliefs about what is good assumes\nthat goodness is not an 'indexical' property, and that this might fail\nif what is good is partially a function of, say, our evidence, as on the\nview that what is good is what maximises *expected* utility. And there\nare many more gems like these.\n\nIt is a great compliment to Lewis's style as a philosopher that, as we\nsee in this collection, Lewis amassed a great number of admirers who\nthought the best way to honour his work was to criticise it in every way\nimaginable. It is sad to stop and think how much we would have learned\nfrom hearing Lewis's responses.\n",
