Some of its value is instrumental. Having\npeople around with diverse beliefs, or customs, or tastes, can expand\nour horizons and potentially raise to salience some potential true\nbeliefs, useful customs or apt tastes. Even diversity of error can be\nuseful. Seeing other people fall away from the true and the useful in\ndistinctive ways can immunise us against similar errors. And there are a\nvariety of pleasant interactions, not least philosophical exchange, that\nwouldn't be possible unless some kinds of diversity existed. Diversity\nmay also have intrinsic value. It may be that a society with diverse\nviews, customs and tastes is simply thereby a better society. But we\nwill mostly focus on diversity's instrumental value here.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophical Perspectives_ 18: 45-52.\n</aside>\n\nWe think that what is true of these common types of diversity is also\ntrue of moral diversity. By moral diversity we mean not only diversity\nof moral views, though that is no doubt valuable, but diversity of moral\nbehaviour. In a morally diverse society, at least some people will not\nconform as tightly to moral norms as others. In short, there will be\nsome wrongdoers. To be sure, moral diversity has some costs, and too\nmuch of it is undoubtedly a bad thing. Having rapists and murderers adds\nto moral diversity (assuming, as we do, that most people are basically\nmoral) but not in a way that is particularly valuable. Still, smaller\namounts of moral diversity may be valuable, all things considered. It\nseems particularly clear that moral diversity within a subgroup has\nvalue, but sometimes society as a whole is better off for being morally\ndiverse. Let us consider some examples.\n\nMany violations of etiquette are not moral transgressions. Eating\nasparagus spears with one's fork is not sinful, just poor form. But more\nextreme violations may be sinful. Hurtful use of racial epithets, for\nexample, is clearly immoral as well as a breach of etiquette. Even use\nof language that causes not hurt, but strong discomfort, may be morally\nwrong. Someone who uses an offensive term in polite company, say at a\ndinner party or in a professional philosophical forum, may be doing the\nwrong thing. But having the wrongdoer around may have valuable\nconsequences. For example, they generate stories that can be told, to\ngreat amusement, at subsequent dinner parties. They also prompt us to\nreconsider the basis for the standards we ourselves adopt in such\nmatters. The reconsideration may cause us to abandon useless practices,\nand it may reinforce useful practices. These benefits seem to outweigh\nthe disutility of the discomfort felt by those in attendance when the\nfateful word drops from the speaker's lips. These side benefits do not\nmake the original action morally permissible. Indeed, it is precisely\nbecause the action is not morally permissible that the benefits accrue.\n\nWhile we think that case is one of valuable moral diversity, some may\nquestion the *immorality* of the act in question. So let us try a more\nclearly immoral case: the mostly harmless prankster. Sam is a\npie-thrower. Sam doesn't just throw pies at the rich and infamous. No,\nSam's pies land on common folk like you and I, often for no reason\nbeyond Sam's amusement. Causing gratuitous harm for one's own amusement\nis immoral. And a pie in the face, while better than a poke in the eye\nwith a burnt stick, is harmful. But it may, in some circumstances, have\nside benefits. There will be the (guilty) pleasure occasioned in the\nunharmed bystanders, though it would be wrong to put too much weight on\nthat. Other more significant benefits may accrue if Sam's society is\notherwise saintly. Sam's existence will prompt people to take some\nsimple, and worthwhile, precautions against perpetrators of such\nattacks. Even if society currently contains no malfeasants, such\nprecautions will be useful against future wrongdoers. This benefit will\nincrease if Sam graduates from pie-throwing to more varied pranks. (As\nmay the entertainment value of Sam's pranks.) Many computer hackers\nperform just this function in the present world. Malicious hackers on\nthe whole cause more harm than good. But other hackers, who hack without\ngratuitously harming, provide a protective benefit by informing us of\nour weaknesses. These are the pie-throwers of the virtual world. Sam's\nactions have other benefits. If Sam's pranks are harmless enough, some\nwill mistakenly think that they are morally acceptable, and we can have\nenjoyable, valuable, philosophical discussions with them. (Note that\nthis benefit also increases if Sam varies the pranks.) The upshot is\nthat Sam's pranks can make the world a better place, all things\nconsidered, despite being immoral. Indeed, in some ways they make the\nworld a better place *because* they are immoral.\n\nThe philosophical point, or points, here may be familiar. One point\ncertainly *is* familiar: we have here an example of a Moorean organic\nunity. The goodness of the whole is no simple function of the goodness\nof the parts. It might be thought that this follows simply from the\nfamiliar counterexamples to utilitarianism, and that our examples have\nno more philosophical interest than those old counterexamples. Both of\nthese thoughts would be mistaken.\n\nThe familiar counterexamples we have in mind include, for example, the\ncase of the doctor who kills a healthy patient to harvest her organs, or\nthe judge who executes an innocent man to prevent a riot. Importantly,\nthose examples do not refute consequentialism in general, but only a\nversion of consequentialism that adopts a particular kind of reductive\nanalysis of the good. The details of the analysis won't matter here, but\nit may be an analysis of goodness in terms on happiness, or preference\nsatisfaction. If we give up the reductive analysis of goodness, we can\nsay that the doctor and the judge do not make for a better society. A\nfamiliar heuristic supports that claim. (We take no stand here on\nwhether this heuristic can be turned into an analysis.) Behind the\nRawlsian veil of ignorance, we would prefer that there not be such\ndoctors or judges in society. We think that most of us would agree, even\nin full appreciation of the possibility that we will be saved by the\ndoctor, or possibly the judge. On the other hand, we think we'd prefer a\nsociety with the occasional boorish dinner guest, or a rare pie-thrower,\nto a society of moral saints. We say this in full appreciation of the\npossibility that we may get a pie in the face for our troubles. Possibly\nif we *knew* we would be the pie-throwee we would change our minds, but\nfortunately pies cannot penetrate the veil of ignorance.\n\nAlthough it isn't much discussed in the literature, we think this form\nof consequentialism is interesting for several reasons beyond its\ncapacity to avoid counterexamples. For one thing, it is not easy to say\nwhether this counts as an agent-neutral ethical theory. On the one hand,\nwe can say what everyone should do in neutral terms: for each person it\nis better if they do things that create a better world from the\nperspective of those behind the veil of ignorance. On the other hand\nthis rule leads to obligations on agents that do not seem at all\nneutral. From behind the veil of ignorance we'd prefer that parents love\ntheir children and hence privilege their interests, and that they love\nthem because they are their children not because this creates a better\nworld, so parents end up with a special obligation to their children.\nHaving this much (or more importantly this *little*) neutrality in a\nmoral theory sounds quite plausible to us, and although we won't develop\nthe point here there is possibly an attractive answer to the 'nearest\nand dearest' objection to consequentialism [@Jackson1991]. More\ngenerally, because we have preferences from behind the veil of ignorance\nabout *why* people act and not just about *how* they act -- we prefer\nfor instance that people visit sick friends in hospital because they are\nfriends not because of an abstract sense of duty -- this form of\nconsequentialism is not particularly vulnerable to objections that claim\nconsequentialists pay too little attention to motives.\n\nSo we think a consequentialist can avoid the standard objections to\nutilitarianism by being less ambitious and not trying to provide a\nreductive analysis of goodness. The most natural retreat is to behind\nthe veil of ignorance, but our examples can reach even there. This is\nfar from the only interesting consequence of the examples.\n\n### The Good, the Right, and the Saintly\n\nWe think that the cases of the curser and the pie-thrower are examples\nof situations in which (a) an agent ought not to $\\varphi$, and (b) it's\nbest that the agent *does* $\\varphi$. Our judgements about the cases are\nnot based on any theoretical analysis of the right and the good. They're\nsimply intuitions about cases---it just seems to us that the right thing\nto say about the pie thrower is that she ought not to do what she does,\nbut that it's still best if she does it. To the extent that these\nintuitions are puzzling or theoretically problematic (and we think that\nthey are at least a little bit puzzling, and at least potentially\nproblematic), it's open to us to reject one or the other intuition about\nthe cases, and either deny that the curser and the pie thrower ought not\nto curse or throw pies, or deny that it's best that they *do* curse and\nthrow pies. This is an option, but we think it's not a very attractive\none. Suppose that instead we take the intuitions at face value, and\naccept our judgements about the cases. What follows?\n\nOur analysis of the examples is incompatible with two attractive views\nabout the connection between *goodness* (that is, the property of\nthings---in particular worlds---in virtue of which some of them stand in\nthe *better than* relation to others) and *rightness*, and between\ngoodness and good character:\n\n1.  It's better if everyone does what's right.\n2.  It's better if everyone has good character.[^1]\n\nNow, neither of these will do as a philosophical thesis. But it's\nprobably not worth spending the time and effort on patching them up,\nsince even the patched-up versions will be false.\n\nIf the pie-thrower ought not to throw her pies, but it's nonetheless\nbest that she does, no patched-up version of (1) that captures the\nintuition behind it can be right. Any patched-up version of (1) will\nstill be claiming that there's a very tight connection between what it\nwould be *right* for us to do (what we *ought* to do) and what it would\nbe *best* for us to do. Any plausible elaboration on (1) will include a\ncommitment to the thesis that, if we ought not to do something, then\nit's best if we don't do it. But if our analyses of the cases of the\ncurser and the pie-thrower are right, then these are counterexamples.\n\nWhat about (2)? Well, it's *not* better if the cursing dinner guest has\ngood character. What happens if we suppose that the curser *does* have\ngood character? One of two things: (i) He'll no longer curse at dinner\nparties, and we'll lose the benefits that come from his cursing. This\nwould be bad. (ii) He'll still curse at dinner parties, but he'll be\ncursing in a *studied* way. He'll be cursing because he's seen that\nthings will be better if *somebody* uses foul language in inappropriate\ncircumstances, and he's taken it upon himself to fill the unfilled\nfunctional role. This would also be bad. This sort of *studied* bad\nconduct doesn't have the same value as bad conduct that springs from bad\ncharacter. Here is some evidence for this: We value the curser's\nbreaching of societal norms, even though he ought not to do it. Were we\nto *find out* that every expletive had been *studied*, produced either\nto produce these important social goods, or to create a familiar bad-boy\nimage, we would *stop* valuing his breachings of the moral order. They\nwould, instead, become merely tiresome and annoying. Since we value\nspontaneous cursings which are products of less-than-optimal character,\nbut we do *not* value studied cursings which are products of exemplary\ncharacter, it's very plausible to conclude (though admittedly not quite\nmandatory) that the spontaneous curses are much more valuable than the\nstudied ones. We're inclined to say, in fact, that while having a few\n*spontaneous* cursers around makes things better, having *studied*\ncursers around makes things worse. Since you have to have\nless-than-perfect character in order to be a spontaneous curser, it\nfollows that you can't get the benefits of having cursers around without\nhaving some people with less-than-perfect character around. And since\nit's better to have the cursers than not, it's better to have some\npeople with less-than-perfect character around than not. This will be\nincompatible with almost any plausible way of cashing out (2).[^2]\n\n### A Problem about Quantifier Scope?\n\nBut isn't there a sense in which (for example) the pie-thrower *ought*\nto throw his pies? After all, if nobody was throwing pies, we might\nthink to ourselves, \"gosh, it would be better if there were a few---not\nmany, but a few---pie throwers around\". Then it would be natural to\nconclude, \"somebody ought to start throwing pies at strangers\". And then\nit would be natural to infer that at least the first person to start\nthrowing pies at strangers would be doing what they ought. It would be\nnatural, but it would be wrong. The plausible reading of \"someone ought\nto start throwing pies at strangers\" is, \"it ought to be that somebody\nstarts throwing pies at strangers\", not, \"there's somebody out there\nsuch that they ought to start throwing pies at strangers\". So we haven't\ngotten anybody a moral license to throw pies yet. And in fact it's very\nplausible that we ought to understand assertions that *it ought to be\nthat P* as claiming that it would be *better* if it were the case that\nP; that is, as making claims about what would be *good*, not about what\nwould be *right*.\n\nThere's a puzzle about what to make of cases where we're inclined to say\nthat it ought to be that somebody $\\varphi$s---that is, that somebody\nought to $\\varphi$; but also that there's nobody such that *they* ought\nto $\\varphi$---in fact, that everybody is such that they ought *not* to\n$\\varphi$.[^3] Maybe the fact that our intuitions about the examples\ngive rise to these kinds of puzzling cases is evidence that one or the\nother of our intuitions ought to be rejected. The move we suggested\nabove is that the reason this seems so puzzling is that we've been\npunning on \"ought\". The \"ought\" in \"somebody ought to start throwing\npies\" doesn't have anything much to do with what moral obligations\nanybody has---doesn't have anything much to do with what's *right*---but\nhas a great deal to do with what's *good*. And if that's the case, then\nall we have is more evidence against the tight connection between the\nright and the good: it would be better if somebody started throwing\npies, but everybody has a moral obligation not to. So it would be better\nif somebody did what they oughtn't.\n\n### Value, Desire and Advice\n\nAlthough the \"ought\" in \"somebody ought to throw pies\" has little to do\nwith what's *right*, it might have a lot to do with what we find\ndesirable. And this will cause problems for some familiar meta-ethical\ntheories. Quite naturally, Jack does not desire to throw pies at\nstrangers for amusement in the actual world. Jack's a very civic minded\nfellow in that respect. In fact, his concern for others goes deeper than\nthat. He'd be quite prepared to risk his body for the sake of his fellow\ncitizens. As it turns out, he's been a volunteer fire fighter for years\nnow. And Jack likes to think that if need be, he would be prepared, to\nuse an old fashioned phrase, to risk his soul for the community. He\nhopes he would be morally depraved if what the society needed was\ndepravity. Jack agrees with the discussion of character in section 2, so\nhe hopes that when society needs a pie-thrower, he will step up with the\nplate, and do so directly because he wants to throw pies at innocent\nbystanders. Letting C stand for the circumstances described above, where\nit would be good for there to be more wrongdoing, Jack's position can be\nsummarised by saying that he desires that in C he desires that *he*\nthrows pies at innocents.\n\nDoes this all mean Jack values his throwing pies at innocents in C? Not\nnecessarily. Does it mean that if we were all like Jack, and we are\nsubjectivists about what is right, it would be right to throw pies at\ninnocents in C? Definitely not. David @Lewis1989b equates what we value\nwith what we desire to desire.[^4] And he equates what is valuable with\nwhat we value. The text is not transparent, but it seems Lewis wants\n*valuable* to subsume both what we call the 'right' and the 'good'. And\nthis he cannot have. Assume that everyone in Jack's community desires to\n(*de se*) desire that (s)he throw pies at innocents in C. That does not\nmake it right that pies are thrown at innocents. We take no stand here\non whether the flaw is in the equation of personal value with\nsecond-order desire, or in the reduction of both rightness and goodness\nto personal value, but there is a problem for Lewis's dispositional\ntheory of value.[^5]\n\nThis point generalises to cause difficulties for several dispositional\ntheories of value. For example, Michael @Smith1994 holds that right\nactions are what our perfectly rational selves would advise us to do.\nThis assumes that when the good and the right come apart, our perfectly\nrational selves would choose the right over the good. And it's far from\nclear that Smith has the resources to argue for this assumption. Smith's\nargument that our perfectly rational selves will advise us to do what is\nright relies on his earlier argument that anyone who does not do what\nshe judges to be *right* is practically irrational, unlike presumably\nour perfectly rational selves. And the main argument for that principle\nis that it is the best explanation of why actually good people are\nmotivated to do what they judge to be right, even when they change their\njudgements about what is right. But now we should be able to see that\nthere's an alternative explanation available. Actually good people might\nbe motivated to do what they judge to be *good* rather than *right*. We\nhave seen no reason to believe that the right and the good actually come\n*radically* apart, so this is just as good an explanation of the\nbehaviour actual moral agents as Smith's explanation. So for all Smith\nhas argued, one might judge $\\varphi$ing to be right, also judge it not\nto be good, hence be not motivated to $\\varphi$, and not be practically\nirrational. Indeed, our perfectly rational self might be just like\nthis.[^6] Hence we cannot rely on our perfectly rational self to be a\nbarometer of what is right, as opposed to what is good.\n\n[^1]: Proposition (2) is quite a natural position to hold if one is trying to\n    capture the insights of virtue ethics in a consequentialist\n    framework, as in @Driver2001 or @Hurka2001. But if we take 'better'\n    in a more neutral way, so (2) does not mean that there are better\n    consequences if everyone has good character, but simply that the\n    world is a better place if this is so, even if this has few\n    consequences, or even negative consequences, then it will be a\n    position common to most virtue ethicists.\n\n[^2]: Specifically, it will be incompatible with any *maximizing*\n    version of (2). There are 'threshold' versions of (2) that don't\n    fall afoul of this kind of problem because they don't claim it would\n    be best for everyone to have *perfect* character, but only that it\n    would be best for everyone to have *pretty good* character, or at\n    least for nobody to have *really bad* character.\n\n[^3]: It's actually the second part that makes it puzzling. Compare the\n    familiar and unproblematic situation in which we ought to give you a\n    horse, but there's no horse such that we ought to give you *that*\n    one, and the more troubling situation in which we ought to give you\n    a horse, but every horse is such that we ought *not* to give you\n    that one.\n\n[^4]: More precisely, with what we desire to desire in circumstances of\n    appropriate imaginative acquaintance. We can suppose that Jack, and\n    everyone else under discussion in this paragraph, is suitably\n    imaginatively acquainted with the salient situations. Jack knows\n    full well what it is like to get a pie in the face.\n\n[^5]: Someone might think it obvious that Lewisian value can't be used\n    in an analysis of both rightness and goodness, since it is *one*\n    concept and we are analysing *two* concepts. But Lewisian value\n    bifurcates in a way that one might think it is suitable for\n    analysing both rightness and goodness. Since there are both *de\n    dicto* and *de se* desires, one can easily draw out both *de dicto*\n    and *de se* values. And it is *prima facie* plausible that the *de\n    dicto* values correspond to what is good, and the *de se* values to\n    what is right. Indeed, given a weak version of consequentialism\n    where these two can be guaranteed to not directly conflict, this\n    correspondence may well hold. But we think the pie-thrower threatens\n    even those consequentialists. The net philosophical conclusion is\n    that the pie-thrower is a problem for Lewis's meta-ethics, but only\n    because (a) she is a problem for Lewis's consequentialism, and,\n    surprisingly, (b) Lewis's meta-ethics depends on his\n    consequentialism being at least roughly right.\n\n[^6]: We have glossed over a technical point here that is irrelevant to\n    the current discussion. What matters is not whether our perfectly\n    rational selves are motivated to $\\varphi$, it matters whether they\n    desire that we $\\varphi$, and hence whether they are motivated to\n    advise us to $\\varphi$. Keeping this point clear matters for all\n    sorts of purposes, but not we think the present one.\n",
