It is argued that Keynes, like Wittgenstein, moved from an atomic Cartesian individualism to a more conventionalist, intersubjective philosophy. It is sometimes argued this was caused by Wittgenstein's concurrent conversion. Further, it is argued that recognising this shift is important for understanding Keynes's later economics. In this paper I argue that the evidence adduced for these theses is insubstantial, and other available evidence contradicts their claims.\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndate: 01-01-2001\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: witters.jpg\ncitation: false\ncategories:\n  - history of analytic\n  - economics\n  - unpublished\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: TRUE\n---\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nThree recent books [@Davis1994; @Bateman1996; @Coates1996] have argued\nthat the philosophy behind Keynes's later economics (in particular the\n*General Theory*) is closer to Wittgenstein's post Tractarian theorising\nthan to his early philosophy as expressed in his *Treatise on\nProbability*.[^1] If Keynes did follow Wittgenstein in the ways\nsuggested it would represent a substantial change from his early\nneoplatonist epistemology. In this paper I argue that the evidence for\nthis thesis is insubstantial, and the best explanation of the evidence\nis that Keynes's philosophical views remained substantially unchanged.\n\n<aside>\nPicture by [Bernhard Ellefsen](https://www.flickr.com/photos/10903487@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/25c9cca0-adc4-45f2-9a9c-61d4694d71d9).\n</aside>\n\nThere are three reasons for being interested in this question. The first\nis that it is worthwhile getting the views of a thinker as important as\nKeynes right. The second is that it would be mildly unfortunate for\nthose of us attracted to Keynes's epistemology to find out that it was\neventually rejected by its creator[^2]. Most importantly, all parties\nagree that Keynes thought his philosophical theories had substantial\nconsequences for economic theory. It is a little unusual for\nphilosophical theories to have practical consequences; if one is claimed\nto it is worthwhile identifying and evaluating the claim.\n\nSection 2 examines Bateman's claim that Keynes abandoned the foundations\nof his early theory of probability. Bateman's arguments turn, it seems,\non an equivocation between different meanings of 'Platonism'. On some\ninterpretations the arguments are sound but don't show what Bateman\nwants, on all others they are unsound. Section 3 looks at the\nconventionalist, intersubjective theory of probability Bateman and Davis\nclaim Keynes adopted after abandoning his early objective theory. As\nthey express it the theory's coherence is dubious; I show how it might\nbe made more plausible. Nevertheless, there is little to show that\nKeynes adopted it. The only time he talks about conventions is in the\ncontext of speculative markets and in these contexts a conventionalist\ntheory will give the same results as an objectivist theory.\n\nSection 4 looks at Coates's quite different arguments for an influence\nfrom Wittgenstein to Keynes. Part of the problem with Coates's argument\nis that the textual evidence he presents is capable of several readings;\nindeed competing interpretations of the pages he uses exist. A bigger\nproblem is that even when he has shown a change in Keynes's views\noccurred, he immediately infers the change was at the foundations of\nKeynes's beliefs. Section 5 notes one rather important point of\nWittgenstein's of which Keynes seemed to take no notice, leading to an\nerror in the *General Theory*. This should cast doubt on the claim that\nKeynes's later philosophy, indeed later economics, was based on theories\nof Wittgenstein.\n\n### Bateman's Case for Change\n\nA brief biographical sketch of Keynes is in order to frame the following\ndiscussions, though I expect most readers are familiar with the broad\noutlines[^3]. Keynes arrived as an undergraduate at Cambridge in 1902\nand was based there for the rest of his life. For the next six years he\nlargely studied philosophy under the influence of Moore and Russell. In\n1907 he (unsuccessfully) submitted his theory of probability as a\nfellowship dissertation; this was successfully resubmitted the following\nyear. His plans to make a book of this were interrupted by work on\nIndian finance, the war and its aftermath. It appeared as *Treatise on\nProbability* (hereafter, *TP*) in [-@Keynes1921], after substantial work\non it in 1920. Modern subjectivist theories of probability, generally\nknown as Bayesian theories, first appeared in critical reviews of this\nbook (e.g. @Borel1924, @RamseyTruthProb). After leaving philosophy for\nmany years, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929, and subsequently\nhad many discussions with Keynes. In Keynes's *General Theory*\n(hereafter, *GT*) of [-@Keynes1936] and in some of the ensuing debate,\nKeynes referred to some distinctive elements of the *TP*, leading some\ninterpreters to suspect that there was a theoretical link between his\nearly philosophy and his later economics.\n\nThere are two distinctive elements of Keynes's early theory of\nprobability for our purposes. The first is its objectivism. Keynes held\nthe probability of *p* given *h* is the degree of *reasonable* belief in\n*p* on evidence *h*, or, as @Carnap1950 put it, the degree of\nconfirmation of *p* by *h*. These degrees are determined by logic;\nKeynes held that there was a partial entailment relation between *p* and\n*h*, of which the ordinary entailment relation (then thought to have\nbeen given its best exposition by Russell and Whitehead) was just a\nlimiting case. And these relations are Platonic entities, we discover\nwhat they are by perceiving them through our powers of intuition. The\nsecond element is that the degrees may be non-numerical. So if the\nprobability of *p* given *h* is ${\\alpha}$, we may be able to say\n${\\alpha}$ \\> 0.3, and ${\\alpha}$ \\< 0.5, but not be able to give any\nfiner numerical limits. As a corollary, there are now two dimensions of\nconfirmatory support. Keynes claimed that as well as determining the\nprobability of *p* given *h*, we could determine the 'weight' of this\nprobability, where weight measures how much evidence we have. The more\nevidence is in *h*, the greater the weight. Keynes thought the\ndistinction between saying that on evidence *h*, *p* has a low\nprobability, and saying that the weight of that probability is low is\nimportant for understanding investment behaviour (*GT*: Ch.Â 12).\n\nBateman and Davis both claim that Keynes gave up this theory for an\nintersubjective theory in the *GT*. I'll focus on Bateman's book,\nlargely because the structure of his argument is more\nstraightforward[^4]. Bateman sets himself to offer another solution to\n'das Maynard Keynes problem', which he describes as follows.\n\n> \"[Future theorists] will read *Treatise on Probability*'s account of\n> the objective nature of probabilities and the way that rational people\n> employ them, and they will wonder at how this person could have turned\n> around 15 years later and written a book [the *GT*] in which\n> irrational people who base their decisions on social conventions cause\n> mass unemployment in the capitalist system\" (7)\n\nI doubt this is the right thing to say about the *GT*, but that's\nanother story. For now we might simply note that there's no obvious\nconflict here. For one thing, if the people in the *TP* are rational,\nand in the *GT* are irrational, as Bateman allows, it's not too\nsurprising they behave differently. More generally, it's to be expected\n(sadly) that normative and descriptive theories are different, and by\nBateman's lights that should explain the difference between the outlook\nof the explicitly normative *TP* and the at least partially descriptive\n*GT*. If the agents in the *GT* are irrational, that book cannot but be\na purely normative account of rationality. On the other hand, if the\n*TP* were taken to be descriptive and not just normative, if it claimed\nthat people really conform to its epistemological exhortations, there\ncould be a conflict. I can't imagine, however, what the evidence or\nmotivation for that reading could be.\n\nIf there were a conflict between the *GT* and *TP*, there ought be a\ngreater one between the 'rational people' of the *TP* and the blatantly\nirrational leaders in *Economic Consequences of the Peace* (*ECP*).\nThese books were published about 15 months apart, not 15 years. And the\nmost memorable parts of *ECP* are the descriptions of the mental\nfailings of President Wilson, who Lloyd George could 'bamboozle' into\nbelieving it was just to crush Germany completely, but not\n'de-bamboozle' out of this view when it became necessary. Or maybe we\nshould say there's a conflict because the characters in David Hume's\nhistories do not meet his ethical or epistemological norms.\n\nIf we give up Bateman's claim that the actors in the *GT* are\nirrational, and substitute the claim that the norms of rationality in\nthe two books differ, then we have a real conflict. And the most\ncharitable interpretation of Bateman is that this is the conflict he\nintends to discuss. At the bottom of page 12 he goes close to saying\nexactly this, but then proceeds to support his position with evidence\nthat Keynes changed his position on how rational people actually are.\nOnce we are claiming the change of view is with regard to norms,\nevidence of opinion changes about empirical questions becomes\nirrelevant. This does mean much of Bateman's case goes, though not yet\nall of it.\n\nThe main problem with Bateman's argument is that it rests on an\nequivocation over the use of the term 'Platonism'. In *TP* Keynes held\nthat probability relations are objective, non-natural and part of logic.\nI'll use 'logical' for the last property. When Bateman says Keynes\nbelieved probability relations were Platonic entities, he is alternately\nreferring to each of these properties. He seems to explicitly use\n'Platonic' to mean 'objective' on page 30, 'non-natural' on page 131,\nand 'logical' on page 123. But this isn't the important equivocation.\n\nSay a theory about some entities is a 'Strong Platonist' theory if it\nconcords with all Keynes's early beliefs: those entities are objective,\nnon-natural and logical. Bateman wants to conclude that by the time of\nthe *GT*, Keynes no longer had an objectivist theory of probability. But\nshowing he no longer held a Strong Platonist view won't get that\nconclusion, because there are 3 interesting objectivist positions which\nare not Strong Platonist. The following names are my own, but they\nshould be helpful.\n\nCarnapian\n\n:   Probability relations are objective, natural and logical. This is\n    what Carnap held in his [-@Carnap1950].\n\nGÃ¶delism\n\n:   Probability relations are objective, non-natural and non-logical.\n    GÃ¶del held this view about numbers, hence the name. I'd normally\n    call this position Platonism, but that name's under dispute. Indeed\n    I suspect this is what Keynes means by Platonism in *My Early\n    Beliefs*. [@KeynesMEB]\n\nReductionism\n\n:   Probability relations are objective, natural and non-logical. Such\n    positions don't have to reduce probability to something else, but\n    they usually will. Russell held such a position in his\n    [-@Russell1948].\n\nThese categories could apply to other entities, like numbers or moral\nproperties or colours, but we will be focussing on probability relations\nhere. Say a theory is 'Weak Platonist' if it is Strong Platonist or one\nof these three types. The most interesting equivocation in Bateman is\nusing 'Platonist' to refer to either Strong or Weak Platonist positions.\nHe argues that Keynes gave up his early Platonist position. These\narguments are sound if he means Strong Platonist, unsound if he means\nWeak Platonist. But if he means Strong Platonist he can't draw the extra\nconclusion that Keynes gave up objectivism about probability relations,\nwhich he does in fact draw. So I'll examine his arguments under the\nassumption that he means to show Keynes gave up Weak Platonism.\n\nWhatever Bateman means by Keynes's Platonism, he isn't very sympathetic\nto it. It gets described as 'obviously flawed' (4) and 'fatally flawed'\n(17), and is given as the reason for his work being ignored by 'early\npositivists and members of the Vienna Circle' (61). Given that the *TP*\nis cited extensively, and often approvingly, by Carnap in his 1950, this\nlast claim is clearly false. Most stunningly, he claims writers\ncommitted to the existence of Platonic entities cannot 'be considered to\nbe a part of the analytic tradition' (39), though he does concede in a\nfootnote that some 'early analytical philosophers' (he gives Frege as an\nexample) were Platonist. Bateman's paradigm of philosophy seems to be\nthe logical positivism of Ayer's *Language, Truth and Logic*: \"nowhere\nwould one less expect to find metaphysics than in modern analytical\nphilosophy\" [@Ayer1936 39].\n\nThere is an implicit argument in this derision. Keynes must, so the\nargument goes, have given up (Weak) Platonism because no sensible person\ncould believe it. If anything like this were sound it should apply to\nWeak Platonism about other entities. But the history of 'modern\nanalytical philosophy' shows that Weak Platonism (though not under that\nname) is quite widespread in metaphysical circles. Modern philosophy\nincludes believers in possible worlds both concrete and ersatz, in\nuniversals and in numbers. All these positions would fall under Weak\nPlatonism. Even Quine's ontologically sparse *Word and Object* was Weak\nPlatonist about classes, though he probably wouldn't like the label. So\nby analogy Weak Platonism about probability relations isn't so absurd as\nto assume Keynes must have seen its flaws.\n\nBateman's more important argument is direct quotation from Keynes. This\nargument is undermined largely because of Bateman's somewhat selective\nquotation. There are two sources where Keynes appears to recant some of\nhis early beliefs. Which early beliefs, and how early these beliefs\nwere, is up for debate. The two are his 1938 memoir *My Early Beliefs*\n(hereafter, *MEB*), and his 1931 review of Ramsey's posthumous\n*Foundations of Mathematics*. *MEB* wasn't published until 1949, three\nyears after Keynes's death, but according to its introduction it is\nunchanged from the version Keynes gave as a talk in 1938. In it he\nlargely discusses the influence of Moore, and particularly *Principia\nEthica*, on his beliefs before the first world war.\n\nThere are several connections between Moore's work and Keynes. The most\npertinent here is that Keynes's metaphysics of probability in *TP* is\nborrowed almost completely from Moore's metaphysics of goodness. Not\nonly are probability relations objective and non-natural, they are\nsimple and unanalysable. These are all attributes Moore assigns to\ngoodness. The only addition Keynes makes is that his probability\nrelations are logical. So Moore's position on goodness is, in our\nlanguage, GÃ¶delian.\n\nAs he says in *MEB*, Keynes became convinced of Moore's metaethics,\nthough he differed with Moore over the implications this had for ethics\nproper. In particular he disagreed with Moore's claim that individuals\nare morally bound to conform to social norms. Bateman seems to assume\nthat at any time Keynes's metaphysics of goodness and probability will\nbe roughly the same, and with the exception of questions about their\nlogical status, this seems a safe enough assumption.\n\nBateman quotes Keynes saying that his, and his friends', belief in\nMoore's metaethics was 'a religion, some sort of relation of\nneo-platonism' [@KeynesMEB 438]. This is part of the evidence that\nKeynes meant what I'm calling GÃ¶delism by 'Platonism'. Not only does he\nuse it to describe Moore's position, but comparing Platonism with\nreligion would be quite apt if he intends it to involve a commitment to\nobjective, non-natural entities. The important point to note is that he\nis using 'religion' to include his metaethics, a point Bateman also\nmakes, though it probably also includes some broad ethical\ngeneralisations. Bateman then describes the following paragraph as\nremoving 'any doubt that [Keynes] had thrown over his youthful\nPlatonism as untenable'. (40)\n\n> Thus we were brought up -- with Plato's absorption in the good in\n> itself, with a scholasticism which outdid St. Thomas, in calvinistic\n> withdrawal from the pleasures and successes of Vanity Fair, and\n> oppressed with all the sorrows of Werther. It did not pervert us from\n> laughing most of the time and we enjoyed supreme self-confidence,\n> superiority and contempt towards all the rest of the unconverted\n> world. But it was hardly a state of mind which a grown-up person in\n> his senses could sustain literally. [@Keynes1938 442].\n\nAs it stands, *perhaps* the last sentence signals a change in\nmetaphysical beliefs, as opposed to say a change in the importance of\npleasure-seeking. In any case the following paragraph (which Bateman\nneglects to quote) shows such an interpretation to be mistaken.\n\n> It seems to me looking back, that this religion of ours was a very\n> good one to grow up under. It remains nearer the truth than any other\n> I know, with less extraneous matter and nothing to be ashamed of \\...\n> It was a purer, sweeter air than Freud cum Marx. It is still my\n> religion under the surface. [@Keynes1938 442].\n\nSo was Keynes confessing to 'a state of mind which a grown-up person in\nhis senses couldn't sustain literally'? No; his 'religion' which he held\nonto was a very broad, abstract doctrine. It needed supplementation with\na even general ethical view, to wit an affirmative answer to one of\nMoore's 'open questions'. And then it needed some bridging principles to\nconvert those ethics into moral conduct in the world as we find it. His\nearly position included all these, and it seems it was in effect his\nearly 'bridging principles' he mocks in the above quote. These relied,\nthe memoir makes clear throughout, on an excessively optimistic view of\nhuman nature, so he thought in effect that he could prevent wrong by\nsimply proving to its perpetrators that they were wrong. Now giving up\none's bridging principles doesn't entail abandonment of a general\nethical view, let alone one's metaethics. Indeed, let alone one's\nmetaphysics of probability! And as the last quote makes clear, Keynes\nwas quite content with the most general, most abstract parts of his\nearly belief. If this were all Bateman had to go on it wouldn't even\nshow Keynes had abandoned Strong Platonism[^5].\n\nThere is more to Bateman's case. In Keynes's review[^6] of @RamseyFM, he\nrecanted on some of his theory of probability. This is quite important\nto the debate, so I'll quote the relevant section at some length.\n\n> Ramsey argues as against the view which I had put forward, that\n> probability is concerned not with objective relations between\n> propositions but (in some sense) with degrees of belief, and he\n> succeeds in showing that the calculus of probabilities simply amounts\n> to a set of rules for ensuring that the system of degrees of belief\n> which we hold shall be a *consistent* system. Thus the calculus of\n> probability belongs to formal logic. But the basis of our degrees of\n> belief -- or the *a priori* probabilities, as they used to be called\n> -- is part of our human outfit, perhaps given us merely by natural\n> selection, analogous to our perceptions and our memories rather than\n> to formal logic. So far I yield to Ramsey -- I think he is right. But\n> in attempting to distinguish 'rational' degrees of belief from belief\n> in general he was not yet, I think, quite successful. It is not\n> getting to the bottom of the principle of induction to merely say it\n> is a useful mental habit. [@Keynes1931 338-339].\n\nTellingly, Bateman neglects to quote the final two sentences. I think\nthere is an ambiguity here, turning on the scope of the 'so far' in the\nfourth sentence. If it covers the whole section quoted, it does amount\nto a wholesale recantation of Keynes's theory, and this is Bateman's\ninterpretation. But if we take the first sentence, or at least the first\nclause, as being outside its scope it does not. And there are two\nreasons for doing this. First, it seems inconsistent with Keynes's later\nreliance on the *TP* in parts of the *GT*, as [@ODonnell1989 Ch. 6] has\nstressed. Secondly, it is inconsistent with Keynes's complaint that on\nRamsey's view induction is merely a 'useful habit'. If Keynes had become\na full-scale subjectivist, he ought have realised that patterns of\nreasoning could only possibly be valid (if deductive) or useful\n(otherwise). Since he still thought there must be something more, he\nseems to believe an objectvist theory is correct, though by now he is\nprobably quite unsure as to its precise form. So in effect what Keynes\ndoes in this paragraph is summarise Ramsey's view, list the details he\nagrees with (that probability relations aren't logical), notes his\nagreement with them, and then lists the details he disagrees with (that\nprobability relations aren't objective).\n\nThere is more evidence that all this quote represents is a recantation\nof the view that probability relations are logical. Earlier in that\nreview he notes how little formal logic is now believed to achieve\ncompared with its promise at the start of the century.\n\n> The first impression conveyed by the work of Russell was that the\n> field of formal logic was enormously extended. The gradual perfection\n> of the formal treatment at the hands of himself, of Wittgenstein and\n> of Ramsey had been, however, gradually to empty it of content and to\n> reduce it more and more to mere dry bones, until finally it seemed to\n> exclude not only all experience, but most of the principles, usually\n> reckoned logical, of reasonable thought. [@Keynes1931 338].\n\nMore speculatively, I suggest Keynes's change of mind here (for this\nshows he had surely given up the view that probability relations are\nlogical) might be influenced by GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem. In the\n*TP* Keynes had followed Russell is saying mathematics is part of logic\n[@Keynes1921 293n]. That view was often held to be threatened by GÃ¶del's\nproof that there are mathematical truths which can't be proven, and that\nthe consistency of mathematics can't be proven. But no one suggested\nthis meant mathematics is merely subjective, or that mathematical\nPlatonism was therefore untenable. If this response to GÃ¶del is right,\nit shows there are objective standards of reasoning (i.e. mathematical\nstandards) that are not part of logic. This makes it less of a leap to\nsay there are objective principles of reasonable thought that are not\n'logical' in the narrow sense we've been using.\n\nSo would Keynes have known of GÃ¶del's theorem when he wrote this review?\nI think it's possible, though some more research is needed. Keynes's\nreview was published in *The New Statesman and Nation* on October 3,\n1931. This was a weekly political and literary magazine of which Keynes\nwas chairman. So we can safely conclude the piece was drafted not long\nbefore publication. GÃ¶del's theorem was first announced at a conference\nin Vienna in September 1930 [@Wang1987], and was published in early\n1931. While Keynes would certainly have not read GÃ¶del's paper, its\ncontent could easily have reached him through Cambridge in that 12 month\n'window'. Since the explicit aim of GÃ¶del's paper was to show the\nincompleteness of *Principia Mathematica*, it would have immediately had\nsome effect in Cambridge, both in philosophy and mathematics. Given this\nevidence, the probability Keynes knew of GÃ¶del's theorem when he wrote\nthe review of Ramsey still mightn't be greater than one-half, but it\nmightn't be less than that either.\n\nIn sum, I conclude that Keynes had given up his earlier belief that all\nrules of reasonable belief are logical. This is what he yields to\nRamsey. This concession would be supported by the 'drying up' of formal\nlogic that Keynes notes, perhaps most dramatically expressed in GÃ¶del's\ntheorem. But he hadn't given up the belief that there are objective\nrules which are extra-logical, and given the identification of\nprobability with degree of reasonable belief, he had no reason to reject\nGÃ¶delism or Reductionism about probability. Hence Bateman's argument\nthat he rejected objectivist theories of probability fails.\n\n### Conventionalism\n\nBateman and Davis each argue that Keynes adopted a conventionalist,\nintersubjectivist theory of probability. In Davis this is explicity\nattributed to Wittgenstein's influence, however in Bateman it is less\nclear what the source of this idea is. It isn't obvious what they mean\nby an intersubjective theory. In particular, it isn't clear whether they\nmean this to be an empirical or a normative theory; whether Keynes is\nclaiming that we ought set our degrees of belief by convention or that\nwe in general do. Since the empirical theory would be consistent with\nhis objectivist norms, and they stress the change in his views, I\nconclude they are claiming this is a new normative view. According to\nthis view being reasonable is analysed as conforming to conventions.\nThis is not a very standard epistemological position, but something\nsimilar is often endorsed in ethics. Bateman marshals the evidence that\nKeynes moves from an objectivist to a conventionalist position in ethics\nas evidence for this epistemological shift, but this doesn't seem of\noverwhelming significance[^7].\n\nHere's the closest Bateman gets to a definition of what he means by an\nintersubjective theory of probability.\n\n> When probabilities are formed according to group norms, they are\n> referred to as intersubjective probabilities \\... I take it to be the\n> case that in a world of subjective probabilities some individuals will\n> form their own estimates and others will form them on the basis of\n> group norms (50n).\n\nThis makes it look very much like an empirical theory, as it refers to\nhow people actually form beliefs, not how they ought. So his\nintersubjectivism looks perfectly consistent with Keynes's objectivism.\nI am completely baffled by the 'world of subjective probabilities'. I\nwonder what such a world looks like, and how it compares to our world of\ntables, chairs and stock markets?\n\nFortunately there is a theory that does the work Bateman needs.\n@Ayer1936 rejects orthodox subjectivism about probability on the grounds\nthat it doesn't allow people to have mistaken probabilistic beliefs. But\nhe can't admit Keynesian probability relations into his sparse ontology.\nThe solution he adopts is to define probability as degree of rational\nbelief, but with this caveat.\n\n> Here we may repeat that the rationality of a belief is defined, not by\n> reference to any absolute standard, but by reference to part of our\n> own actual practice [@Ayer1936 101].\n\nThe 'our' is a bit ambiguous; interpreting it to refer to the community\ndoesn't do violence to the text, though it is just as plausible that it\nrefers to a particular agent. The 'part of our practice' referred to is\njust our general rules for belief formation. These aren't justified by\nan absolute standard; they are justified by the fact they are our rules,\nand presumably by their generality. Given Bateman's views about\nmetaphysics, it seems quite reasonable to suppose he'd follow Ayer on\nthis point.\n\nThe evidence Keynes adopted such a position is usually taken to be some\npassages from the *GT* and the 1937 *QJE* paper in which he replied to\nsome attacks on that book. Here's the key points from the two quotes\nBateman uses to support his view.\n\n> In practice we have agreed to fall back on what is, in truth, a\n> *convention*. The essence of this convention -- though it does not, of\n> course, work out quite so simply -- lies in assuming that the existing\n> state of affairs will continue indefinitely, except in so far as we\n> have specific reasons for expecting a change (*GT*: 152).\n\n> How do we manage in such circumstances to behave in a manner which\n> saves out faces as rational, economic men? We have devised for the\n> purposes a variety of techniques, of which much the most important are\n> the three following: \\...\n>\n> \\(3\\) Knowing that our own individual judgement is worthless, we\n> endeavour to fall back on the judgement of the rest of the world which\n> is perhaps better informed. That is, we endeavour to conform with the\n> behaviour of the majority or the average. The psychology of a society\n> of individuals each of whom is endeavouring to copy the others leads\n> to what we may strictly term a *conventional* judgement [@Keynes1937\n> 115].\n\nThere are two problems with using this evidence the way Bateman does.\nThe first is the old one that they seem expressly directed to empirical\nquestions, though perhaps appearances are deceptive here. The more\nimportant one is that Keynes is attempting to answer a very specific\nquestion with these passages; in ignorance of the question we can easily\nmisinterpret the answer.\n\nHow much ought one pay for a share in company X? Well, if one intends to\nhold the share come what may, all that matters is the expected\nprospective yield of X's shares, appropriately discounted, as compared\nto the potential yield of that money in other uses. But as Keynes\nrepeatedly stresses (*GT*: 149; [@Keynes1937 114]) we have no basis for\nforming such expectations. Were this the only reason for investing then\npurely commercial investment may never happen.\n\nThere is another motivation for investment, one that avoids this\nproblem. We might buy a share in X today on the hope that we will sell\nit next week (or next month or perhaps next year) for more than we paid.\nTo judge whether such a purchase will be profitable, we need a theory\nabout how the price next week will be determined. Presumably those\nbuyers and sellers will be making much the same evaluations that we are.\nThat is, they'll be thinking about how much other people think X is\nworth.\n\n> We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to\n> anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.\n> And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and\n> higher degrees (*GT*: 156).\n\nThere is simply no solution to this except to fall back on convention.\nThat is, we are forced into a conventionalist theory of value, at least\nof investment goods. But this doesn't mean that we have a\nconventionalist epistemology. On the contrary, it means that our\nordinary (objectivist) empiricism is unimpeded. For the question that\nKeynes has us solve by reference to convention is: What is the value of\nX? This is equivalent to, what will be value of X be, or again, to what\nare the conventional beliefs about X's value? We need to answer a\nquestion about the state of conventions, and as good empiricists we\nanswer it by observing conventions.\n\nAn analogy may help here. Here's something that Hempel believed: to gain\nrational beliefs about the colour of ravens, one has to look at some\nbirds. Did this mean he had an ornithological epistemology? No; he had\nan empiricist epistemology which when applied to a question about ravens\nissued the directive: Observe ravens! Similarly Keynes's belief that to\nanswer questions about value, i.e. about conventions, one has to look at\nconventions, does not imply a conventionalist epistemology. It just\nmeans he has an empiricist epistemology which when applied to a question\nabout conventions issues the directive: Observe conventions!\n\nThere might be another motivation for using conventions, again\nconsistent with Keynes's objectivist empiricism. Sometimes we may have\nnot made enough observations, or may not have the mental power to\nconvert these to a theory. So we'll piggyback on someone else's\nobservations or mental powers. (This seems to be what's going on in the\nquote from @Keynes1937.) Or even better, we'll piggyback on everyone's\nwork, the conventions. To see how this is consistent with an objectivist\nepistemology (if it isn't already obvious) consider another analogy.\n\nWhat is the best way to work out the derivative of a certain function?\nUnless your memory of high-school calculus is clear, the simplest\nsolution will be to consult an authority. Let's assume for the sake of\nargument that the easiest authorities to consult are maths texts. It\nseems like the rational thing to do is to act as if the method advanced\nby the maths texts is the correct method. Does this mean that you have\nadopted some kind of authoritarian metaphysics of mathematics, where\nwhat it is for something to be correct is for it to be asserted by an\nauthority? Not at all. It is assumed that what the textbook says is\ncorrect, but the authoritarian has to make the extra claim that the\nanswer is correct *because* it is in the textbook. This is false; that\nanswer is in the textbook because it is correct. In sum, the\nauthoritarian gets the direction of fit wrong.\n\nSimilarly in the 'piggyback' cases the intersubjectivist gets the\ndirection of fit wrong. We are accepting that *p* has emerged as\n'average opinion', then it is reasonable to believe *p*. But we aren't\nsaying with the intersubjectivist it is reasonable to believe *p*\nbecause *p* is average opinion; rather we are assuming *p* is average\nopinion because it is reasonable to believe *p*.\n\nThe evidence so far suggests Keynes's statements are consistent with his\ndenying intersubjectivism. We might be able to go further and show they\nare inconsistent with his adopting that theory. After the quote on *GT*\npage 152 he spends the next page or so defending the use of conventions\nhere. The defence is, in part, that decisions made in accord with\nconventions are reversible in the near future, so they won't lead to\ngreat loss. If he really were an intersubjectivist, the use of\nconventions would either not need defending, or could be defended by\ngeneral philosophical principles. Secondly, there is this quote which in\ncontext seems inconsistent with adopting a conventionalist view.\n\n> For it is not sensible to pay 25 for an investment which you believe\n> the prospective yield to justify a value of 30, if you also believe\n> that the market will value it at 20 three months hence (*GT*: 155).\n\nThe context is that he is discussing why reasonable professional\ninvestors base their valuations on convention rather than on long-term\nexpectation. Hence the 'you' in the quote is assumed to be reasonable.\nHence it is reasonable, Keynes thinks, to believe that an investment's\nprospective yield justifies a value of 30, and that conventional wisdom\nis that its prospective yield is much lower. But if all reasonable\nbeliefs were formed by accordance with conventional wisdom, this would\nbe inconsistent. Hence Keynes cannot have adopted a conventionalist\nepistemology.\n\n### Keynes and Vagueness\n\nWhat a terrible state Keynes interpretation has got into! From the same\nfew pages (the opening of *GT* Ch.Â 4) @Coates1996 reads into Keynes a\npreference for basing theory on vague predicates, @BradfordHarcourt1997\nread Keynes as denying that predicates which are unavoidably vague can\nbe used in theory, and @ODonnell1997 sees Keynes as holding a position\nin between these.\n\nCoates's theory is that Keynes abandoned the narrowly analytic\nfoundations of his early philosophy because of the problems of vagueness\nthat were pointed out to him by Wittgenstein. He has Keynes in 1936\nadopting a middle way between analytic and Continental philosophy, which\ngives up on analysis because of unavoidable vagueness, but which doesn't\nfollow Derrida in saying all that's left after analysis is 'poetry'. He\nalso wants to argue for the philosophical importance of this theory. In\nthis essay I'll focus on his exegetical theories, though there are\nconcerns to be raised about his philosophy.\n\nAs in Bateman, analytic philosophy gets very narrowly defined in\nCoates[^8]. Here it includes the claim that truth-value gaps are not\nallowed (xii). This excludes from the canon some of the most important\npapers in analytical philosophy of the last few decades (e.g.\n@Dummett1959, @vanFraassen1966, @Fine1975a, @Kripke1975), and hence must\nbe a mistake. To use one of Coates's favourite terms, 'analytic\nphilosophy' is a family resemblance concept, not to be so narrowly cast.\nIn particular, as we'll see, analytic philosophers don't have to follow\nFrege in being nihilist about vagueness.\n\nEven more bizarrely, Coates defines empiricism so it includes both\npsychologism in logic and utilitarianism in ethics (72-3). Since\n@Ayer1936 opposes each of these doctrines, does that makes Ayer an\nanti-empiricist? If Ayer is a paradigm empiricist (as seems plausible)\nKeynes's rejection of psychologism and utilitarianism can hardly count\nas proof of opposition to empiricism, as Coates wants it to do. Apart\nfrom the fact that Mill believed all three, there is no interesting\nconnection between empiricism, psychologism and utilitarianism.\n\nCoates's story is that in the *GT* Keynes allowed both his units and his\ndefinitions to be quantitatively vague so as to follow natural language.\nThis constitutes a new 'philosophy of social science' (85) that is based\non the ordinary language philosophy of the later Wittgenstein. There are\nseveral problems with this story. The first is that most of Coates's\nevidence comes from *obiter dicta* in early drafts of the *GT*; by the\ntime the book was finished most of these suggestions are expunged. The\nsecond is that it's quite possible to accept vagueness within a highly\nanalytic philosophical framework. The third is that the way Keynes uses\nvagueness is only consistent within such a framework.\n\nThe first part of the story focuses on how Keynes derided his\npredecessors for using concepts that were vague as if they were precise.\nCoates adduces evidence to show Keynes in this context used 'vague' as a\nsynonym for 'quantitatively inexact'. The most important concept misused\nby Keynes's predecessors in this way was the general price level. Of\ncourse this was hardly a new point in the *GT*; @Keynes1909 says similar\nthings. Coates claims that Keynes's reaction to this misuse was to\n'criticise formal methods' (83), and to conclude that 'economic analysis\ncan do without the \"mock precision\" of formal methods' (85). This is all\nhard to square with Keynes's explicit comments.\n\n> The well-known, but unavoidable, element of vagueness which admittedly\n> attends the concept of the general price-level makes this term very\n> unsatisfactory for the purposes of a causal analysis, which ought to\n> be exact (*GT*:Â 39).\n\nFurther, Keynes then defends his choice of units of quantity (quantity\nof money-value and quantities of employment) on the grounds that they\nare not quantitatively vague. Coates is surely right when he says that\nKeynes's analysis of vagueness here is 'not very controversial';\nalthough it is perhaps misleading to say it is controversial at all.\n\nThe second, and central, part of the story focuses on how Keynes allowed\nhis definitions to be vague, but defended this on the grounds of\nconformity to ordinary language. This 'introduces what is distinctive\nabout his later philosophy of the social sciences' (85). The bulk of\nCoates's evidence comes from Keynes's commentary on his own definitions;\nusually this includes a claim that he has captured the ordinary usage of\nthe term. Since he uses 'common usage' to explicitly mean 'usage amongst\neconomists' (*GT*: 79) the support these *dicta* give to Coates's theory\nmight be minimal, but we'll ignore that complication. The real problem\nis that this commentary extends to cases where he has changed his mind\nover the best definition. For example, Coates quotes Keynes writing in a\ndraft of the *GT* about the definition of income.\n\n> But finally I have come to the conclusion that the use of language,\n> which is most convenient on a balance of considerations and involves\n> the least departure from current usage, is to call the actual sale\n> proceeds *income* and the present value of the expected sale proceeds\n> *effective demand* [@Keynes1934 425].\n\nCoates comments:\n\n> By choosing definitions on the ground that they correspond with actual\n> usage Keynes was formulating an ordinary language social science, one\n> that bears a resemblance to those argued for by philosophers of\n> hermeneutics (90).\n\nHe then goes on to note some comments from the *GT* apparently about\nthis definition, and how it relates to common usage. The problem is that\nthis isn't the definition of income Keynes settles on in the *GT*. There\nhe defines income of an agent as \"the excess of the value of his\nfinished output sold during the period over the prime cost\" (*GT*:Â 54),\nand *net income* (which Coates fails to distinguish) as income less\nsupplementary cost. Given that at every stage Keynes justified his\ncurrent definitions by their (alleged) conformity with common usage,\neven when he changed definitions, it is hard to believe that these\njustifications are more than rhetorical flourishes. After all, who will\ndeny that *ceteris paribus* technical definitions should follow ordinary\nusage?\n\nIf Keynes's early choice of definitions showed an adherence to a\n'philosophy of hermeneutics', perhaps his abandonment of those\ndefinitions constitutes abandonment of that philosophy. One change\ndoesn't necessarily mean a change in foundations, so it is worth looking\nat those foundations.\n\nAs I mentioned, allowing that vagueness exists doesn't mean abandoning\nthe Russellian program of giving a precise analysis of language. There\nare two reasons for this. First, contra Wittgenstein it is possible to\nanalyse vague terms. Secondly, there are semantic programs very much in\nthe spirit of Russell which allow vagueness. I'll deal with these in\norder.\n\nIn *Philosophical Investigations*, @Wittgenstein1953 argued that the\nexistence of vagueness frustrated the program of analysis (ss.Â 60, 71).\nThe argument presumably is that analyses are precise, and hence they\ncannot accurately capture vague terms. (See also his comments about the\nimpossibility of drawing the boundaries of 'game' in s. 68.) This is a\nsimple philosophical mistake. We can easily give an analysis of a vague\nterm, we just have to make the analysans vague in exactly the same way\nas the analysandum.\n\nTo see this in action, consider that paradigm of modern philosophy,\nLewis's analysis of subjunctive conditionals or counterfactuals.\n@Lewis1973a says that the conditional 'If *p* were the case, it would be\nthat *q*' is true iff *q* is true in the most similar possible world in\nwhich *p*. He considers the objection that 'most similar' is completely\nvague and imprecise.\n\n> Imprecise it may be; but that is all to the good. Counterfactuals are\n> imprecise too. Two imprecise concepts may be rigidly fastened to one\n> another, swaying together rather than separately, and we can hope to\n> be precise about their connection @Lewis1973a.\n\nWhatever the fate of Lewis's theory, his methodology seems\nuncontestable. Wittgenstein's claim that analysis must be abandoned\nbecause of vagueness is refuted by these observations of Lewis. Hence\nCoates's claim that allowing vagueness (as Keynes does) means giving up\non analytic philosophy is mistaken.\n\nThe second problem with Coates's comments on vagueness is that he hasn't\nallowed for what I'll call 'orthodox' responses to vagueness. The aim of\nthe early analytics drifted between giving a precise model for natural\nlanguage, and replacing natural language with an artificial precise\nlanguage. The latter, claims Coates, ought be abandoned because of the\npragmatic virtues of a vague language. Let's agree to that; can the\nspirit of the early aim of giving a precise analysis of language be\npreserved?\n\nTwo approaches which seem to meet this requirement are the\nsupervaluational and epistemic theories of vagueness. The\nsupervaluationist says language can't be represented by a precise\nclassical model, but it can be represented by a set of such models. The\nepistemic theorist says that there is a precise model of language, but\nwe cannot know what it is[^9]. Call a theorist who adopts one of these\napproaches 'orthodox'. The name is chosen because supporters and critics\nof orthodoxy agree that these positions represent attempts to minimise\ndeviations from the classical, Russellian program.\n\nClearly Keynes did not explicitly adopt an orthodox theory of vagueness.\n@Williamson1994-WILV attempts to trace the epistemic theory back to the\nStoics, but general consensus is that these approaches were all but\nunknown until recently. What I want to argue is that Keynes's intuitions\nare clearly with orthodoxy. Coates, on the other hand, wants to place\nKeynes in a tradition that is critical of classical analysis, and\nperhaps finds its best modern expression in the exponents of fuzzy\nlogics. To see this is wrong, note that the following beliefs are all in\nthe *GT*.\n\n1.  All goods are (definitely) investment goods or consumption goods.\n\n2.  For some goods it is vague whether they are an investment or\n    consumption good. (*GT*: 61)\n\n3.  The yield of an investment, *q*, is vague.\n\n4.  The carrying cost of an investment, *c*, is vague.\n\n5.  The net yield of an investment, *q*Â -Â *c*, can be precisely\n    determined. (*GT*: 226)\n\nSince Keynes believed (1) to (5) we can safely conclude he believed they\nwere consistent. More importantly, since the *GT* has been analysed more\nthoroughly than any other economic text written this century, and no one\nhas criticised the consistency of (1) to (5), it seems many people agree\nwith him. Hence if conformity with pre-theoretic intuitions of\nconsistency is a central desideratum of a theory of vagueness, we can\ndiscard any theory that does not say they are consistent. However, of\nthose theories on the market, only orthodox theories meet this\nrequirement. It might also be noted that (1) and (2) are repeated in\njust about every introductory macro textbook, again without to my\nknowledge any question of their consistency.\n\nWe can quickly see that these propositions are all consistent on either\northodox theory. The supervaluationist says there is a set of classical\nmodels for a language; a sentence is true iff it is true on all models,\nfalse iff it is false on all models, and truth-valueless otherwise.\nVague terms have different meanings on different models. So for a\nparticular good, say a car, about which it is vague whether it is an\ninvestment or consumption good, the supervaluationist says it is an\ninvestment good on some models and a consumption good on others. So (2)\nis satisfied; however on all models it, like everything else, is either\na consumption or investment good, so (1) is satisfied. Similarly because\nit is vague whether some costs should be counted as deductions from the\nyield of an investment or increments to its carrying cost, the values of\n*q* and *c* will be different on different models. Hence (3) and (4) are\ntrue, but *q* -Â *c* is constant across models[^10], so (5) is true.\n\nThe epistemic theorist says that vagueness is just ignorance. As we can\nknow that a car is an investment or consumption good without knowing\nwhich, (1) and (2) can be satisfied. Similarly, since we can know that a\ncost is incurred without knowing how to account for it in Keynes's\nterms, we can know *q*Â -Â *c* precisely without knowing *q* or *c*\nprecisely, and hence (3) to (5) can be satisfied.\n\nThe heterodox theorist has a harder time. The theorist who, following\n@Russell1923, says that vagueness is infectious, if a part is vague so\nis the whole, will deny that (1) and (2) can be true together. Unless\nit's definitely true that a car is an investment or definitely true it's\na consumption good it can't be definitely true that it's one or the\nother. This also seems to be the position taken by @Wittgenstein1953.\n\nThe nihilist about vagueness, who follows Frege in saying vague terms\ncan't be used coherently, similarly can't endorse both (1) and (2). On\nthat view, if *p* and *q* are both vague, then their disjunction can't\nbe true. Arguably, on this position the disjunction of *p* with anything\ncant be true, as it is nonsense, but we don't need anything that\nstrong.[^11]\n\nThe extra truth-values approach to vagueness (of which fuzzy logic is a\nvariant) also can't make (1) and (2) consistent. On any such approach\n(whether 3-valued, *n*-valued or continuum-valued) the degree of truth\nof a disjunction can't be higher than the degree of truth of each of the\ndisjuncts. So if neither 'This is an investment' nor 'This is a\nconsumption good' is absolutely true (true to degree 1), 'This is an\ninvestment or consumption good' can't be absolutely true. Yet this is\njust what Keynes asserted to be possible, and what several generations\nof readers have found perfectly consistent. I have only remarked about\nthe problem the consistency of (1) and (2) poses for heterodox theories.\nThese remarks apply, *mutatis mutandis*, to (3), (4) and (5), but as\ntheorists rarely discuss quantitative vagueness (as opposed to\ntruth-value vagueness) these cases involve a bit more speculation as to\nwhat heterodoxy says.\n\nHence Keynes did not belong to a heterodox tradition *vis a vis*\nvagueness, and heterodox theories fail to capture a crucial\npre-theoretic intuition about vague terms. So Coates's claims that\nKeynes followed Wittgenstein into heterodoxy here, and that he ought\nhave, are both mistaken.\n\nEven if all of the above is mistaken, there remains serious doubt that\nKeynes had in mind anything like what Coates attributes to him. Coates\nmakes the chapters on definitions in the *GT* into the foundations of a\nnew philosophy, and constituting an important revolution in theory. This\nis crucial to Coates's story about the influence of Wittgenstein on\nKeynes. But this attribution is totally at odds with Keynes's comments\non these chapters, comments that not only reveal his attitudes towards\nhis definitions but also seem a fair commentary on them.\n\n> I have felt that these chapters were a great drag on getting on to the\n> real business, and would perplex the reader quite unnecessarily with a\n> lot of points which really do not matter to my proper theme (Keynes to\n> Roy Harrod, 9 August 1935, quoted in [@KeynesCW XIII: 537]).\n>\n> But the main point I would urge is that all this is *not* fundamental.\n> *Being clear* is fundamental, but the choice of definitions of income\n> and investment is not (Keynes to Dennis Robertson, 29 January 1935,\n> quoted in [@KeynesCW XIII, 495, italics in original]).\n\n### Keynes on Rules and Private Language\n\nHad Keynes followed Wittgenstein in the ways suggested by either Bateman\nor Coates he would have been led into error. Fortunately he was not\ntempted. There was, however, one point on which Keynes clearly did not\nfollow Wittgenstein, and sadly so for Wittgenstein was right. If\n@Kripke1982 is correct and this is the crucial point in the later\nWittgenstein's thinking, Keynes's failure to observe it provides strong\nevidence that Wittgenstein's influence on him was at best slight.\n\nKeynes, as we saw above, thought we dealt with uncertainty by assuming\nthat the future would resemble the present. Call this Keynes's maxim.\nBut this, points out Wittgenstein, gets us nowhere. We know that the\nfuture will resemble the present; what we don't know is how it will do\nso. Wittgenstein illustrates this with examples from mathematics and\nsemantics, but we can apply it more broadly.\n\nSay that a particle in a one-dimensional Euclidean space is now at\nposition *d*, travelling at velocity *v* under acceleration *a*.\nAssuming things stay the same, where will the particle be in 1 unit of\ntime? This question simply can't be answered, until we know what in what\nrespect things will 'stay the same'. If it is in respect of position,\nthe answer is *d*, in respect of velocity it is *d*Â +Â *v*, in respect of\nacceleration *d*Â +Â *v*Â +Â *a*/2. Perhaps our Newtonian intuitions make us\nprefer the second answer, perhaps not.\n\nThe same story applies in economics. When we assume things will stay the\nsame, does that mean we are assuming the unemployment rate or the rate\nof change of the unemployment rate to be the same; real growth or\nnominal growth to be constant? At the level of the firm, we can ask\nwhether Keynes's maxim would have us assume real or nominal profits to\nbe constant, or perhaps the growth rate of real or nominal profits, or\nperhaps sales figures (real or nominal, absolute or variation), or\nperhaps one of the variables which play a role like acceleration (rate\nof change of sales growth)? In some computing firms we might even take\nsome of the logarithmic variables (growth of logarithm of sales) to be\nthe constant. We can't in consistency assume more than one or two of\nthese variables to be unchanged, yet Keynes provides us with nothing to\ntell between them.\n\nMore importantly, it looks like Keynes hasn't even seen the problem. The\nmechanical example above looks very similar to some of the paradoxes of\nindifference (*TP*: Ch. 4). For example, in von Kries's cube factory\nexample, we know that a factory makes cubes with side length between 0\nand 2cm. If that's all we know, what should we say is the probability\nthat the next cube's side length will be greater than 1cm? According to\nLaplace's principle of indifference we should divide the probabilities\nequally between the possibilities, which seems to give an answer of 1/2.\nHowever we could have set out the problem by saying that the volume of\ncubes produced is between 0 and 8cm^3^ and we want to know the\nprobability the volume of the next cube is greater than 1cm^3^. Now the\nanswer (to the same problem) looks to be 7/8. And if we set out the\nproblem in terms of surface area we seem to get the answer 3/4. The\nconclusion is that the principle of indifference could only be saved if\nwe have a small designated set of predicates to which we can exclusively\napply it. But now it seems Keynes's maxim can only work if we have a\nsmall designated set of predicates to which we can exclusively apply it,\nand if we do that we can avoid the paradoxes of indifference. Keynes\nexplicitly adopts his maxim to avoid the paradoxes of indifference\n(*GT*: 152). He would hardly have done this if he knew structurally\nsimilar problems beset the maxim as best the principle of indifference.\nAs further evidence he just missed this point, note that while he was\nnot averse to wielding philosophical tools in economic writing (like the\nparadoxes of indifference), Wittgenstein's point is not mentioned; not\nin the *GT*, not in any of its drafts and not in any of the\ncorrespondence after it was published.\n\nFor Kripke, this point is central to Wittgenstein's private language\nargument. All that we can know about the meaning of a word is how our\ncommunity has used it in the past. We must assume they'll use it the\nsame way in the future. But what is to count as using it the same way?\n*A* *priori* it looks like any usage of a word could count; the only\nthing that could make usage of a word wrong is the user has a different\nway of using the word 'the same way' to everyone else. Hence if there is\nno community to set such standards there are no bars on how words can be\nused. And if there are no such bars, there is nothing that can properly\nbe called a language. Hence there can't be a private language.\n\nGiven the importance of that conclusion to Wittgenstein's later\nphilosophy, if Kripke is even close to right in his reconstruction then\nit is central to the later Wittgenstein that Keynes's maxim is\ncontentless. As Keynes clearly didn't think this (witness the central\nrole it plays in summaries of the *GT* like Keynes 1937) he hasn't\nadopted a central tenet of the later Wittgenstein's work. This puts a\nrather heavy burden on those who would say he became a Wittgensteinian.\nThe arguments presented so far do nothing to lift that burden.\n\n[^1]: Davis's views are also set out in his [-@Davis1995], and Coates's\n    to some extent in his [-@Coates1997], but I will focus on the more\n    detailed position in their respective books.\n\n[^2]: In the way that, for example, subjective Bayesianism was arguably\n    invented by and eventually rejected by Ramsey.
