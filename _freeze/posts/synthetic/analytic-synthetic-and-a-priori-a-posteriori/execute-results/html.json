Four important stops in the history are considered: two involving Kant and W. V. O. Quine, and two relating to logical positivism and semantic externalism. The article then examines questions that have been raised about the analytic–synthetic and a priori–a posteriori distinctions, such as whether all distinctively philosophical truths fall on one side of the line and whether the distinction is relevant to philosophy. It also discusses the argument that there is a lot more a priori knowledge than we ever thought, and concludes by describing epistemological accounts of analyticity.\ndate: May 1 2016\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.24\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - language\n  - history of analytic\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1080/0020174X.2013.775015\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: vixen.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 4\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n### History\n\nIt's easy to give a rough gloss of the notions of analyticity and a\npriority.\n\n-   Something is an analytic truth iff it is true in virtue of its\n    meaning.\n\n-   Something is an a priori truth iff it is knowably true without\n    justification by experience.\n\nAnd this yields us two distinctions, between analytic truths and\nsynthetic truths (i.e., every truth that isn't analytic), and between a\npriori truths and a posteriori truths (i.e., every truth that isn't a\npriori). But fleshing out these distinctions takes some work, as we'll\nsee. Let's start by a quick historical survey of work on the two\ndistinctions, their relationship to each other, and their relationship\nto the necessary/contingent distinction. There are four important stops\nin the history.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Oxford Handbook of Philosophical Methodlology_, edited  by Herman Cappelen, Tamar Szabó Gendler, and John Hawthorne, 231-248.\n\nPicture via [Tambako the Jaguar](https://www.flickr.com/photos/8070463@N03) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/98bdd95a-b680-45b3-9a98-796e0990d714).\n</aside>\n\nThe distinction between \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" traces back to Kant.\nHe thought that both distinctions in our title (analytic/synthetic and a\npriori/a posteriori) were real, and that they were not the same\ndistinction. In particular, he held that most interesting philosophical\nand mathematical claims were synthetic a priori. This is because he (at\nleast most of the time) worked with a fairly narrow notion of\nanalyticity. A subject-predicate sentence *A is B* is analytic if \"the\npredicate *B* belongs to the subject *A* as something that is (covertly)\ncontained in this concept *A*\"  [@KantFirstCritique 6]. But there can be\nplenty of a priori truths that do not fall under this narrow category.\n\nLet's look at one example of current importance. Consider the claim\n*Whatever is known is true*. It is at least plausible that that is a\npriori; that we don't need to look into the world to know that knowledge\nimplies truth. But is it analytic for Kant? It is iff there is an\nanalysis of knowledge, and the analysis is of the form *S knows that p\niff p is true, and X*, for some value of *X*. Most epistemologists\nnowadays would reject the idea that there is an analysis of knowledge.\nBut even among those who hold out hope for such an analysis, an argument\nby Linda @Zagzebski1994 has convinced most people that the analysis\ncannot be of this form. In particular, Zagzebski argued that if there is\nsuch an analysis, *X* must entail that *p* is true, eliminating the need\nfor this clause. So *Whatever is known is true* will turn out, by\nKantian standards, to be synthetic, even if it is a priori.\n\nAlthough Kant did not think the two distinctions we are focussing on are\nequivalent, most scholars take him to have thought all and only\nnecessary truths are a priori knowable. (Though see @Strang2011 for a\ndissent.) This will be a common theme throughout much of the history.\n\nOur second stop on the history is logical positivism, most clearly\nrepresented in English by @Ayer1936. The positivists thought that all\nthree distinctions were in a fairly deep sense equivalent. In\nparticular, they thought all three were very close to the distinction\nbetween theorems and non-theorems of logic. The positivists were,\nself-consciously, building on the tradition of British empiricism. But\nunlike some empiricists, they didn't want to insist on an empirical\nbasis for logical and mathematical knowledge.[^1] The solution was to\nbuild on the logicism about mathematics developed by Frege and Russell.\n\nBorrowing a term from @Boghossian1996-BOGAR, let's say that a sentence\nis *Frege-analytic* iff it can be converted to a logical truth by the\nsubstitutions of synonyms. The positivists thought that all a priori,\nnecessary and analytic truths were the Frege-analytic truths. Without\nlogicism, this would be wildly implausible, since mathematical truths\nwould be an exception. But Frege and Russell had done enough to make\nthat possibility less worrying.\n\nThe positivists' view has some epistemological attractiveness. How can\nwe know things without having empirical input? And how can we know that\nsome things are true not just in this world, but in all worlds? Well,\nsay the positivists, by knowing the language (which we learn\nempirically) we learn what sentences are related by the substitution of\nsynonyms. And then the puzzles about knowledge of analytic or necessary\ntruths just reduce to puzzles about the epistemology of logic.\n\nOur third major stop then is with Quine, who questioned both steps of\nthis attempted explanation. First, @QuineTruthConvention noted that the\nstory still needs an epistemology of logic. The obvious expansion of the\nstory told so far won't work. It can't just be by learning the meanings\nof the logical connectives that we come to learn which the logical\ntruths are. That's because we need to be able to derive the consequences\nof those meanings, and for that we need logic.\n\nBut second, @QuineTwoDogmas argued that we have no independent way to\nmake sense of the notion of synonymy that is at the heart of\nFrege-analyticity. This is the most famous part of Quine's attack on the\nempiricists epistemology of logic and mathematics, but it isn't the\nstrongest part of it. Indeed, the argument in \"Two Dogmas\" is both\nstrange and self-undermining.[^2] Quine's primary complaint in that\npaper about the notions of analyticity, synonymy and meaning is that the\nonly way we have of understanding these notions is in terms of the\nothers. But that would only be a problem if we thought we needed to\nunderstand them in terms of something else. Arguably we need not; the\nnotions could be theoretical primitives. And especially if one is a\nconfirmation holist (and part of the point of \"Two Dogmas\" is to defend\nholism) we shouldn't worry about circularity cropping up near the core\nof our epistemology. Relatedly, a naturalist like Quine shouldn't care\nabout whether we can give a definition of terms like 'meaning', but\nrather about whether it is a useful concept in a science like\nlinguistics or cognitive science.\n\nTo avoid attributing an incoherent position to Quine, we should\ninterpret Quine the argument of \"Two Dogmas\" as part of his larger\nargument against the appeal to meanings and analyticities.[^3] Quine's\nlarger point, as defended in  [@Quine1960], was that meanings were\nunnecessary scientific postulates. He thinks that we simply don't need\nthem to explain all the facts about cognition and communication that\nneed explaining. Now it isn't clear how many people will share Quine's\nview that meanings are unnecessary for these sciences, since without his\nbehaviourism the attempt to do without meanings looks unsuccessful. But\nthe larger point is that Quine isn't simply relying on an argument from\nthe irreducibility of analyticity to a dismissal of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction.\n\nThe last stop on our history tour is semantic externalism. The\nexternalists complicated the above story in two overlapping ways. First,\nthey developed convincing arguments that necessity and a priority were\ndissociable. The most compelling of these arguments were the examples of\nnecessary a posteriori truths, such as *Water contains oxygen*. No\nmatter what surface characteristics or functional roles a substance\nmight play, if it does not contain oxygen, it could not be water.\n\nSecond, they showed that the pre-theoretical notion of meaning, which\nhad seemed good enough for much prior philosophical theorising,\ncontained a number of distinct ideas. Here is how Gillian Russell (whose\nwritings I've leaned heavily on in this introduction) puts it,\n\n> In three astonishingly influential pieces of philosophical writing,\n> @Putnam1973 argued that meaning couldn't be both what a speaker\n> grasped and what determined extension, @Kaplan1989 argued that what\n> determines extension (character) and what got contributed to what a\n> sentence said (content) came apart in the cases of indexicals and\n> demonstratives, and @Kripke1980 argued that what determined the\n> extension of a name or natural kind term need not be known in order\n> for a speaker to understand the expression, nor was it what was\n> contributed to the proposition expressed by a sentence containing one.\n> Each was suggesting that the roles attributed to a single thing-the\n> expression's meaning-in the [pre-theoretical] picture, can be played\n> by distinct things. [@Russell2008 x]\n\nFrom this point on, when we talk about truth in virtue of meaning, we\nhave to clarify which aspect of 'meaning' we mean. With that in mind,\nlet's turn to the questions that have been raised about the\ndistinctions.\n\n### Five Questions {#fivequestions}\n\nTo focus our discussion, let's start with five questions we could ask\nabout either the purported distinction between analytic and synthetic,\nor between a priori and a posteriori.\n\n1.  Is there a sensible distinction here?\n\n2.  Are there truths on either side of the line?\n\n3.  Does the distinction track something of independent significance?\n\n4.  Do all distinctively philosophical truths fall on one side of the\n    line?\n\n5.  Is the distinction relevant to philosophy?\n\nThe questions are obviously not independent; a negative answer to the\nfirst suggests that we better not offer a positive answer to any of the\nrest, for example. But there are more degrees of freedom here than might\nimmediately be apparent.\n\nA negative answer to the second question, for instance, need not imply a\nnegative answer to the first. If one held, with Phillip @Kitcher1980\nthat a priori warrant is by its nature indefeasible, and as a matter of\nfact no warrants are indefeasible, then one would think the a priori/a\nposteriori distinction is sensible, but in fact everything falls on one\nside of it.\n\nWith respect to the a priori/a posteriori distinction, I'll argue below\nthat while the answer to question 4 is clearly negative, the answer to\nquestion 5 is positive. The a priori/a posteriori distinction may be\nrelevant to philosophy even if it isn't relevant to, for example,\ndemarcating philosophy from non-philosophy. Alternatively, a positive\nanswer to question 5 may follow from a *negative* answer to one of the\nearlier questions. (@Williamson2013 suggests, but ultimately I think\ndoes not endorse, the view suggested in the following sentences.) If we\nlearned that all knowledge was a posteriori, i.e., that all knowledge\ndepended in an epistemologically significant way on experience, that\nwould be epistemologically interesting. So the distinction might have a\nvaluable role in articulating and perhaps defending a key philosophical\ninsight, even if all the actual cases fall on one side of the\ndistinction.\n\nThe point of raising these questions at the start is to ward off a\npossible confusion that can easily arise when discussing distinctions.\nIt is common to hear about 'attacks' on a distinction, or 'scepticism'\nabout a distinction, but a moment's reflection shows that it isn't clear\nwhat this comes to. I think that most of the 'attacks' on either of our\ntwo distinctions are arguments for a negative answer to one of these\nfive questions. (We'll see some instances of this as we go through the\nentry.) But different attackers may argue for different negative\nanswers, and different defenders defend different positive answers. So\nit is, I think, helpful to have these distinct questions in mind before\nwe begin.\n\n### The Traditional Notion of the A Priori {#thetraditionalnotionoftheapriori}\n\nThe traditional notion of the a priori makes the best sense, I think, if\nyou start with the following three assumptions.\n\n1.  There is a notion of justification that is distinct from, but a\n    constituent of, knowledge.\n\n2.  Whether a belief is justified, in this sense, depends just on the\n    evidence the believer has.\n\n3.  Evidence about the external world consists solely of perceptual\n    experiences.\n\nFrom 2 and 3 we get the idea that there could be some beliefs whose\njustification does not depend on any perceptual experience, i.e.,\nbeliefs that are justified by a null set of perceptual experiences.\nThese are the beliefs that are justified first, i.e., a priori. Then by\n1 we can say that these beliefs satisfy a part, possibly a large part,\nof the conditions for being knowledge. And this is the a priori\nknowledge.\n\nThe problem, as will probably be clear to most readers, is that all\nthree of the assumptions I started with are contentious. As noted in the\nintroduction, Linda @Zagzebski1994 has shown that there cannot be any\nnon-factive notion of justification that is a constituent of knowledge.\nTimothy @Williamson2000-WILKAI [Ch. 8] has argued convincingly against\nthe phenomenal account of evidence; our evidence consists of facts about\nthe world, not just facts about our experience. Point 2 is less clearly\nmistaken, but is still far from obvious. (See @ConeeFeldman2004 for a\nlong defence of point 2, as well as discussion of several problems with\nit.)\n\nOnce we drop the three ideas though, or even just the first and third,\nwhat could be left to say about the a priori? A natural first move is to\nthink about what *explains* a person's knowledge, rather than what\n*constitutes* it. On the classical picture I just sketched, Bob's\nknowledge that there are tigers nearby might be constituted by his\nexperience of hearing tiger-like growls. On that picture, having that\nexperience is (partially) constitutive of being justified in believing\nthat there are tigers nearby, and that justification is (partially)\nconstitutive of his knowing there are tigers nearby, and it is these\nconstitutive connections that make his knowledge a posteriori. We don't\nneed to make assumptions that are nearly so strong to conclude that the\nexperience partially *explains* his knowledge. The experience could\n(partially) explain why he is justified, without being any part of the\njustification, and the justification could (partially) explain why he\nknows, without being any part of the knowledge.\n\nBut there's a problem with this move too. I know that all tigers are\ntigers. On a standard view about the a priori, this will be a piece of a\npriori knowledge. But to explain why I have that knowledge, you have to\nappeal to some experiences I have had. After all, with no experiences, I\nwould not be able to think about tigers. So maybe nothing will end up a\npriori.\n\nThere's another usual response here. The experiences I have *enable* me\nto think about tigers, without doing anything to *justify* my belief\nthat all tigers are tigers. So maybe a priori knowledge is that\nknowledge where experiences do not play any justificatory role, although\nthey may play an enabling role.\n\nThat distinction between justifying and enabling will do a lot of work\nin what follows, so it is worth pausing over it. Perhaps we can say a\nbit more precisely what it means. An experience is a mere enabler if it\nexplains why a person knows that *p*, but not in virtue of explaining\nhow it is they can believe that *p*. I think something like that is\nplausibly true, but it still makes a rather large epistemological\nassumption, namely that justification is explanatorily prior to\nknowledge. That's something that will be rejected by those who accept\nthe 'knowledge first' epistemology of @Williamson2000-WILKAI.\n\nIf you don't accept that justification is explanatorily prior to\nknowledge, this route at least to articulating the difference between\nexperiences that enable, and experiences that justify, is closed off.\nAnd perhaps the enabling/justifying distinction is too obscure to do\nmuch work. That's what Williamson has recently argued, and in the next\nsection we'll look at his argument.\n\n### A Priori Knowledge and Practical Skills {#aprioriknowledgeandpracticalskills}\n\nThe a priori/a posteriori distinction, on the best way of freeing it\nfrom outdated epistemological assumptions, relies on the idea we can\nmake sense of the idea that some experiences are necessary for knowledge\nbecause they *enable* that knowledge, rather than that they *justify*\nthat knowledge. Timothy @Williamson2013 has argued that this distinction\nis too unclear to be useful, and as a result the a priori/a posteriori\ndistinction cannot do the work epistemologists need.\n\nI find the example Williamson uses, involving Norman and *Who's Who*\n [@Williamson2013 295], rather unintuitive, so I'll substitute a\ndifferent example that I think makes the same point. Diane is a great\nbasketball player. One of her great skills is being able to anticipate\nthe moves a defence will make, and responding with a move that will\nmaximise her team's chance of scoring. This is a skill she's honed\nthrough years of practice and competition. And her most common\nmanifestation of it comes in game situations, when she sees an opposing\ndefender and realizes what move will maximise her team's expected\npoints. But she can also manifest this skill 'off-line', when she\nconsiders conditional questions of the form *If the opposing team were\nto do this, what should I do?*.\n\nWilliamson notes that in some such cases, these questions will be solved\nthrough the use of imagination, which is surely right at least for some\nsense of 'imagination'. And in these cases, there won't be any\nparticular experience that justifies the answer. Yet Diane can acquire\nknowledge by these acts of the imagination. Is the knowledge she gets a\npriori or a posteriori? Williamson thinks there is no good answer to\nthis question, since Diane's experiences play a role in honing her\nskills that goes beyond the enabling role, but this role very different\nto the role experiences play in classical examples where we can point to\na particular experience that justifies the answer.\n\nNow it might seem that there's a simple move to make here. Diane's\nknowledge is obviously a posteriori because it is explained by her years\nof experience playing basketball. It is a case of (massive)\noverdetermination, but that doesn't mean the experiences collectively\nare not an essential part of the explanation. Williamson's response is\nthat if we go down this route, some paradigmatic instances of a priori\nreasoning will turn out to be a posteriori. For instance, our ability to\nengage in logical reasoning might turn out to be dependent on our\nability to track identity of objects (or even just terms) across time.\nIn general, this kind of response threatens to drive the a priori out of\nphilosophy altogether.[^4]\n\nThis is not, I hasten to note, Williamson's conclusion. Williamson\nthinks that some of our logical knowledge is a priori, and Diane's\nknowledge is a posteriori, but the salient explanations of how those\npieces of knowledge are obtained and sustained are similar in\nepistemologically salient respects. So he concludes the a priori/a\nposteriori distinction does not track anything of epistemological\nsignificance.\n\n### Innate Knowledge {#innateknowledge}\n\nIn the previous section we considered an argument that there is much\nless a priori knowledge than we usually assume. In this section we'll\nlook at an argument, tracing back to work by John @Hawthorne2007 that\nthere is a lot more a priori knowledge than we ever thought, in\nprinciple a lot lot more.\n\nRecall that we've argued, on pain of losing all a priori knowledge, that\nwe must understand a priori knowledge as knowledge that is in some sense\n*prior* to experience, not knowledge that is *independent* of\nexperience. So now consider beliefs that really are prior to experience,\nnamely innate beliefs. There is a lot of evidence that neonates have\ndifferential reaction to (right way up) human faces than they do to\nother objects. (See @Chien2011 and @HeronDelaney2011 for some recent\nstudies on this and citations to many more.) It is natural to explain\nthis by positing an internal representation in the neonate of the\nstructure of human faces; i.e., a belief about how human faces are\nstructured. Since these beliefs are true, and are in a good sense held\nbecause they are true, they seem to amount to knowledge. Yet they are\nclearly not grounded in, or explained by, the experiences of the\nneonate. So they look like a priori knowledge.\n\nThis is obviously very different to the standard conception of what is a\npriori knowledge. As we noted at the top, and will expand on in the next\nsection, there is a lot of interest in the possibility of a priori\nknowledge of contingent truths. But even the most enthusiastic\nsupporters of the a priori don't think we have a priori knowledge of\nfacial structure of conspecifics.\n\nThe problem is actually worse than this. We don't normally focus on what\nis actually known a priori, but what is a priori *knowable*. The reason\nfor this is fairly simple. Most of us cannot know complicated enough\nmultiplications without the aid of empirical evidence.[^5] But this\ndoesn't compromise the idea that mathematical truths are in a deep sense\na priori. That's because one could, in principle, know them a priori,\neven if creatures with small brains or limited skills need assistance\nfrom their perceptions.\n\nBut if that's right, then we can imagine creatures with all sorts of\ndifferent innate beliefs. Indeed, for any law about the world, we can\nimagine a creature who innately believes that law to hold, and whose\nbelief has the right kind of evolutionary explanation for it to count as\nknowledge. (Why the restriction to laws? Well, beyond that there might\nbe issues about whether the innate beliefs are accidentally true. In any\ncase, I'm not claiming that *only* laws could be known a priori this\nway.)\n\nThere isn't any obvious way out here. I think the best thing to do is to\nsay that when we say that something is a priori knowable, we have to\nmean that it is a priori knowable for creatures like us. That rules out\nthe possibility of having all the laws be a priori, but at the cost of\nmaking some arithmetic truths a posteriori.\n\nThe arguments by Williamson and Hawthorne I've discussed in the last two\nsections challenge the utility of the traditional notion of the a\npriori. But for the rest of this entry I'll set them aside, and discuss\nwhat ways we might modify, or use, the traditional notion should we find\nresponses to these challenges.\n\n### Substantive A Priori {#substantiveapriori}\n\nAs we noted in the introduction, a common thread through much of the\nhistory of this topic was a belief in a close relationship between a\npriority and necessity. Most writers take Kant to have treated them as\nco-extensive notions, the positivists thought they were identical, and\nQuine took them to suffer from similar defects. It is only with the\nexternalists that we see a gap appearing between the two.\n\nEven once the externalists appear, the gap is not as wide as it may be\nfor two interlocking reasons. The first is that the argument from\nexternalism to the existence of the necessary a posteriori is clearer\nthan the argument from externalism to the existence of the contingent a\npriori. The second is that externalism may only give a 'shallow'\ndistinction between necessity and a priority. Let's take these in turn.\n\nAssuming externalism, we can identify examples of the necessary a\nposteriori by using familiar natural kind terms. To take a famous\nexample, it is necessary and a posteriori that water is H$_2$O. It is\nharder to even identify the contingent a priori. The rough idea is clear\nenough. We take the characteristics by which ordinary language users\nidentify water, and say it is a priori that water has those\ncharacteristics. But what are those characteristics? Water is the stuff\nwhich falls from the sky, fills the rivers, lakes and oceans, and so on.\nIs any one of these a priori? Not really. It could turn out that nothing\nhad all these properties. (Is it really water in the oceans anyway, or\nis salt water a different substance?) So we could introduce a new term,\n@Chalmers1996 suggests 'watery', for the long disjunction of\nconjunctions of properties that a substance must have if we are to\nidentify it as water. Perhaps we come up with a list such that *Water is\nwatery* will be a priori, though since H$_2$O need not have been watery,\nit will be contingent. Note we will, at the least, have to introduce new\nvocabulary to identify this kind of contingent a priority.\n\nThe other worry is that the gap opened up here is 'shallow' in the sense\nof Gareth @Evans1979. Given the way things turned out, water must be\nH$_2$O. But in some intuitive sense, things could have turned out\ndifferently. (I'm taking the helpful locution 'could have turned out'\nfrom @Yablo2002.) It could have turned out that the stuff in the rivers,\noceans etc was XYZ. So while it is necessary that water is H$_2$O, it\ncould have turned out that this not only wasn't necessary, it wasn't\neven true. If that all sounds plausible to you, you may well think that\nthe a priori truths are all and only those truths which couldn't have\nturned out to be false. This way of thinking is behind the important\n*two-dimensionalist* approach. Important works in this tradition, as\nwell as @Evans1979, include @Davies1980, @Chalmers1996 and\n@Jackson1998.\n\nNow there are significant challenges facing two-dimensionalists, several\nof which are set out in @Block1999-BLOCAD. But my sense is that several\nof these challenges are very similar to the challenges facing anyone\ntrying to get an argument from semantic externalism to the contingent a\npriori. If we could say more clearly what it is for something to be\nwatery, it would be easier to say whether a particular world is one\nwhere water turned out to be XYZ. So I suspect if externalism gives us a\nreason to believe in the contingent a priori, it will be a fairly\nshallow distinction. (This doesn't extend to the argument from\nexternalism to the necessary a posteriori; we don't need to shore up\ntwo-dimensionalism to say that *Water contains oxygen* is necessary a\nposteriori.)\n\nBut that's not the only way that a priority might outrun necessity. In\nrecent years there has been a surge of interest in the idea that we can\nknow a priori various anti-sceptical propositions. This idea was\nadvanced in detail by John @Hawthorne2002, and then suggested as a way\nout of sceptical problems by Roger @White2006 and Brian @WeathersonSRE.\n\nRecently, Stewart @Cohen2010 and Sinan @Dogramaci2010 have suggested\nthat (assuming inductive scepticism is false), we can use ampliative\ninferential steps in suppositional reasoning. That is, if it possible to\ninductively infer $B$ when we know $A$, it is possible to infer $B$ on\nthe supposition that $A$, and go on to infer the material conditional\n$A \\supset B$. That conditional will be contingent if the inference was\nampliative, but since we've discharged the only supposition we used, it\ncould be a priori in a good sense. I have doubts about this route to the\ncontingent a priori  [@Weatherson2012-WEAIAS], but I think the general\nidea is plausible.\n\nTo make things more concrete, consider 'bubble worlds'. A bubble world\nconsists of a person, and the space immediately around them. If you\nthink that evidence supervenes on sensory irritation, then you have a\nduplicate in a bubble world who has the same evidence as you.[^6] But\nyou're not in a bubble world, and you know it. There's a well known\nprobabilistic argument that your evidence can't be grounds for ruling\nout possibilities that entail you have just that evidence.[^7] So your\nevidence doesn't rule out that you're in a bubble world. But you know\nyou're not. Hence that knowledge is a priori. So *I'm not in a bubble\nworld* might be contingent a priori.[^8] Moreover, it's not a 'shallow'\ncontingency. It could have turned out that you were in a bubble world.\nIndeed, with some more evidence you might even know this.\n\nI'm not going to defend here the claim that it's contingent a priori\nthat you're not in a bubble world. Indeed, I don't even believe the\nprobabilistic argument for that conclusion that I just referenced. But\nit is worth noting this trend towards taking seriously the possibility\nof substantive a priori knowledge.\n\n### The A Priori In Philosophy {#theaprioriinphilosophy}\n\nI've argued so far that the best sense we can make of the a priori\nallows for a lot of a priori knowledge. Once we realise that a priori\nknowledge, like any other kind of knowledge, is defeasible, and\nfallible, it seems possible that an agent could have a lot of\nfoundational knowledge of contingent matters. And that foundational\nknowledge does seem to be a priori. Of course, such an agent would not\nbe very much like *us*; so there is still a question of what agents like\nus could know a priori. And it might seem that the class of such pieces\nof knowledge might be relatively small and interesting.\n\nIn particular, one might think that philosophical knowledge, or at least\nsome interesting part of philosophical knowledge, might be a priori.\nHerman @Cappelen2012 notes that a wide range of philosophers, with very\ndifferent commitments, end up with the view that the a priori has a\ndistinctive role to play in philosophy. (See, especially, chapters 1 and\n6 of that book.) But, as Cappelen also shows, these philosophers are\nmistaken; outside perhaps of philosophical logic, the a priori doesn't\nhave a particularly special role to play in philosophical inquiry. We\ncan see this, I think, by working through one recent debate.\n\nTimothy @Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 noted that philosophical thought\nexperiments are almost always incomplete. The text of an example doesn't\nguarantee that conclusions that are usually drawn from it. To use his\nexample, to guarantee that the subject in one of Gettier's examples has\njustified beliefs (that don't amount to knowledge), we have to suppose\nthat there are no defeaters in the vicinity, but that isn't stated in\nthe example. Williamson's solution to this is that we should read the\nexample as a certain kind of counterfactual. What we know, Williamson\nargues, is that in the nearest world where the example was instantiated,\nthe subject would have justified true belief without knowledge. (I'm\nignoring here some complications involving names, and donkey anaphora,\nthat are not relevant to this debate.)\n\nJonathan Ichikawa and Benjamin Jarvis [-@IchikawaJarvis2009] object that\nthis makes philosophical knowledge a posteriori. We have to know what\nthe world is like to know what the nearest world in which the Gettier\ncase is instantiated is like. Ichikawa and Jarvis reject this because\nthey want to defend a \"traditional\" conception of thought experiments on\nwhich they provide a priori knowledge. I'm not convinced that this\nreally is part of philosophical tradition; it seems to me the thought\nexperiments in Hobbes, Hume, Mill and many others in the canon rely on\nempirical knowledge. But I won't press that point here. If one does want\nto avoid empirical knowledge coming in via the route Williamson\nsuggests, Ichikawa and Jarvis develop a nice way of doing so.\n\nThey say that thought experiments are little fictions. We need some\nempirical knowledge to interpret the fiction. But, they insist, once we\nare given the fiction, it is a priori that the fiction is possible, and\nthat in it the subject has a justified true belief without knowledge.\nAnd, note this point, it is a priori that these two facts entail that it\nis not necessary that all justified true beliefs amount to knowledge. On\nthe last point, they agree with Williamson. It is also a priori that if\nthe Gettier case could happen, and if it were to happen then there would\nbe justified true belief without knowledge, then it is not necessary\nthat all justified true beliefs are knowledge.\n\nBut let's try and generalise this to other thought experiments. Start,\nfor example, with the famous violinist described by @Thomson1971. That\nviolinist plays a key role in an argument whose conclusion is that\nabortion is often morally permissible. And one premise of the argument\nis something about an imagined violinist. Williamson will say that\npremise is an a posteriori counterfactual proposition. Ichikawa and\nJarvis will say it is an a priori proposition about what's true in a\nfiction. Perhaps there's another premise about the possibility of the\nexample, and maybe that's a priori too. But those premises don't come\nclose to supporting Thomson's conclusion. We need another premise about\nthe analogy between the violinist and a woman contemplating having an\nabortion to get Thomson's conclusion. Any such premise will not be a\npriori, unless some detailed facts about human biology are a priori.\nIt's a little tricky, but it isn't obvious the soundness of the\nabductive inference from those premises to Thomson's conclusion is a\npriori either. (See @PargetterBigelow1997 for some discussion of this\npoint.)\n\nI think Thomson's example is more typical of philosophical reasoning\nthan Gettier's. We don't just use thought experiments to dismiss\ntheories, like the JTB theory of knowledge. We also use them to defend\nphilosophical conclusions, such as the permissibility of abortion. And\nin general inferences from a thought experiment to the truth of a theory\nwill involve some a posteriori steps. So even if Ichikawa and Jarvis are\nright that we can know a lot about thought experiments a priori, it\nwon't follow that in general philosophical knowledge derived from\nthought experiments is a priori. Get away from special cases where the\nfacts about the thought experiment entail the philosophically\ninteresting result, and this should be reasonably clear.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there's no use for the a priori in philosophy. It\nmight be a very helpful concept to use in argument, even if it isn't\ntrue that our conclusions are generally a priori. I'll illustrate with\none example from my own work. One way to support the sceptical intuition\nthat we don't know we aren't brains in vats is to ask, how could one\npossibly know that? Rhetorical questions are not arguments, the received\nwisdom of undergraduates notwithstanding, so the sceptic needs to find\nsome way to extract argumentative force from that question. An\nattractive option is argue that *these* are all the ways to know\nsomething, and you can't know you're not a brain it a vat any of *these*\nways. Such an argument typically runs into problems at the first step;\narguing that one has exhausted all possible ways of getting knowledge is\nnot easy.\n\n@HumeTreatise had the best idea for how to overcome this step. Don't\nlist the ways someone can know something; use some property of knowledge\ngathering methods to partition the methods. Then argue that in no cell\nof the partition can one find a method that allows knowledge of the\nundesired kind. If the partition just consists of the presence or\nabsence of some property, you're guaranteed at least to have covered the\nfield. I've argued @Weatherson2007 that you get an interesting argument\nby letting the property in question be *is an a priori method*. By\n'interesting' I certainly don't mean sound. (And nor do I insist that\nHume equated interesting sceptical arguments with sound ones.) But I\nthink you get epistemological insight by thinking about whether\nknowledge that we're not brains in vats could be a priori, or could be a\nposteriori. You don't have to think that philosophical conclusions\nthemselves are a priori to think this could be a useful philosophical\napproach. That last point is probably obvious. We could have developed\nthe sceptical argument by asking whether knowledge of nonenvattedness is\ninnate or acquired. But suggesting that's an interesting argument\nwouldn't imply the very traditional view that philosophical knowledge is\ntypically innate.\n\n### Metaphysical Accounts of Analyticity {#metaphysicalaccountsofanalyticity}\n\nLet's turn now from the a priori to the analytic. As we noted at the\nstart, the traditional notion is that a sentence is analytic iff it is\ntrue in virtue of meaning. And, as we saw at the end of the\nintroduction, this notion is complicated by the fact that traditional\ntheories of meaning conflated several things that should be kept\nseparate.\n\nPaul @Boghossian1996-BOGAR makes a distinction that has been highly\ninfluential between **metaphysical** and **epistemological** conceptions\nof analyticity, and I will follow many contemporary writers in splitting\nthe topic up in this way. The metaphysical conception is the one most\ncontinuous with the traditional notion of analyticity, and also the one\nleast popular with contemporary theorists, so we will start with that.\nIt is the notion that some sentences are true merely in virtue of their\nmeaning.\n\nBoghossian, following Quine, argues that this notion is either\nnonsensical or trivial. Consider a simple example of a putatively\nanalytic truth, say *Everything is self-identical*. Why is this true? In\npart, because it means that everything is self-identical. But that can't\nbe what we mean to say that it is analytic. *Paris is beautiful* is true\nin part because it means that Paris is beautiful, but that doesn't make\nthe sentence an analytic truth. What we need is that this is the only\nthing needed for the sentence to be true. And that isn't the case for\neither sentence. *Everything is self-identical* is true because of what\nit means and the fact that everything is indeed self-identical, and\n*Paris is beautiful* is true because of what it means and the fact that\nParis is indeed beautiful. We haven't yet found a difference between the\ntwo.\n\nIt might be easy to see a response here. Start with a less\ndiscriminating treatment of truth makers than I supposed in the previous\nparagraph. Say that a sentence is true in virtue of what it means, and\nthe way the world is. So both of our examples are true in virtue of\ntheir meaning and the way this world is. But for *Everything is\nself-identical*, it doesn't matter how the world actually is, any way it\ncould have been would have made the sentence true. The contribution of\nthe world is like the contribution of the 5 in *What is 0 times 5?* You\nneed a second number there, or the question doesn't make sense, but it\ndoesn't matter which. In some good sense, the 0 does all the work. (This\nexample, and most of the discussion in the rest of this section, lean\nheavily on chapter 2 of  [@Russell2008].)\n\nBut this won't do as a conception of analyticity either, because of the\nexamples of the necessary a posteriori. Consider the example *Gold has\natomic number 79*. It is true in virtue of what it means, thay gold has\natomic number 79, and how the world is. But it doesn't matter which\nworld we choose; in any world gold has atomic number 79. Yet it is not,\nintuitively, analytic.\n\nRussell suggests a solution to this problem that draws on the\ndevelopments in externalist theories of meaning that we discussed in the\nintroduction. Start with the following three way distinction. (These\ndefinitions are a quote from page x of  [@Russell2008].)\n\n-   **Character**: The thing speakers must know (perhaps tacitly) to\n    count as understanding an expression.\n\n-   **Content**: What the word contributes to what a sentence containing\n    it says (the proposition it expresses).\n\n-   **Reference Determiner**: A condition which an object must meet in\n    order to be the reference of, or fall in the extension of, an\n    expression.\n\nThese can all come apart. In the case of pure indexicals like *I*, the\ncontent comes apart from the character and reference determiner in\nfamiliar ways. But it is tempting in those cases to equate character and\nreference determiner. What makes it the case that a token of *I* picks\nout me is that I use it, and that relation between usage and content is\nwhat someone must know to understand the term. But that's an all too\nspecial case. I can be a competent user of the name 'Alex' as a name for\nmy friend Alex without knowing whether she got that name at birth in the\nnormal way, or knowing whether she acquired it later. Competence may\nrequire that I know the reference of Alex was somehow determined to be\nher, but I need not know what that reference determiner was.\n\nMoreover, the character and reference determiner relate to contexts in\ndifferent ways. It is a familiar point that a sentence like *If you were\nspeaking, I would have been speaking* may be false. That's because when\nwe evaluate the *I* in the consequent, we don't look to who the speaker\nis in the context of evaluation, i.e., the world where you are speaking,\nbut to the world of utterance, i.e., the context of my utterance. Just\nlike this familiar distinction between contexts of utterance and\ncontexts of evaluation, Russell requires us to think about contexts of\nintroduction. An example helps bring this out.\n\nSay I, on Monday, introduce the name 'Inigo' for the shortest sword\nfighter. When the name is used on Tuesday, it need not pick out the\nshortest sword fighter even in the context of utterance. Inigo might\nhave grown, or a shorter person may have taken up sword fighting. Of\ncourse, when I use the name in counterfactuals, it might pick out\nsomeone who was never a sword fighter. So we to distinguish the context\nthe term was introduced in, in this case Monday, from the context it is\nuttered in, in this case Tuesday.\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, we can give Russell's first pass at a\ndefinition of analyticity.\n\n> A sentence *S* is true in virtue of meaning just in case for all pairs\n> of context of introduction and context of utterance, the proposition\n> expressed by *S* with respect to those contexts is true in the context\n> of evaluation. [@Russell2008 56]\n\nThis will, says Russell, solve the problem about gold. It is true that\nwhen someone now utters *Gold has atomic number 79*, they express a\nnecessary truth. But we could have introduced the terms in the very same\nway, and had the world not cooperated, this sentence would have been\nfalse. Indeed, Russell splits analyticity from necessity twice over. She\nthinks that *I am here now* will be analytic in this sense though it\nexpresses a contingent proposition.\n\nThis does rely on understanding what it is for terms in different worlds\nto have the same reference determiner. Perhaps one could object that had\nwe been pointing at something else when we introduced the term *gold*,\nwe would have been using a crucially different reference determiner. But\nthe issues here about the metaphysics of words and demonstrations, are\nsubtle, and Russell's view that the same reference determiner could\ndetermine different contents in different worlds seems plausible.\n\nRussell says that this is a perfectly good notion of truth in virtue of\nmeaning. Of course, as she says, it is really a kind of truth in virtue\nof what determines meaning, not meaning itself. Reference determiners\nare part of meta-semantics, not semantics. But that seems continuous\nenough with the tradition. And there is no reason to think that analytic\nsentences, so understood, will be epistemologically distinctive. In this\nrespect we may end up agreeing with the primary conclusion of the\ndiscussion of metaphysical analyticity in chapter 3 of\n@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17, namely that it isn't directly relevant to\nphilosophical methodology. But it could be an interesting notion in its\nown right, and as discussed in the previous section, it could be\nphilosophically useful without playing its traditional role.\n\nI have considerably simplified the presentation of Russell's view,\nhowever. The definition so far implies that some theorems of geometry,\nand perhaps fundamental laws of ethics, will be analytic. Like Kant,\nRussell wants these to be synthetic. Her solution is to say that\nanalytic truths must not just satisfy the constraint given above, but\nthat they must do so because the reference determiners of their parts\nstand in the right kind of containment relations. But spelling this part\nof her view out will take too much space, so instead I'll close with a\ndiscussion of epistemological analyticity.\n\n### Epistemological Accounts of Analyticity {#epistemologicalaccountsofanalyticity}\n\nIn a series of influential articles, Paul [@Boghossian1996-BOGAR;\n@Boghossian1997; @Boghossian2003-BOGEAA] argued that we should accept\nthat Quine's argument against metaphysical versions of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction, but that Quine's arguments left\nuntouched an **epistemic** understanding of the distinction. On this way\nof understanding the distinction, a sentence is analytic iff it is\nknowably true merely in virtue of understanding it. Consider, for\ninstance, this sentence.\n\n(E)\n:    If frogs bark and ducks howl, then frogs bark.\n\nNow make the following four assumptions.\n\n1.  Understanding the non-logical terms in (E) suffices to see it is of\n    the form $(A \\wedge B) \\rightarrow A$.\n\n2.  For logical terms like $\\wedge$ and $\\rightarrow$, understanding\n    involves accepting, perhaps implicitly in one's inferential\n    practices, the basic introduction and elimination rules they\n    license.\n\n3.  For $\\wedge$, the basic rules are the familiar introduction and\n    elimination rules.\n\n4.  For $\\rightarrow$, the basic rules are modus ponens and conditional\n    proof.\n\nThen anyone who understands (E) is in a position to prove it to be true\nby a trivial three line proof. Generalizing this example, we can get an\nargument that all logically true sentences are analytic. Generalizing a\nbit further, we may be able to argue that the propositions they express\nare a priori knowable, but this requires resolving many of the issues we\nhave already discussed in the discussion of the a priori, and I will set\nit aside for the remainder of this entry.[^9]\n\nThe problem we will focus on is that assumptions 2 and 4, and hence\npresumably 3, are not clearly true. Actually 4 as stated is almost\nsurely false. If the basic rules for $\\rightarrow$ are modus ponens and\nconditional proof, then $\\rightarrow$ is material implication. But\n$\\rightarrow$ was meant to be our symbol for natural language 'if',\nwhich is not material implication. So the rule must be something else.\nIt isn't clear what this rule could be. It is plausible that we can use\na restricted version of conditional proof when reasoning about 'if',\nsuch as a version which requires that there be no undischarged\nassumptions when we apply conditional proof. That will make the proof of\n(E) go through, but it is unlikely to be a basic rule in the relevant\nsense, since it does not combine with an elimination rule (i.e., modus\nponens) to pick out a unique meaning for 'if'.\n\nDisagreement about the introduction rule for 'if' is endemic to the\nliterature on conditionals. But there is almost a consensus that the\nelimination rule is modus ponens. Almost, but not quite - Vann\n@McGee1985 is a notable dissenter. Timothy @Williamson2007-WILTPO-17\n uses the existence of notable dissenters like McGee to mount a\nsustained assault on Boghossian's position. It is a consequence of the\nassumptions we have made, and which Boghossian needs, that anyone who\ndoesn't accept modus ponens does not understand 'if'. But that seems\nimplausible. By any familiar standard, McGee understands conditionals\nquite well. Indeed, he is an expert on them.\n\nThis point generalizes, as Williamson stresses. On the inferentialist\nview about the meaning of logical terms, in any debate about the\ncorrectness of fundamental logical principles, either one party doesn't\nunderstand the key terms, or the parties are speaking at cross purposes.\nThe intuitionist mathematician endorses the sentence \"All functions are\ncontinuous\", and the classical mathematician rejects it. But it isn't\nplausible that one party fails to understand 'all', 'functions' or\n'continuous', or that they are speaking at cross purposes in that they\nare assigning different meanings to one of these terms. (I'm assuming\nthe context makes it clear that both parties are speaking of functions\nwhose domain is the reals, and whose range is subset of the reals.) I've\nused an example from real analysis, but we could make the same point\nless pithily using Pierce's Law if we wanted to stick to propositional\nlogic.\n\nI'll close with two replies on behalf of the defending of epistemic\nanalyticity, and some reasons for being dissatisfied with each. The\ndiscussion will follow somewhat the recent exchange between\n@Boghossian2011-BOGWOT and @Williamson2011-WILRTB-3.\n\nThe first response says that we shouldn't have said if a sentence is\nepistemically analytic, then *understanding* it is sufficient for\nknowing that a sentence is true. Rather, we should have said that\n*knowing the meaning* is sufficient for knowing the sentence is true.\nNotably, Boghossian does not make this defence in his exchange with\nWilliamson, so it seems he accepts that Williamson was right to take\nepistemic analyticity to involve a connection between understanding and\nknowability. And this seems to be right. Consider again *Water contains\noxygen*. In one sense of meaning, the meaning of 'water' is H$_2$O. So\nanyone who knows what 'water' means in that sense knows that *Water\ncontains oxygen* is true. But it doesn't feel like this claim is\nanalytic, especially not in the epistemic sense that interests\nBoghossian. It is possible that there is some other sense of meaning\nthat will be more useful for Boghossian's project, but it isn't clear\nthat knowing the meaning in this other sense will differ particularly\nfrom understanding.\n\nThe second response, and one that Boghossian has used on several\noccasions, is that the only plausible theory of meaning for the logical\nconnectives is inferentialist, and on an inferentialist theory of\nmeaning it will be true that anyone who understands a connective is\ndisposed to reason correctly with it. That last sentence is deliberately\nsloppy, much more so than any statement of the response in Boghossian's\nown work. But the sloppiness is there because it makes a potential\nequivocation more easily visible.\n\nConsider a theory that says the meaning of a logical connective is\neither constituted by, or at least constitutively connected to, its\nappropriate inferential rules. But to understand the term is not to\ngrasp the meaning in this sense, any more than to understand the term\n'water' one has to know it is H$_2$O. Rather, understanding involves\nparticipating in the right kind of way in a social practice, and it is\nthat social practice (plus perhaps some facts about the nature of logic,\nif such facts there be) that determines the appropriate inferential\nrules for the connective.\n\nIs the theory in the previous paragraph inferentialist? If not, then it\nis false that no theory other than inferentialism is plausible as an\naccount of the meaning of the logical connectives. For this kind of\nsocialised theory of meaning is, it seems to me, highly plausible.\n(@Williamson2011-WILRTB-3 notes that a socialised theory of meaning for\nthe connectives is plausible, though I don't think he would sign up for\nthe view that the result of such socialization is a theory in terms of\ninferential rules.) If, on the other hand, the theory is inferentialist,\nthen it doesn't follow that understanding requires a disposition to use\nthe rules. Perhaps understanding requires being part of a community many\nmembers of which have the appropriate dispositions, but it does not\nrequire that any one member have these dispositions. So it won't be true\nthat mere understanding puts one in a position to know. At best,\nunderstanding a logical truth means one is in a community in which some\npeople are in a position to the sentence is true. But that doesn't do\nmuch to rescue the notion of epistemic analyticity.\n\n[^1]: Actually, the history of what pre-positivist empiricists believed\n    about mathematics is a little more complicated than the standard\n    story. See @Whitmore1945 for some details.\n\n[^2]: The next few sentences follow the arguments of @Sober2000 fairly\n    closely.\n\n[^3]: This paragraph follows closely the discussion of Quine in\n    @Russell2008.\n\n[^4]: Note this argument is distinct from the argument\n    @Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 makes about the role of knowledge of\n    counterfactuals in philosophical reasoning, and its implications for\n    the a priori status of philosophical knowledge. We'll return to that\n    argument, and the response by @IchikawaJarvis2009 below. The key\n    point is that this argument only turns on the idea that\n    philosophical reasoning might rest on empirically acquired and honed\n    skills.\n\n[^5]: I think that when one carries out multiplication by hand, using\n    the techniques taught at school, the marks on the paper play a\n    justifying and not an enabling role. But arguing for that would be\n    beyond the scope of this entry. It should be less controversial that\n    multiplications carried out by machine give us a posteriori\n    knowledge of the answer.\n\n[^6]: If you prefer a wider conception of evidence, so that for instance\n    two people who are looking at distinct duplicates have distinct\n    evidence, just make the bubble a little bigger, and this argument\n    will still go through.\n\n[^7]: See @White2006. David Jehle and I have argued that this argument\n    uses distinctively classical logical principles in a way that might\n    be problematic  [@JehleWeatherson]. And I've argued that even slight\n    weakenings of the assumptions about how to update credences make the\n    argument fail.  [@Weatherson2007].\n\n[^8]: I'm assuming here that the semantic response to scepticism, as\n    defended by  [@Putnam1981], doesn't work for ruling out bubble\n    worlds. Defending this assumption would take us too far from the\n    current topic.\n\n[^9]: There is an interesting worry around here that the three-line\n    argument for (E) is circular, and so cannot justify (E), and this\n    fact undermines Boghossian's argument that it is a priori. See\n    @Ebert2005 and @Jenkins2008-JENBAE for two ways of developing this\n    worry.\n\n\n",
