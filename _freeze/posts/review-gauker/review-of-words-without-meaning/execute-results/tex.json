Some theories are too obscure or\ntoo fantastic to be named. And occasionally a theory is too deeply\nentrenched to even be conceptualised as a theory. For example, many of\nus hold without thinking about it the theory that \"the central function\nof language is to enable a speaker to reveal his or her thoughts to a\nhearer,\" (3) that in the case of declarative utterances the thoughts in\nquestion are beliefs whose content is some proposition or other, and\nthat hearers figure out what the content of that belief is by virtue of\nan inference that turns on their beliefs about the meanings of the words\nwe use. These claims might seem too trivial to even be called a theory.\nThey have seemed too trivial to draw an *ism*. Christopher Gauker calls\nthem 'the received view', and the purpose of his book *Words Without\nMeanings* (all page references to this book) is to argue against this\nreceived view and propose an alternative theory in its place. In\nGauker's theory the primary function of language is social coordination.\nIf language ever functions as a conduit to the mind, this is a secondary\neffect.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in [Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews](https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/words-without-meaning/).\n</aside>\n\nIt is useful to have an *ism* for everything, so let's call 'the\nreceived view' *Lockism*, since Locke believed something similar. Of\ncourse, Locke probably didn't have any detailed opinions about where the\nsemantics/pragmatics distinction lies or what the role and importance\nHorn scales might be or how to build a compositional semantics for\nquantification, or indeed about many of the issues on which various\ncontemporary Lockists have their most distinctive views, but there's an\nintellectual legacy worth noting. Still, if Locke was a Lockist without\nhaving views on these matters, this starts to suggest how broad, and how\ndivided, the Lockist church may be. Lockists need not agree on the\nsemantic analyses of indicative conditionals or attitude reports. They\nneed not even agree on whether there are such things as conventional\nimplicatures or deep structures. An argument against Lockism will have\nto either focus on the few rather platitudinous points where Lockists\nagree, or try to respond to all the ways Lockists might develop their\nposition. Gauker takes both options throughout his book. The central\ntheses of the Lockist position that are attacked concern the nature and\ncontents of beliefs, the nature of logical implication and the status of\ntruth. Gauker's attacks on Lockist theories of quantifier domain\nrestriction and of presupposition rely more heavily on attacking all the\nvariants of Lockism.\n\nBut the arguments against Lockism are not necessarily the most important\nparts of the book. Alongside the criticisms of Lockism, Gauker develops\nin great detail his own positive theory about the nature and role of\nlinguistic communication. Gauker suggests \"the primary function of\nassertions \\... is to shape the manner in which interlocutors attempt to\nachieve their goals.\" (52) Conversations do not take place in a vacuum.\nConversants frequently talk because they want something. The world does\nnot always make it easy for us to get what we want, but sometimes at\nleast other people can tell us which ways work best.\n\nIt becomes crucial to Gauker's theory here that certain actions are or\nare not in accord with certain sets of sentences. Given this idea the\nprimary norm of conversation becomes: *Say things such that others who\nact in accord with what you say, and with what else has been said, will\nachieve their goals*. The concept of actions according with (sets of)\nsentences seems intuitive at first. If my goal is to download the new\nMatrix movie, then going to stealthatmovie.com is in accord with {'The\nnew Matrix movie is available at stealthatmovie.com'} while going to\nmoviebootlegger.com, or anywhere else, is not. (These are, by the way,\nfake site names.) Given this idea of actions according with sets of\nsentences, we can then define the *context*, or set of relevant\nsentences, as the smallest set such that \"all courses of action in\naccordance with it relative to the goal of the conversation are good\nways of achieving the goal\". (56) We can then restate the primary norm\nas: *Say things that are in the context*. Those sentences will be useful\nto say, and their negations will be useful to deny. This idea of useful\nassertability becomes crucial to Gauker's theory, often playing much the\nrole that a Lockist has truth play. For example, validity gets defined\nin terms of assertability preservation in all contexts.\n\nClearly the concept of actions according with contexts given goals is\nquite crucial, but there's less explication of it than we might hope. I\nhave some idea what it might mean to say that my going to\nstealthatmovie.com accords with the *proposition* that the new Matrix\nmovie is available at stealthatmovie.com, and I have some idea which\nfacts in the world may make this true. But I don't have as clear an idea\nabout what it means to say this action accords with any *sentence*.\nSentences are just marks on paper, or sound waves. We can be pretty sure\nthat this accord between actions and marks on paper is not a *primitive*\nfact about the world. Lockists think that actions accord with sentences\nbecause sentences express propositions and some actions accord with\npropositions. But this isn't Gauker's account, and it isn't clear what\nis. At one stage Gauker notes that the distinction between actions that\naccord with a context and those that do not will be primitive relative\nto the 'fundamental norms of discourse', which are the primary focus of\n*Words Without Meanings*. That sounds right, and I hope it's a sign that\nwe'll see more details about the concept of accord in future work.\n\nThis issue though is important because there are a few reasons to worry\nabout how the concept of accord will be explicated. First, whatever\nproblems face Lockist theories of meaning, including some of the\nproblems Gauker raises, may recur here. Second, some theories of accord\nwill introduce entities that are functionally just like meanings, so if\nmeaning is a functional concept, as seems plausible, those theories will\nnot end up being theories of words without meaning. Third, as Gauker\nnotes, there are serious epistemological questions about how we could\never learn which actions accord with which contexts relative to which\ngoals. Those who are impressed by Fodor's arguments for the\nsystematicity of human linguistic competence will probably think these\nquestions raise insuperable difficulty for anything like Gauker's\nprogram. On the other hand, those that are impressed by Gauker's program\nwill probably find these Fodorian claims overstated.\n\n*Words Without Meaning* concludes with three chapters setting out a\nrather distinctive view of belief. Gauker argues that a complete account\nof the role of belief ascriptions should be sufficient for a theory of\nbelief. This is not because of a general policy that explaining the talk\nabout something is sufficient to explain the thing in general. Such a\npolicy is not entirely antithetical to Gauker's overall picture, but it\nwould be hard to defend in all cases. Rather, Gauker argues, in practice\nwe have little use for beliefs and desires other than in our ascriptions\nof them, so an account of their ascription is all the account we need.\nMany philosophers will baulk here, because they think folk psychology\nprovides a crucial role for beliefs and desires. Since folk psychology\nis a crucial part of how we predict the actions of other people, and of\nhow we explain their actions, there is an important aspect of the\n*nature* of beliefs and desires that a mere account of their ascriptions\nwill not capture. These philosophers will not agree with Gauker that an\n\"account of the attribution of beliefs and desires is already an account\nof [their] nature.\" (271‑2)\n\nGauker's response to these philosophers is to question the explanatory\nand predictive capacity of folk psychology. He argues first that the\nexplanatory, and especially the predictive, power of folk psychology is\nmuch over-rather. And more importantly, he argues that when there do\nappear to be good folk psychological explanations or predictions, there\nare equally good explanations that do not appeal to beliefs and desires.\nThe argument for this involves running through several cases with some\ncare, but very roughly the common theme is that beliefs and desires (if\nthey exist) are themselves capable of explanation, so at least most of\nthe time we can replace an explanation in terms of beliefs and desires\nwith one that appeals to the explanations of those very beliefs and\ndesires. This gives us a fairly general strategy for dispensing with\nfolk psychological concepts in explanation and prediction.\n\nThis does not mean that we adopt an error theory of belief or desire\nascriptions. Gauker thinks these have a use, so they are properly\nassertable. Their role, in general, is to let us speak on behalf of\nother people. \"The primary function of attributions of belief and desire\nis to extend the range of participation in conversation.\" (226) When I\nsay that Harry believes that tech stocks are good investments, I say *on\nHarry's behalf* that tech stocks are good investments. Unfortunately, we\nnever get a complete positive characterisation of when it is permissible\nto say something on Harry's behalf. We are told that such assertions,\nlike all assertions, must be relevant to the conversation, but beyond\nthat not a lot. We are told that it can't just be permissible to say\nthis just in case Harry would be disposed to say it, were he here. Harry\nmight have a habit of keeping his investment ideas to himself, but still\nbelieve that tech stocks are good investments. And we're told that this\ncan be permissible to say even if Harry has never made an 'inner\nassertion' that tech stocks are good investments. But this doesn't\namount to a positive characterisation. Further, it's not clear how to\nextend this account to all attitude reports, especially reports of\ndesire-like attitudes. One could truly say *Brian wants to play for the\nRed Sox*, but in doing so one is not making a command, or even a\nrequest, on my behalf.\n\nAs well as these intriguing positive proposals, there are several\narguments against Lockism. Chapter 2, on mental representation, is an\nattack on the Lockist position that there are beliefs with propositional\ncontent. Gauker first notes that any attempt to provide an atomistic\ntheory of mental content seems to run into insuperable counterexamples.\nThe main focus is Fodor's asymmetric dependence theory, but a few other\natomist theories are raised and dismissed. Gauker suggests that holistic\ntheories are a little more promising, but when we look at the details we\nsee that these all fall to a version of Putnam's model-theoretic\nargument. Gauker's argument here differs from Putnam's in two key\nrespects. First, it concerns primarily mental content, rather than\nlinguistic content. Second, it has fewer theoretical overheads. Gauker\nshows that the argument never really needed any complicated mathematics;\nthe formalism in the standard semantics for first-order logic is quite\nsufficient. Despite those two differences, the argument is fairly\nfamiliar, and the moves that could be made in response are also, by now,\nfairly familiar. Gauker quickly surveys these moves, and notes why he\nthinks none of them work, but the survey will probably be too brief to\nconvince many who are happy with their preferred reply to Putnam. Those\nwho are not happy with any of the replies to Putnam, or who would be\nmore impressed by a version of Putnam's argument that did not drift into\nneedless technicality, should enjoy Gauker's argument.\n\nThe middle half of *Words Without Meanings* consists of six case studies\ndesigned to show that Gauker's approach can solve problems that are\nintractable for Lockism. Three of these are described as being in\npragmatics, the other three in semantics. Here Gauker more often has to\nrevert to arguing against each of the different versions of Lockism in\nthe literature, for there are few points of agreement among Lockists\nonce we get to the details on how language works. This is particularly\nclear when we look at pragmatics. I guess most Lockists agree that there\nis a pragmatics/semantics distinction, and most of those who do agree\nthink that there is such a thing as scalar implicature. Beyond that\nthere are disagreements everywhere. So Gauker is more often required to\nargue against all the versions of Lockism in existence. Even if he\nsucceeds against all of them, Lockism is a growing doctrine, and a smart\nLockist could often take Gauker's positive ideas and incorporate them\ninto Lockism. So it's not clear we'll see any *knock-down* argument\nagainst Lockism here. But maybe there will be an interesting abductive\nargument develop, and in any case it is always worthwhile to see\nGauker's positive account. Space prevents a full discussion of many of\nthe issues raised here, but I'll provide a quick summary of the salient\nissues, and why Gauker thinks he has an advantage over his Lockist\nrivals.\n\nThe first case study concerns domains of discourse, which mostly means\ndomains of quantification. To use Gauker's example, imagine Tommy runs\ninto Suzy's room, where Suzy is playing with her marbles, and says \"All\nthe red ones are mine.\" What determines the domain of Tommy's\nquantifier? If it is what Tommy intends, then we might end up saying\nthat his sentence is, surprisingly, true. For Tommy, it turns out,\nintends only to speak of the marbles in his room, which are as it turns\nout all his. But if we don't take it to be what Tommy intends, and\ninstead let the domain be set by what Suzy thinks the domain is, or what\na reasonable hearer would think the domain is, then we undermine the\nLockist picture that the role of language is for the *speaker's*\nthoughts to be communicated. In these cases it is the thoughts of the\nhearer, or of a reasonable hearer, seem to determine the meaning of what\nis said. Gauker suggests it is better to say that the domain is the\nclass of things that are relevant to the goal of the conversation that\nTommy and Suzy are having.\n\nThe second case concerns presupposition. Allegedly, some sentences are\nsuch that they cannot be properly asserted or denied unless some\ncondition, the presupposition, is met. Sentences containing factive\nattitude verbs are sometimes held to fall into this category. So I\ncannot affirm or deny *I regret that you failed the test* unless you\nfailed the test. There are several Lockist theories of presupposition,\nbut Gauker argues that none of them can satisfactorily explain how\nasserting such sentences can inform the hearer of the truth of the\npresupposition, in this case that the test was in fact failed. Gauker's\ntheory, which does not have a special category of truth conditions apart\nfrom assertability conditions, does not have this difficulty. For a\nsimilar reason, however, the Lockist theory that rejects the concept of\npresupposition also avoids any problem of informative presupposition.\n\nThe third case concerns Gricean implicature. Gauker notes, correctly,\nthat we can well explain the effects of Gricean implicature without\npresuming that the hearer even contemplates what the speaker had in mind\nin speaking. But this kind of contemplation is essential to Grice's\nofficial story. Gauker's alternative suggestion is that we can explain\nnon-literal communication by assuming the hearer draws inferences about\nthe context from the assertability of what is actually said.\n\nThe next three case studies are classified as 'Semantics', so we might\nhope that here Lockists will present a more unified target. But two of\nthe studies seem, from a Lockist perspective, to concern the\nsemantics/pragmatics boundary, so again there will be several varieties\nof Lockism that need to be addressed.\n\nThe first semantics study concerns quantifiers. Gauker argues that in\npractice (1) is a bad argument form, (1a) for instance is invalid, while\n(2) is a good argument form.\n\n1. Everything is F. Therefore, a is F.\n1a. Everything is made of wood. Therefore, Socrates is made of wood.\n2. a is F. Therefore, something is F.\n\nGauker argues in some detail that various Lockist theories of quantifier\ndomain restriction cannot explain the asymmetry here. On his theory, the\nasymmetry falls out quite naturally, since quantification is always over\nnamed objects, and once named an object is relevant. So (1) need not be\nvalid, since a need not have been named, but (2) must be valid.\n\nThe last two case studies are the most interesting, and the most\nintricate. I can't do justice in a small space to the details of\nGauker's theory, but I'll say a little about the issues raised. Chapter\n8 concerns conditionals. Gauker thinks he has a telling argument against\na central Lockist claim. The primary intuition is that (3) and (4) are\nlogically equivalent, i.e. each entails the other, (at least when p and\nq are not themselves conditionals), but they are not equivalent when\nembedded in longer sentences. In particular, (5) and (6) need not be\nequivalent.\n\n3. Either not p or q\n4. If p then q\n5. Either not p or q, or r\n6. If p then q, or r\n\nIf this is right, then what Gauker calls 'the Equivalence Principle',\nthat substitution of logical equivalent constituents preserves\ntruth-conditional content, is false. Gauker suggests this is a serious\nproblem for Lockism. There are, however, a few Lockist theories in which\nEquivalence fails. For example, in classical supervaluationism, p or not\np is a logical truth, and p is equivalent to p is true, but p is true or\nnot p is not a logical truth. So some Lockists have learned to live\nwithout Equivalence. More importantly, the data that suggests that (3)\nand (4) are logically equivalent isn't unequivocal. Some Lockists have\nprovided arguments as to why (3) and (4) will usually have the same\nassertion conditions even though they have different truth conditions.\n(Gauker notes Robert Stalnaker's 1975 paper 'Indicative Conditionals'\nthat argues for this line.) If those arguments can be made to succeed,\nthen we can keep Equivalence by denying that (3) really *entails* (4).\n\nMore interesting than the possible Lockist replies is Gauker's own\ntheory. He manages, quite impressively I think, to provide a recursive\ndefinition of truth conditions for the connectives without keeping\nEquivalence. The rough idea is that *If p then q* is true iff p strictly\nimplies q relative to the context. Strict implication theories usually\nblock the inference from (5) to (6), as Gauker's does, but they also\nnormally block the inference from (3) to (4). In Gauker's theory,\nhowever, because entailment is defined in terms of\nassertability-preservation, and disjunctions can only be asserted if one\nor other disjunct is assertable in every possibility left open by the\ncontext, the inference from (3) to (4) is valid. Roughly, any\ncontextually salient possibility either contains not p or q, so all the\npossibilities that contain p contain q, in which case *If p then q* is\nassertable. This theory still has some counter-intuitive features, since\nthe paradoxes of material implication are still with us, but it's a\nfascinating addition to the literature on conditionals.\n\nThe final case study concerns truth, and in particular the semantic\nparadoxes. Gauker argues that extant Lockist responses to the paradoxes\nare not capable of handling metalinguistic versions of the paradox. In\nparticular, Lockist theories struggle with sentences like (7).\n\n7. (7) does not express a true sentence in this context.\n\nGauker's argument that his theory does better than the Lockist here has\ntwo parts. First, he has a detailed demonstration that it is impossible\nto infer a contradiction directly from (7) in his theory. Second, he\nargues that a Lockist explanation of what's going on with (7) has to\nposit that uttering, or writing, 'this context' changes the context.\nThis might be true, indeed Gauker endorses a similar claim in his\nresponse to the paradoxes. But on most Lockist accounts of what contexts\nare, we could replace the demonstrative with some other phrase that more\ndirectly picks out the context. For example if a context is just an\nordered n-tuple, we could just replace 'this context' with a description\nof the n-tuple that is, actually, the context. Here it does look as if\nGauker's theory has more resources than the traditional Lockism. It\nremains to be seen whether Gauker's theory is completely free from the\nparadoxes - it's quite a bit harder to come up with a consistent theory\nof truth than it is to block the liar paradox - but again Gauker\nprovides an interesting alternative to existing approaches, and one that\nexperts in the area should pay close attention.\n\nOverall, what should we make of *Words Without Meanings*? I think the\nbook has three major aims, and it succeeds in two of them. The first aim\nis to extend Gauker's preferred theory of linguistic communication to\nshow how it handles presupposition, quantification, conditionals,\nattitude reports and truth ascriptions. In this it succeeds quite well,\nespecially in showing how the project holds together technically. The\nsecond aim is to raise a host of problems for the Lockist theory,\nproblems that are deserving of serious consideration and response. And\nagain, there is no doubt it succeeds. Even if one thinks that all the\nproblems Gauker raises can be solved, having them set forth so sharply\ncertainly advances the debate. The third aim, the big one, is to\nconvince Lockists that their research program is moribund, and Gauker's\ncontextualist alternative is the way of the future. That aim, in short,\nis for a revolution in semantics. (And in any fields that presuppose\nLockist semantics. Many of our best syntactic theories have to be\nrevised if Gauker is correct.) Here I think the book is less successful,\nif only because the aim is so high. It's not clear how any short book,\nand the MIT series *Words Without Meaning* is in is clearly a series for\nshort books, could trigger such a revolution. Lockism may have its\nweaknesses, and Gauker shines a spotlight on a few, but it's been a\nrelatively productive program the last fifty years, so overthrowing it\nwill not be easy. Such a revolution would need a longer book, or books,\nanswering among other questions the metaphysical and epistemological\nquestions about Gauker's concept of actions according with sentences we\nnoted above. Gauker's work always leaves the impression that he has\nworked through the relevant material in much more detail than is\napparent from a superficial reading of the text, so such books and\npapers may well be in the pipeline. If one is already on Gauker's side\nin these disputes, one should heartily welcome the wealth of detail\n*Words Without Meaning* adds to his program. If one is more\nconservative, more orthodox, one should perhaps be worried about the\nanomalies rising, but not panicked. At least, not panicked *yet*.\n",
