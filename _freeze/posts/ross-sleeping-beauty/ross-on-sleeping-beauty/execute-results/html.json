The problem is that most arguments for that answer generalise in awkward ways when he looks at the whole class of what he calls Sleeping Beauty problems. In this note I develop a new argument for the thirder answer that doesn't generalise in this way.\ndate: March 1 2013\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1007/s11098-011-9827-x\"\ncategories:\n  - epistemology\n  - games and decisions\n  - notes\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-011-9827-x\njournal:\n    title: \"Philosophical Studies\"\n    publisher: \"Springer\"\nvolume: 163\nnumber: 3\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: eros.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 4\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nIn two excellent recent papers, [@Ross2010] and [@Ross2012], Jacob Ross\nhas argued that the standard arguments for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer\nto the Sleeping Beauty puzzle lead to violations of countable\nadditivity. The problem is that most arguments for the\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ answer generalise in awkward ways when he look at the\nwhole class of what he calls *Sleeping Beauty problems*.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophical Studies_ 155: 503-512.\n\nPicture via [The Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/254502).\n</aside>\n\n> Let us define a *Sleeping Beauty problem* as any problem in which a\n> fully rational agent, Beauty, will undergo one or more mutually\n> indistinguishable awakenings and in which the number of awakenings she\n> will undergo is determined by the outcome of a random process. Let $S$\n> be a partition of alternative hypotheses concerning the outcome of\n> this process. Beauty knows the objective chance of each hypothesis in\n> $S$, and she also knows how many times she will awaken conditional on\n> each of these hypotheses, but she has no other relevant information.\n> The problem is to determine how her credence should be divided among\n> the hypotheses in $S$ when she first awakens. The original Sleeping\n> Beauty problem is the instance of this class of problems in which the\n> random process that determines how many times Beauty awakens is a fair\n> coin toss and in which Beauty awakens once given Heads and twice given\n> Tails. [@Ross2010 413-4]\n\nThe 'Generalised Thirder Principle' says\n\n> In any Sleeping Beauty problem, defined by a partition $S$, upon first\n> awakening, Beauty's credence in any given hypothesis in $S$ should be\n> proportional to the product of its objective chance and the number of\n> times Beauty awakens if this hypothesis is true. [@Ross2010 414]\n\nRoss shows that this Principle leads to violations of countable\nadditivity, and argues (convincingly to my mind) that this is a serious\nproblem for the Principle. In @Ross2010 he argues that many arguments\nfor the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer imply the Generalised Thirder\nPrinciple, and in @Ross2012 he argues that the same is true of the\nargument for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer in @Weatherson-SoSB. He\nsuggests that we have some inductive reason to think that *all*\narguments for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer will imply the Generalised\nThirder Principle. In reply I want to make three points.\n\nFirst, Ross offers a much more careful presentation and analysis of the\nargument for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer than appears in\n@Weatherson-SoSB, and that analysis does really suggest that the\nargument overgenerates. But second, the careful setting out suggests\nthat the argument fails by its own standards; it commits a fallacy of\nequivocation. So I don't think it's as much inductive evidence for\nRoss's general conclusion about all arguments for the\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ answer as he suggests. And third, the inductive\nconclusion Ross draws is not true. There are arguments for the\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ answer that don't imply the Generalised Thirder\nprinciple. Below I outline two ways to fix the argument in\n@Weatherson-SoSB so that it becomes such an argument.\n\nIt will be worthwhile having a minimal example of where the Generalised\nThirder principle goes beyond the arguments for the\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ answer, so consider the following minimal version.\n\n> **Three-Day Sleeping Beauty**\n>\n> A coin will be flipped. If it comes up Heads, Beauty will wake up\n> Monday, and go back to sleep until Thursday. If it comes up Tails,\n> Beauty will wake Monday, then have her memories of that waking erased,\n> then wake again Tuesday, and have her memories of that waking erased,\n> then wake up Wednesday, and go back to sleep until Thursday. The\n> different possible wakings will be indistinguishable.[^1] When she\n> wakes on Monday, what should her credence be that the coin landed\n> Heads?\n\nThe Generalised Thirder says that it should be $\\frac{1}{4}$. One of\nour aims here will be to come up with an argument for the\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ answer in the original puzzle that doesn't imply the\nanswer to the Three-Day Sleeping Beauty puzzle is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nReturning to the original puzzle, Let *Cr*$_1$ be Beauty's credence\nfunction when she wakes on Monday. Let $M$ be the proposition Beauty\nwould express on waking with \"Today is Monday\". And let $H$ be the\nproposition that the coin landed heads. The $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer\nentails that the following claims are all true.\n\n1.  *Cr*$_1$$(M \\wedge H)$ = *Cr*$_1$$(M \\wedge \\neg H)$\n\n2.  *Cr*$_1$$(\\neg M \\wedge \\neg H)$\n\n3.  *Cr*$_1$$(M \\wedge \\neg H)$ = *Cr*$_1$$(\\neg M \\wedge \\neg H)$\n\nThe usual argument for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer argues for\n(1) and\n(2)Cr, and then derives\n(3). And\nthe arguments for\n(2)\nCr typically generalise into arguments for the\nGeneralised Thirder Principle, and hence to violations of countable\nadditivity.\n\nTo get a bit better feel for what's going on with these principles,\nconsider one interesting sub-class of Ross's large category of Sleeping\nBeauty problems. These are problems where there are $n$ chance\nhypotheses, and for any $i$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, Beauty is woken\n$i$ times if chance hypothesis $h_i$ is true. When she wakes up, we can\nlet the proposition $p_{ji}$, where $1 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq n$, be the\nproposition that this is the $i$'th day, and chance hypothesis $h_j$ is\ntrue. The following table, where the chance hypotheses are on the rows,\nand days are on the columns, represents the possibilities as they strike\nBeauty.\n\n::: {.center}\n            Day 1      Day 2     $\\dots$   Day $n$\n  ------- ---------- ---------- --------- ----------\n    $h_1$  $p_{11}$                       \n    $h_2$  $p_{12}$   $p_{22}$            \n      ...                                 \n    $h_n$  $p_{1n}$   $p_{2n}$   $\\dots$   $p_{nn}$\n  ------- ---------- ---------- --------- ----------\n:::\n\nThe usual argument for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer to Sleeping Beauty\nincludes a 'vertical' argument and a 'horizontal' argument. The\n'vertical' argument attempts to show that\n$\\text{Cr}_1(p_{1i} | p_{11} \\vee \\dots \\vee p_{1n}) = Ch(h_i)$.\nThe 'horizontal' argument attempts to show that\n$\\text{Cr}_1(p_{ji} | p_{i1} \\vee \\dots \\vee p_{ii}) = \\frac{1}{i}$.\nOr, at least, it attempts to show that those claims are true for the\nspecial case where $n = 2$. but as Ross shows, the arguments offered\nseem to work in the $n = 2$ case iff they work in the general case. And\nthese vertical and horizontal arguments together do imply the\nGeneralised Thirder Principle.\n\nThe argument in @Weatherson-SoSB took a different tack. It argued for\n(1)\n and\n(3), and\nderived (2)\nCr. In terms of the table above, the idea was to\nreplace the 'horizontal' argument, and indeed to reject its conclusion\nin the general case, with a 'diagonal' argument, which showed that\n$\\text{Cr}_1(p_{ii} | p_{11} \\vee \\dots \\vee p_{nn}) = Ch(h_i)$.\nIf the vertical and diagonal arguments worked, and didn't\novergeneralise, then they wouldn't entail a solution for cases like\nThree-Day Sleeping Beauty, or about any case from the above class where\n$n > 2$.\n\nIf we drop the restriction to Sleeping Beauty problems where Beauty is\nwoken $i$ times if chance hypothesis $h_i$ is true, and return to Ross's\nmore general class, the arguments in @Weatherson-SoSB were meant to\nprove the following two claims, and not a lot more.\n\nFirst Day\n\n:   In any Sleeping Beauty problem where Beauty wakes at least one time\n    in every chance hypothesis, and exactly one time in at least one of\n    them, when she wakes the first time, her conditional credences in\n    each hypothesis in $S$, conditional on this actually being the first\n    waking, equals the objective chance of each such hypothesis.\n\nLast Day\n\n:   In any Sleeping Beauty problem where Beauty wakes at least one time\n    in every chance hypothesis,, when she wakes the first time, her\n    conditional credences in each hypothesis in $S$, conditional on this\n    actually being the last waking, equals the objective chance of each\n    such hypothesis.\n\nSince **First Day** entails\n(1)\n, and **Last Day** entails\n(3),\nthese principles entail the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer. But they don't\nsettle what to say about the Three-Day Sleeping Beauty example. If\n*Cr*$_3$ is Beauty's credences when she wakes for the first time in that\nexample, these principles are consistent with Beauty having the\nfollowing credal distribution. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Cr}_3(\\text{Today is Monday and Heads}) &= \\frac{1}{5} \\\\\n\\text{Cr}_3(\\text{Today is Monday and Tails}) &= \\frac{1}{5} \\\\\n\\text{Cr}_3(\\text{Today is Tuesday and Tails}) &= \\frac{2}{5} \\\\\n\\text{Cr}_3(\\text{Today is Wednesday and Tails}) &= \\frac{1}{5} \\end{aligned}$$\nBut those credences are incompatible with the Generalised Thirder\nPrinciple, so **First Day** and **Last Day** do not entail that\nprinciple.\n\n@Ross2012 argues that this isn't right, and that the motivation for\n**First Day** offered in @Weatherson-SoSB in fact does lead to the\nGeneralised Thirder Principle on its own. I think that's true in a\nsense; the argument provides just as much support for the Generalised\nThirder Principle as it does for **First Day**. But that's because it is\na bad argument, and doesn't support **First Day**. We'll see why that's\ntrue shortly. But since it is true, a new argument is needed for\n(1)\n, one that supports **First Day**, but not the\nGeneralised Thirder principle.\n\nMost discussions of Sleeping Beauty assume that the contents of\npropositional attitudes are sets of centered worlds. Following\n@Stalnaker2008, the argument in @Weatherson-SoSB tried to get by with\npropositions simply being sets of worlds. The key idea was that the\nworlds themselves would be fine-grained enough that thoughts like\n*Hesperus is Phosophorus*, or *Today is Monday* would be contingently\ntrue if true at all. Very roughly, we associate singular terms with\nsomething like Fregean senses.[^2] When Beauty wonders whether today is\nMonday, she isn't wondering about whether an instance of the law of\nidentity is true. She has no more interest in that law than does the\nfirst gentleman of Europe. She is wondering, in effect, whether two\nsenses, TODAY and MONDAY, have the same referent.\n\nThis way of looking at things implies that credal dynamics need to be\ncomplicated. Sometimes our credences change because we acquire more\ninformation, and we react accordingly. But sometimes our credences\nchange because we acquire new senses, and we can think new thoughts.\nThat will become crucial in what follows.\n\nThere is a quick argument for **Last Day**. Consider what happens after\nBeauty wakes up at the end of the puzzle, and is told that the game is\nover. (That is, on Wednesday in the original puzzle, or on Thursday in\nthe three-day variant.) Plausibly, her credence in $H$ should be back to\n$\\frac{1}{2}$, or at least it is hard to see a good argument why it\nshould be anything else.[^3] She can also think back to her last waking,\nand think to herself *If H, that was on Monday, and if $\\neg$H, that was\non Tuesday*. (She'll replace *Tuesday* with *Wednesday* in the three-day\nvariant.) Call this conditional $C$. Now think back to that last waking.\nAt that time she is wondering various thoughts about the waking she is\ncurrently undergoing, a waking she will describe as \"this waking\". When\nshe wakes on Wednesday, and thinks about \"that waking\", it is plausible\nshe is thinking the very same kind of Fregean thought. She is thinking\nabout the same thing, and thinking about it in the same kind of way. If\nthat's right, then the big difference between her credences after the\npuzzle ends and her credences on the last waking are just that she comes\nto learn $C$. So on the last waking, her credence in $H$ conditional on\n$C$ should be $\\frac{1}{2}$, since when she learns $C$ and nothing\nelse, her credence in $H$ becomes $\\frac{1}{2}$. And that entails\n(3), and\nsimilar reasoning generalises to all Sleeping Beauty problems to entail\n**Last Day**.[^4]\n\nThe argument in @Weatherson-SoSB for\n(1)\n, and for **First Day**, involved a rather\nbaroque variant of the example involving time travelers. And, as we've\nnoted already, it also involves some fallacious equivocation. Before we\nget to that, it is worth noting two other arguments for the same\nconclusion, neither of which generalise to the Generalised Thirder\nPrinciple. Both arguments have contentious premises, but they are\nsomewhat independent, so I hope that presenting both arguments will\nincrease the number of people who agree with **FirstDay**.\n\nThe first argument is an argument from the Principal Principle. Consider\nthe version of the Sleeping Beauty puzzle where the coin is tossed after\nBeauty goes back to sleep on Monday. (We didn't say so far when the coin\nis tossed, and it was consistent with everything we said that it is\nMonday night.) And assume that Beauty knows that the coin is tossed\nMonday. So when she wakes on Monday, she knows that the chance of $H$ is\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ if it is Monday. That is,\n$\\text{Cr}_1(Ch(H) = \\frac{1}{2} | M) = 1$. The Principal\nPrinciple says that unless Beauty has inadmissible evidence,\n$\\text{Cr}_1(H | Cr(H) = \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nAnd plausibly she doesn't have any inadmissible evidence conditional on\nit being Monday. Putting these two together, we get\n$\\text{Cr}_1(H | M) = \\frac{1}{2}$. And that kind of\nreasoning generalises to support **First Day**.\n\nThe argument here is similar to the original argument given for\n(1)\n in @Elga2000. Elga imagines a variant of the\nexample where Beauty is told, sometime after she wakes up, that it is\nMonday, and argues that after that she should have credence\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ in $H$, and derives\n(1)\n from that. @Halpern2004 objects to this\nargument on the grounds that the possibility of Beauty being told what\nday it is undermines the indistinguishability of the wakings, and this\nundermines Elga's own argument for\n(2)\nCr. I'm not sure Halpern is right, but in any\ncase, this argument doesn't rely on any possibility of Beauty being told\nwhat day it is. I imagine that some people will object to the claim that\nBeauty has no inadmissible evidence. But it is hard to see what she\nknows which is inadmissible, at least conditional on it being Monday.\nShe *knows* that if it is Monday, the truth of $H$ rests on a chance\nevent that is yet to take place, and from which she is causally\nisolated. That looks to me like knowledge that she has no inadmissible\nevidence.\n\nThe second argument is a version of the the Technicolor Beauty argument\nin @Titlebaum2008. It relies on a variant of the example that drops the\nidea that the wakings are indistinguishable in a strong sense. I'll set\nup first what the idea behind the argument is, and then set out how it\nworks. Assume that Beauty can think about $M$ on Sunday. Follow Ross in\nusing *Cr*$_0$ for Beauty's credences on Sunday. The same Principal\nPrinciple style argument we used above suggests that\n$\\text{Cr}_0(H | M) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Indeed in this case the\nargument is even stronger, since everyone agrees that on Sunday, Beauty\nhas no inadmissible evidence. But nothing happens to surprise Beauty\nbetween Sunday and Monday, so\n$\\text{Cr}_1(H | M) = \\frac{1}{2}$ should be\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ as well, and we derive\n(1)\n from there.\n\nThere are a few problems with this argument. For one thing, the 'no\nsurprise' premise goes by very quickly. More importantly, Beauty can't\nactually have $M$ thoughts on Sunday. She can think to herself that\nMonday is Monday, or at least she could if she cared to think about the\nlaw of identity. But that's not the same thought as $M$. Remember, the\nguiding idea here is that contents are Fregean; it isn't easy to have\nthe same thought as someone who thinks *This is Monday*. Something\ndramatic needs to happen to let Beauty have such a thought on Sunday,\nwhen she isn't in a position to make the same kind of demonstration as\nshe is on Monday.\n\nHere's one way the dramatic thing might happen. Change the example so\nthat the wakings Beauty undergoes are not *phenomenally*\nindistinguishable. In fact, Beauty is told on Sunday that each waking\nwill be in a brightly coloured room, and the colours will be different\neach day. As it happens, the room that will be used for Monday is red,\nthough Beauty doesn't know that. Let $RE$ be the proposition that one of\nBeauty's wakings will be in a red room, and $RM$ be the proposition that\nshe wakes Monday in a red room. Now clearly $RE$, on its own, is\ninadmissible evidence in the sense that *Cr*$_0$$(H | RE)$ need not be\n$\\frac{1}{2}$. After all, $RE$ is probabilistic evidence that Beauty\nhas more than one waking, since the more wakings she has, the more\nchance there is that one of them will be in a red room. On the other\nhand, $RM$ does not look like inadmissible evidence. She has to wake up\nin some colour room or other on Monday; learning it is red doesn't\nchange anything. So *Cr*$_0$$(H | RM)$ should be $\\frac{1}{2}$. And\nthat's true even though $RM$ obviously entails $RE$.\n\nNow she wakes on Monday, and the room is red. What follows? Well, she\nnow knows $RE$. And she can identify her current waking with the red\nwaking she imagined (or at least could have imagined) on Sunday. So it\nis at least arguable that when on Monday she considers the thought *This\nwaking is on Monday*, that's the very same thought she considers on\nSunday by saying to herself *The waking in a red room is on Monday*.\nMaking that last claim more plausible would require offering a more\ndetailed theory of mental content than I have the space (or ability) to\ndo here. For now I'm just going to take as a premise that there's a\nworkable theory of mental content that types contents more finely than\ndoes a purely referential theory, but on which it is nevertheless the\ncase that Beauty's demonstrative thought on Monday has the same content\nas her descriptive thought (about the waking in the red room) does on\nSunday.\n\nHere is one way of thinking about that claim about content that may make\nit more plausible. (This idea is derived from the arguments in\n@Jeshion2002.) Imagine that on Sunday Beauty names the waking in a red\nroom. She calls it 'Bluey'. She knows that 'Bluey' might not refer. That\nis, she knows that Bluey, like Vulcan and Sherlock Holmes, might not\nexist. But she nevertheless entertains detailed thoughts about Bluey.\nShe wonders if Bluey will be on Monday, whether she'll be happy when\nBluey happens, and so on. Now she wakes up on Monday, and sees the red\nwalls. She says to herself, \"This is Bluey\". From that point on, it\nseems that she'd express the same thought with *This waking is\n$\\varphi$* and *Bluey is $\\varphi$*, and it seems she's express the same\nthought with *Bluey is $\\varphi$* and *The waking in a red room is\n$\\varphi$.* By appeal to transitivity of identity, and substituting a\nparticular value for $\\varphi$, we get that she expresses the same\nthought by saying *This waking is on Monday* as by saying *The waking in\na red room is on Monday*.\n\nIf that claim about content is right, then *all* that happens on Monday\nis that Beauty learns that $RE$ is true. She doesn't acquire the ability\nto think new thoughts, or to make fresh divisions in possibility space,\nthe way that she does in the standard version of the puzzle. In the\nstandard version of the puzzle, the demonstrative thought she considers\non Monday, the one she would express by saying *This is Monday*, is not\nequivalent to anything she can think on Sunday. So when she wakes, she\nnot only acquires some evidence, she acquires a new cognitive capacity.\nThat doesn't happen here, which makes the calculations easier.\n\nIn particular, it lets us appeal to the following key fact. If $E_2$\nentails $E_1$, and a particular update only involves conditionalising\none's prior credences, then learning $E_1$ doesn't change the\nconditional credence of anything given $E_2$. That's a consequence of\nthe following theorem. Let $\\Pr$ be any probability function, and let\n$\\Pr^+$ be the result of conditionalising that function on $E_1$. Then\n$\\Pr(H | E_2) = \\Pr^+(H | E_2)$. So if Beauty only learns $RE$, that\ndoesn't change the conditional credence of anything given $RM$. In\nparticular, it doesn't change the conditional credence of $H$ given\n$RM$. So *Cr*$_1$$(H | RM)$ = $\\frac{1}{2}$. And since $M$ and $RM$\nare trivially equivalent, since Beauty can see the room is red, it\nfollows that *Cr*$_1$$(H | M)$ = $\\frac{1}{2}$, as required.\n\nI suspect the main objection to this argument will be that adding the\nroom colours makes a substantial change to the problem. The fact that\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ is the correct answer in this technicolour version of\nSleeping Beauty, says the objector, is no reason to think that it is\nalso the correct answer in the version where the wakings are\nphenomenally indistinguishable. But I think the objector will have a\nhard time making the case that phenomenal indistinguishability is\nepistemically significant unless they want to defend what\n@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 calls the 'phenomenal conception of evidence'.\nAs has been pointed out in prior work on Sleeping Beauty, the different\nwakings are not evidentially equivalent; when she wakes up and sees that\n*this* waking is happening, that's a piece of evidence she gets in some\nbut not all wakings. (This point is made in @Weintraub2004 and\n@Stalnaker2008.) It might well be argued that this demonstrative\nevidence is in a sense symmetric; although she gets evidence that is\ndifferent in some sense on the different wakings, the force of that\nevidence is the same. But that's still true in the technicolour version\nof the problem as well. So I think, contra the objector, that this is a\ngood argument for\n(1)\n.\n\nBut neither of those were the argument offered in @Weatherson-SoSB. That\nargument involved a rather baroque modification to the puzzle. A time\ntraveller films Beauty waking on Monday and travels back to Sunday to\nshow Beauty the film. After she sees the film, and can think about the\nwaking it depicts, the traveller tells her that he took it on Monday. He\nthen wipes Beauty's memories of this telling, but not of the showing of\nthe film. The argument then proceeds as follows.\n\n1.  On Sunday, she can think about her Monday waking in the same way as\n    she thinks about it on Monday when she wakes, thanks to the time\n    traveller's film.\n\n2.  On Sunday, the rational credence in $H$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n3.  If premise 1 is true, then on Monday, after she wakes, the only\n    difference between her epistemic state then and her epistemic state\n    after being told that the film was of Monday is that she no longer\n    knows $M$.\n\n4.  If the only difference between two epistemic states is that in the\n    first, an agent knows $M$ and in the second she does not, then the\n    rational credence of $H$ given $M$ in the second state equals the\n    rational credence of $H$ in the first state.\n\nAnd from that $\\text{Cr}_1(H | M) =$$\\frac{1}{2}$ was\nclaimed to follow. Now there wasn't much of an argument for the first\npremise offered, and it might well be thought objectionable. It\ncertainly relies on a liberal conception of sameness of 'ways of\nthinking'. But let's set that aside, because there is a much bigger\nproblem with the argument. It hopelessly equivocates on the phrase 'On\nSunday'. Let's distinguish the following four times that are all on\nSunday.\n\n-   $t_1$ is before the time traveller turns up.\n\n-   $t_2$ is immediately after the time traveller shows Beauty the film.\n\n-   $t_3$ is immediately after the time traveller tells Beauty that the\n    film is of Monday.\n\n-   $t_4$ is after the time traveller wipes Beauty's memories of that\n    telling, but not of the showing of the film.\n\nNow let's consider the first two premises in Weatherson's argument. The\nfirst premise is clearly false if 'On Sunday' refers to $t_1$, but\narguably true if it refers to $t_2, t_3$ or $t_4$. The second premise is\nclearly true if 'On Sunday' refers to $t_1$, but much less plausible if\nit refers to any later time. If it refers to $t_2$ or $t_4$, it is\narguably equivalent to the $\\frac{1}{2}$ answer to the original\nSleeping Beauty problem, which makes it pretty useless in an argument\nfor the $\\frac{1}{3}$ answer! If it refers to $t_3$, it is much too\nclose to what we're trying to prove in arguing for **FirstDay**, so it\nis still argumentatively useless.\n\nRoss argues that the style of argument we've been considering would, if\nit showed that (1)\n, and indeed more generally supported **First\nDay**, would show much more. In fact, it would show that for any two\nchance hypotheses $h_i$ and $h_j$, and any $k$ such that $h_j$ is\nconsistent with at least $k$ wakings, that the following is true. (I'll\nagain use $p_{kj}$ to mean that this is the $k$'th waking and $h_j$ is\ntrue.)\n\n$$\\text{Cr}_1(p_{1i} | (p_{1i} \\vee p_{kj})) = \\frac{Ch(h_i)}{Ch(h_i) + Ch(h_j)}$$\n\nAnd from that we can derive the Generalised Thirder Principle, and hence\ncountable additivity violations. That wasn't what was intended; the\nargument was only designed to work for the special case where $k = 1$,\ni.e., **First Day**. Now I think Ross is right in the following sense;\nthere's just as good an argument in @Weatherson-SoSB for the above\nequation as there is for **First Day**. But that argument is no good for\nthe reasons described above. Let's see where the same equivocation comes\ninto Ross's telling of the story. I've changed Ross's notation a fair\nbit into notation I find easier to work with. Hopefully I haven't lost\nanything in the process. I'm also going to focus on the special case of\nThree-Day Sleeping Beauty, where $h_1$ is the coin lands heads and $h_2$\nis the coin lands tails, and on the case where $k = 2$. So what we're\nreally going to look at is whether there's an argument in Three-Day\nSleeping Beauty for this equation.\n\n$$\\text{Cr}_3(p_{11} | (p_{11} \\vee p_{22})) = \\frac{Ch(h_1)}{Ch(h_1) + Ch(h_2)} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow as noted above, I think that this equation need not hold in\nThree-Day Sleeping Beauty; in the model I gave for it earlier,\n$\\text{Cr}_3(p_{11}) = \\frac{1}{5}$, and\n$\\text{Cr}_3(p_{22}) = \\frac{2}{5}$, so\n$\\text{Cr}_3(p_{11} | (p_{11} \\vee p_{22})) =$\n$\\frac{1}{3}$. But let's see how Ross derives the\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ answer.\n\nAgain there is a time-traveller who shows Beauty a film. But this isn't\nnecessarily a film of the first waking; the time traveller films the\nfirst waking if $h_1$, and the second waking if $h_2$. After seeing the\nfilm, Beauty is told this. So on Sunday, says Ross, Beauty's credences\nshould satisfy these constraints. (I'm following Ross in using *Cr*$_0$\nfor the Sunday credences.) $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Cr}_0(h_1) &= \\text{Cr}_0(h_1 \\wedge p_{11}) \\\\\n\\text{Cr}_0(h_1) &= Ch(h_1)\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThere are other premises used, but these will be the crucial ones.\nThey're crucial because there's no good reason to think that there's\n*any* time Sunday when Beauty's credences should satisfy both these\nequations. Before she sees the film, she can't even think about\npropositions like $p_{11}$, since she can't have singular thoughts about\nthe waking it depicts. After she sees the film, there is no reason to\nthink that her credences should align with chances. Causal contact with\na time traveller who brings information that may well be about a time\nafter the chance event, evidence whose existence may depend on the\noutcome of the chance event, is pretty much paradigmatically\ninadmissible evidence for the purposes of the Principal Principle. So\nafter the film, there is no reason to think\n$\\text{Cr}_0(h_1) = Ch(h_1)$.\n\nI should stress that Ross doesn't *endorse* the equivocating premises\nhere; he merely attributes them to @Weatherson-SoSB, and fairly so. But\nI think once we see the equivocation we can see there is no fear the\nkind of argument used in @Weatherson-SoSB will lead to the Generalised\nThirder Principle. That argument is too flawed to lead to anything. But\nthere are plenty of other arguments for **First Day**, such as the two\narguments offered here. And both of those arguments rely on distinctive\nfeatures of the first day. Most notably, they rely on the fact that for\nall we say in the setup of the problem, the first waking is before the\nchance event. So there's no reason to think they will have the\nproblematic consequences that Ross finds in the argument for **First\nDay** in @Weatherson-SoSB.\n\n[^1]: I have some concerns about what 'indistinguishable' means in this\n    context. We'll come back to that issue a lot in what follows.\n\n[^2]: In @Weatherson-SoSB these are described as haeceitties, but this\n    is misleading at best. It is crucial that 'Hesperus' and\n    'Phosphorus' have different associations, but intuitively they have\n    the same haecceity. Thinking of the associations as being with\n    something like senses is better.\n\n[^3]: One might be tempted by a seemingly stronger argument. For\n    instance, one could argue that on Wednesday, Beauty knows that the\n    chance of $H$ was $\\frac{1}{2}$, and she has no inadmissible\n    evidence, so by the Principal Principle her credence in $H$ should\n    be $\\frac{1}{2}$. But it isn't clear that she has no\n    inadmissible evidence; perhaps the evidence she would express by\n    thinking back to her last waking and saying *That waking happened*\n    is inadmissible. Or one might be tempted by a Reflection Principle\n    based argument against any alternative credence. But such arguments\n    seem to lead to odd results in general around Sleeping Beauty. It's\n    best, I think, to stick with the clear intuition that on Wednesday\n    her credence in $H$ should be $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n[^4]: Strictly speaking, all we've really shown is that Beauty's\n    credences on the last day she wakes should satisfy **Last Day**. So\n    if the focus of the puzzle is on her credences on the first day, all\n    we've strictly speaking shown is that if $H$, then **Last Day** is\n    true. I think it is plausible that **Last Day** should be\n    independent of how the coin lands, but I admit that I don't have an\n    argument against someone who wants to dispute this.\n\n\n\n",
