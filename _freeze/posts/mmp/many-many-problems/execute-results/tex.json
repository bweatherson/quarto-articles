Stephen Schiffer has argued that the theory cannot account for reports of speech involving vague singular terms. Vann McGee and Brian McLaughlin say that theory cannot, yet, account for vague singular beliefs. Neil McKinnon has argued that we cannot provide a plausible theory of when precisifications are acceptable, which the supervaluational theory needs. And Roy Sorensen argues that supervaluationism is inconsistent with a directly referential theory of names. McGee and McLaughlin see the problem they raise as a cause for further research, but the other authors all take the problems they raise to provide sufficient reasons to jettison supervaluationism. I will argue that none of these problems provide such a reason, though the arguments are valuable critiques. In many cases, we must make some adjustments to the supervaluational theory to meet the posed challenges. The goal of this paper is to make those adjustments, and meet the challenges.\ndate: August 29 2003\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1111/1467-9213.00327\"\ncategories:\n  - language\n  - logic\n  - vagueness\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9213.00327\njournal:\n    title: \"Philosophical Quarterly\"\n    publisher: \"Wiley\"\nvolume: 53\nnumber: 213\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: kilimanjaro.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\n### Schiffer's Problem\n\nStephen Schiffer suggests the following argument refutes\nsupervaluationism. The central point is that, allegedly, the\nsupervaluational theory of vague singular terms says false things about\nsingular terms in speech reports.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophical Quarterly_ 55: 481-501.\n\nPhoto by [Yoni Lerner](https://www.flickr.com/photos/25570425@N07) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/39a2c491-c2e6-4454-92e8-cb45e7499d30).\n</aside>\n\n> Pointing in a certain direction, Alice says to Bob, 'There is where\n> Harold and I first danced the rumba.' Later that day, while pointing\n> in the same direction, Bob says to Carla, 'There is where Alice said\n> she and Harold first danced the rumba.' Now consider the following\n> argument:\n>\n> Bob's utterance was true.\n>\n> If the supervaluational semantics were correct, Bob's utterance\n> wouldn't be true.\n>\n> $\\therefore$ The supervaluational semantics isn't correct.\n> [@Schiffer2000b 321]\n\nAssuming Bob did point in pretty much the same direction as Alice, it\nseems implausible to deny (1). The argument is valid. So the issue is\nwhether (2) is correct. Schiffer has a quick argument for (2), which I\nwill paraphrase here. On supervaluational semantics, a sentence is true\niff each of its acceptable precisifications is true. In this case, this\nmeans that if Bob's utterance is true then it must be true however we\nprecisify 'there'. Each precisification of 'there' will be a (precise)\nplace, and since 'there' is rather vague, many of these precisifications\nwill be acceptable. For Bob's utterance to be true, then, Alice must\nhave said of every one of those places that it was the place where\nHarold and her first danced the rumba. But Alice couldn't have said all\nthose things, so (2) is true.\n\nSchiffer suggests that one way out of this problem would be to accept\nthe existence of a vague object: the place where Harold and Alice first\ndanced the rumba. I will note in section four several reasons for\nthinking the cost of this move is excessive. Fortunately, there is a\ncheaper way home.\n\nSchiffer underestimates the scope of supervaluationism. On Schiffer's\nvision of the theory, a precisification assigns a precise content to a\nword, and hence to a sentence, then the world determines whether that\ncontent is satisfied, and hence whether the sentence is true on that\nprecisification. This is hardly an unorthodox view of how\nsupervaluationism works, it seems for instance to be exactly the view\ndefended in @Keefe2000, but it is neither the only way, nor the best\nway, forward. We could say, rather, that a precisification assigns\ncontent to *every linguistic token in the world*, and the truth\nconditions of every one of these tokens is then determined relative to\nthat global assignment of content. So if a precisification *P* assigns a\nplace *x* to Bob's word 'there', Bob's utterance is true according to\nthat precisification iff *P* also assigns *x* to Alice's utterance of\n'there'. That is, Bob's utterance is true according to *P* iff the\nprecisification of his words by *P* just is what Alice said *according\nto P*.[^1]\n\nIt is a dramatic widening of the scope of precisifications to claim that\nthey assign content to every linguistic token in the world, rather than\njust words in the sentence under consideration, but it can be\njustified.[^2] Consider how we would react if later in the day, pointing\nin the crucial direction, Alice said, 'Harold and I never danced the\nrumba there.' We would think that Alice had contradicted herself -- that\nbetween her two statements she must have said something false. A\nstandard supervaluationist account, where sentences are precisified one\nat a time, cannot deliver this result. On such a view, it might be that\neach of Alice's utterances are true on some precisifications, so they\nare both neither true nor false. On my theory, each precisification\napplies to both of Alice's utterances (as well as every other utterance\never made) and since on each precisification one or other of the\nutterances is false, it turns out supertrue that Alice said something\nfalse, as desired. The current view allows for penumbral connections\nbetween sentences, as well as penumbral connections within sentences.\nJust as someone who says, \"That is red and orange\" says something false,\nmy theory decrees that someone who says, \"That is red. That is orange,\"\nwhile pointing at the same thing says something false, even if the\nobject is in the vague area 'between' red and orange.\n\nIt is crucial for this response to work that on every precisification,\nAlice and Bob's demonstratives are co--referential. It does not seem\nlike a particular expansion of supervaluational theory to posit this as\na penumbral connection between the two words. At least, it seems\nplausible enough to do this if Alice and Bob really are pointing in a\nsimilar direction. If their demonstrations are only *roughly*\nco-directional, then on some precisifications they may well pick out\ndifferent objects. This will definitely happen if some admissible\nprecisification of Alice's 'there' is not an admissible precisification\nof Bob's 'there'. In such a case, the theory here predicts that Bob's\nutterance will be indeterminate in truth value. But if Alice and Bob\nonly vaguely pointed in the same direction this is the correct\nprediction.\n\n### Natural Properties\n\nSchiffer's problem seems to have been solved with a minimum of fuss, but\nthere is still a little work to do. Above I posited a penumbral\nconnection between Alice's and Bob's words without *explaining* how such\na connection could arise. This connection can be explained by some\ngeneral considerations about content, considerations closely tied to the\nview of vagueness as semantic indecision that provides the best\nmotivation for supervaluationism. As a few writers have pointed out\n[@Quine1960; @Putnam1980; @Kripke1982], there is not enough in our\ndispositions to use words to fix a precise content all terms in our\nlexicon. This does not immediately imply a thorough-going content\nscepticism because, as a few writers have also pointed out\n[@Putnam1973; @Kripke1980; @Lewis1983e; @Lewis1984a], meanings ain't\n(entirely) in the head. Sometimes our words refer to a particular\nproperty or object rather than another not because our dispositions make\nthis so, but because of some particular feature of that property or\nobject. David Lewis calls this extra feature 'naturalness': some\nproperties and objects are more natural than others, and when our verbal\ndispositions do not discriminate between different possible contents,\nnaturalness steps in to finish the job and the more natural property or\nobject gets to be the content.\n\nWell, that's what happens when things go well. Vagueness happens when\nthings don't go well. Sometimes our verbal dispositions are\nindiscriminate between several different contents, and no one of these\nis more natural than all the rest. In these cases there will be many\nunnatural contents not eliminated by our dispositions that naturalness\ndoes manage to eliminate, but there will be still be many contents left\nuneliminated. Consider, for example, all the possible properties we\n*might* denote by 'tall woman'. As far as our usage dispositions go, it\nmight denote any one of the following properties: woman taller than\n1680mm, woman taller than 1681mm, woman taller than 1680.719mm, *etc*.\nAnd it does not seem that any of these properties are more natural than\nany other. Hence there is no precise fact about what the phrase denotes.\nHence it is vague. In sum, our dispositions are never enough to settle\nthe content of a term. In some cases, such as 'water', 'rabbit', 'plus',\n'brain' and 'vat', nature is kind enough to, more or less, finish the\njob. In others it is not, and vagueness is the result.\n\n(The above reasoning has a surprising consequence. Perhaps our verbal\ndispositions are consistent with the predicate *Tall X* denoting the\nproperty of being in the top quartile of *X*s by height. Unlike each of\nthe properties mentioned in the text, this is a more natural property\nthan many of its competitors. So if this kind of approach to vagueness\nis right, there *might* not be quite as much vagueness as we expected.)\n\nIf this is how vagueness is created, then there is a natural way to\nunderstand how precisifications remove vagueness. Vagueness arises\nbecause *more natural than* is a partial order on putative contents, and\nhence there might be no most natural content consistent with our verbal\ndispositions. If this relation only defined a strict ordering, so\nwhatever the candidate meanings were, one of them would be most natural,\nvagueness might be defeated. Well, that isn't true in reality, but it is\ntrue on each precisification. Every precisification is a completion of\nthe 'naturalness' partial order. That is, each precisification *P*\ndefines a strict order, *more natural-P than*, on possible contents of\nterms such that *o*~1~ is more natural-*P* than *o*~2~ if (but not only\nif) *o*~1~ is more natural than *o*~2~. The particular contents of terms\naccording to *P* is then defined by using the more natural-*P* than\nrelation where the more natural than relation is used in the real theory\nof content.\n\nThis conjecture meshes nicely with my theory of the role of\nprecisifications. First, it explains why precisifications apply to the\nwhole of language. Since a precisification does not just remedy a defect\nin a particular word, but a defect in the content generation mechanism,\nprecisifications are most naturally applied not just to a single word,\nbut to every contentful entity. Secondly, it explains why we have the\nparticular penumbral connections we actually have. Recall that it was\nleft a little unexplained above why Alice's and Bob's use of 'there'\ndenoted the same precise place. On the current conjecture, Alice's term\nrefers to a particular place *x* according to *P* because *x* is more\nnatural--*P* than all the other places to which Alice might have\nreferred. If this is so, then *x* will be more natural--*P* than all the\nother places to which Bob might have referred, so it will also be the\nreferent according to *P* of Bob's there. Hence according to every\nprecisification, Bob's utterance will be true, as Schiffer required.\n\nWe can also explain some other unexplained penumbral connections by\nappeal to naturalness. Consider the sentence *David Chalmers is\nconscious*. Unless this is supertrue, supervaluationism is in trouble.\nIt is vague just which object is denoted by *David Chalmers*. On every\nprecisification, there are other objects that massively overlap David\nChalmers. Indeed, these very objects are denoted by 'David Chalmers' on\nother precisifications. These objects are not conscious, since if one\ndid there would be two conscious objects where, intuitively, there is\njust one. But each of these rogue objects must be in the extension of\n'conscious' on the precisifications where it is the denotation of 'David\nChalmers'. So 'conscious' must be vague in slightly unexpected ways, and\nthere must be a penumbral connection between it and 'David Chalmers': on\nevery precisification, whatever object is denoted by that name is in the\nextension of 'conscious', while no other potential denotata of 'David\nChalmers' is in the extension. How is this penumbral connection to be\nexplained? Not by appeal to the meanings of the terms! Even if 'David\nChalmers' has descriptive content, it is highly implausible that this\nincludes *being conscious*. (After all, unless medicine improves a bit\nin a thousand years Chalmers will not be conscious.) Rather, this\npenumbral connection is explained by the fact that the very same thing,\nnaturalness, is used in resolving the vagueness in the terms 'conscious'\nand 'David Chalmers'. If the precisification makes one particular\npossible precisification of 'David Chalmers', say *d*~1~, more natural\nthan another, *d*~2~, then it will make properties satisfied by *d*~1­~\nmore natural than those satisfied by *d*~2~, so every precisification\nwill make the denotation of 'David Chalmers' fall into the extension of\n'conscious'.\n\nWe can say the same thing about Alice's original statement: *That is\nwhere Harold and I first danced the rumba.* Since one can't *first*\ndance the rumba with Harold in two different places, it seems Alice's\nstatement can't be true relative to more than one precisification of\n'That'. But really the phrase after 'is' is also vague, and there is a\npenumbral connection (via naturalness) between it and the demonstrative.\nHence we can say Alice's statement is supertrue without appealing to any\n*mysterious* penumbral connections.\n\n### McGee and McLaughlin's Challenge\n\nVann McGee and Brian McLaughlin [-@McGee2000] raise a challenge for\nsupervlauational approaches to the Problem of the Many that uses belief\nreports in much the way that Schiffer's problem uses speech reports.\nThey fear that without further development, the supervaluational theory\ncannot distinguish between the *de re* and *de dicto* readings of (4).\n\n1.  Ralph believes that there is a snow-capped mountain within sight of\n    the equator.\n\nThey claim, correctly, that (4) should have both a *de dicto* reading\nand a *de re* reading, where in the latter case it is a belief about\nKilimanjaro. The problem with the latter case is unclear how Ralph's\nbelief can be about Kilimanjaro itself. To press the point, they\nconsider an atom at or around the base of Kilimanjaro, called Sparky,\nand define \"Kilimanjaro(+) to be the body of land constituted ... by the\natoms that make up Kilimanjaro together with Sparky [and]\nKilimanjaro(-) [to] be the body of land constituted ... by the atoms\nthat make up Kilimanjaro other than Sparky.\" (129) The problem with\ntaking (4) to be true on a *de re* reading is that \"there isn't\nanything, either in his mental state or in his neural state or in his\ncausal relations with his environment that would make one of\nKilimanjaro(+) and Kilimanjaro(-), rather than the other, the thing that\nRalph's belief is about.\" (146) So if the truth of (4) on a *de re*\nreading requires that Ralph believes a singular, or object-dependent,\nproposition, about one of Kilimanjaro(+) and Kilimanjaro(-), then (4)\ncannot be true. Even worse, if the truth of (4) requires that Ralph both\nthat Ralph believes a singular proposition about Kilimanjaro(+), that it\nis a snow-capped mountain within sight of the equator, and the same\nproposition about Kilimanjaro(-), then given some knowledge about\nmountains on Ralph's part, (4) cannot be true, because that would\nrequire Ralph to mistakenly believe there are two mountains located\nroughly where Kilimanjaro is located.\n\nWe should not be so easily dissuaded. It is hard to identify exactly\nwhich features of Ralph's \"mental state or neural state or causal\nrelations with his environment\" that make it the case that he believes\nthat two plus two equals four, but does not believe that two quus two\nequals four. (I assume Ralph is no philosopher, so lacks the concept\nQUUS.) I doubt, for example, that the concept PLUS has some causal\ninfluence over Ralph that the concept QUUS lacks. But Ralph does have\nthe belief involving PLUS, and not the belief involving QUUS. He has\nthis belief not merely in virtue of his mental or neural states, or his\ncausal interactions with his environment, but in virtue of the fact that\nPLUS is a more natural concept than QUUS, and hence is more eligible to\nbe a constituent of his belief.\n\nSo if Kilimanjaro(+) is more natural than Kilimanjaro(-), it will be a\nconstituent of Ralph's belief, despite the fact that there is no other\nreason to say his belief is about one rather than the other. Now, in\nreality Kilimanjaro(+) is no more natural than Kilimanjaro(-). But\naccording to any precisification, one of them will be more natural than\nthe other, for precisifications determine content by determining\nrelative naturalness. Hence if Ralph has a belief with the right\nstructure, in particular a belief with a place for an object (roughly,\nKilimanjaro) and the property *being within sight of the equator*, then\non every precisification he has a singular belief that a\nKilimanjaro-like mountain is within sight of the equator. And notice\nthat since naturalness determines both mental content and verbal\ncontent, on every precisification the constituent of that belief will be\nthe referent of 'Kilimanjaro'. So even on a *de re* reading, (4) will be\ntrue.\n\nSchiffer's problem showed that we should not take precisifications to be\ndefined merely over single sentences. McGee and McLaughlin's problem\nshows that we should take precisifications to set the content not just\nof sentences, but of mental states as well. Precisifications do not just\nassign precise content to every contentful linguistic token, but to\nevery contentful entity in the world, including beliefs. This makes the\nissue of penumbral connections that we discussed in section two rather\npressing. We already noted the need to establish penumbral connections\nbetween separate uses of demonstratives. Now we must establish penumbral\nconnections between words and beliefs. The idea that precisifications\ndetermine content by determining relative naturalness establishes these\nconnections.\n\nTo sum up, McGee and McLaughlin raise three related problems concerning\n*de re* belief. Two of these concern belief reports. First, how can we\ndistinguish between *de re* and *de dicto* reports? If I am right, we\ncan distinguish between these just the way Russell suggested, by\nspecifying the scope of the quantifiers. McGee and McLaughlin suspect\nthis will not work because in general we cannot argue from (5) to (6),\ngiven the vagueness of 'Kilimanjaro'.\n\n1.  Kilimanjaro is such that Ralph believes it to be within sight of the\n    equator.\n\n2.  There is a mountain such that Ralph believes it to be within sight\n    of the equator.\n\nWhether or not we want to accept a semantics in which we must restrict\nexistential generalisation in this way as a general rule, we can give an\nindependent argument that (6) is true whenever (4) is true on a *de re*\nreading (i.e. whenever (5) is true). The argument is just that on every\nprecisification, the subject of Ralph's salient singular belief is a\nmountain, so (6) is true on every precisification. This argument assumes\nthat there is a penumbral connection between the subject of this belief,\nas we might say the referent of 'Kilimanjaro' in his language of\nthought[^3], and the word 'mountain'. But since we have already\nestablished that there is such a connection between 'Kilimanjaro' in his\nlanguage of thought and 'Kilimanjaro' in public language, and there is\nobviously a connection between 'Kilimanjaro' in public language and the\nword 'mountain', as 'Kilimanjaro is a mountain' is supertrue, this\nassumption is safe. So the second puzzle McGee and McLaughlin raise, how\nit can be that the relevant *de re* reports can be *true*, has also been\naddressed.\n\nThere is a third puzzle McGee and McLaughlin raise that the reader might\nthink I have not addressed. How can it be that Ralph can actually have a\n*de re* belief concerning Kilimanjaro? I have so far concentrated on\nbelief reports, not merely on beliefs, and my theory has relied\ncrucially on correlations between the vagueness in these reports and the\nvagueness in the underlying belief. It might be thought that I have\nexcluded the most interesting case, the one where Ralph has a particular\nbelief with Kilimanjaro itself as a constituent. While I will end up\ndenying Ralph can have such a belief, I doubt this a problematic feature\nof my view. The theory outlined here denies that Ralph has\nobject--dependent beliefs, but not that he has *de re* beliefs. I deny\nthat Ralph has a belief that has Kilimanjaro(+) as a constituent, but it\nis hard to see how Ralph *could* have such a belief, since it very hard\nto see how he could have had a belief that has Kilimanjaro(+) rather\nthan Kilimanjaro(-) as its subject. (This was McGee and McLaughlin's\nfundamental point.) If we think that having a *de re* belief implies\nhaving a belief whose content is an object--dependent proposition, then\nwe must deny that there are *de re* beliefs about Kilimanjaro. Since\nthere is no object that is determinately a constituent of the\nproposition Ralph believes, it is a little hard to maintain that he\nbelieves an object--dependent proposition.[^4] But this is not the only\nway to make sense of *de re* beliefs.\n\nRobin Jeshion has argued that whether a belief is *de re* depends\nessentially on its role in cognition. \"What distinguishes *de re*\nthought is its structural or organisational role in thought\"\n[@Jeshion2002 67][^5] I won't rehearse Jeshion's arguments here, just\ntheir more interesting conclusions. We can have *de re* beliefs about an\nobject iff we have a certain kind of mental file folder for the object.\nThis folder need not be generated by acquaintance with the object, so\nacquiantanceless *de re* belief is possible. Indeed, the folder could\nhave been created defectively, so there is no object that the\ninformation in the folder is about.[^6] In this case, the contents of\nthe folder are subjectless *de re* beliefs. Jeshion doesn't discuss\nthis, but presumably the folder must not have been created purely to be\nthe repository for information about the bearer of a certain property,\nwhoever or whatever that is. We have to rule out this option if we\nfollow @Szabo2000 in thinking the folder metaphor plays a crucial role\nin explaining our talk and thought involving descriptions. Provided the\nfolder was created with the intent that it record information about some\nobject, rather than merely information about whatever object has a\nparticular property, its contents are *de re* beliefs. (To allow for\ndistinct folders 'about' non-existent objects, we must allow that it is\npossible that such folders *do* have their reference fixed by their\ncontents, but as long as this was not the intent in creation these\nfolders can suffice for *de re* belief. This point lets us distinguish\nbetween my folder for *Vulcan* and my folder for *The planet causing the\nperturbations of Mercury*. Both are individuated by the fact that they\ncontain the proposition *This* *causes the perturbations of Mercury*. It\nis this feature of the folder that fixes their reference, or in this\ncase their non-reference. Only in the latter case, however, was this the\nintent in creating the folder, so its contents are *de dicto* beliefs,\nwhile the contents of the former are *de re* beliefs.)\n\nNow we have the resources to show how Ralph can have *de re* beliefs\nconcerning Kilimanjaro. When Ralph hears about it, or sees it, he opens\na file folder for Kilimanjaro. This is not intended to merely be a\nfolder for the mountain he just heard about, or saw. It is intended to\nbe a folder for *that*. (Imagine here that I am demonstrating the\nmountain in question.) The Kripkenstein point about referential\nindeterminacy applies to folders as much as to words. This point is\nclosely related to Kripke's insistence that his indeterminacy argument\ndoes not rely on behaviourism. So if Ralph's folder is to have a\nreference, it must be fixed in part by the naturalness of various\nputative referents. But that is consistent with Ralph's folder\ncontaining *de re* beliefs, since unless Ralph is a certain odd kind of\nphilosopher, he will not have in his folder that Kilimanjaro is\npeculiarly eligible to be a referent. So the referent of the folder is\nnot fixed by its contents (as the referent for a folder about *The\nmountain over there, whatever it is*, would be, or how the referent for\na folder about *The natural object over there, whatever it is*, would\nbe), and the contents of this folder are still *de re* beliefs Ralph has\nabout Kilimanjaro. This was a bit roundabout, but we have seen that the\nProblem of the Many threatens neither the possibility that Ralph is the\nsubject of true *de re* belief ascriptions, nor that he actually has *de\nre* beliefs.\n\n### Vague Objects\n\n> \"I think the principle that to be is to be determinate is *a priori*,\n> and hence that it is *a priori* that there is no *de re* vagueness\".\n> [@Jackson2001 657-658]\n\nSo do I. I also think there are a few arguments for this claim, though\nsome of them may seem question-begging to the determined defender of\nindeterminate objects. Most of these arguments I will just mention,\nsince I assume the reader has little desire to see them detailed\n*again*. One argument is just that it is obvious that there is no *de\nre* vagueness. Such 'arguments' are not worthless. The best argument\nthat there are no true contradictions is of just this form, as\n@Priest1998 shows. And it's a good argument! Secondly, Russell's point\nthat *most* arguments for *de re* vagueness involve confusing what is\nrepresented with its representation still seems fair [@Russell1923].\nThirdly, even though the literature on this is a rather large, it still\nlooks like the Evans-Salmon argument against vague identities works, at\nleast under the interpretation David Lewis gives it, and this makes it\nhard to see how there could be vague objects\n[@Evans1978; @Salmon1981; @Lewis1988g]. Fourthly, Mark @Heller1996\nargues that we have to allow that referential terms are semantically\nvague. He says we have to do so to explain context dependence but there\nare a few other explanatory projects that would do just as well. Since\nsemantic conceptions of vagueness can explain all the data that are\ncommonly taken to support ontological vagueness, it seems theoretically\nunparsimonious to postulate ontological vagueness too. That's probably\nenough, but let me add one more argument to the mix. Accepting that\nKilimanjaro is be a vague material object distinct from both\nKilimanjaro(+) and Kilimanjaro(-) has either metaphysical or logical\ncosts. To prove this, I derive some rather unpleasant metaphysical\nconclusions from the assumption that Kilimanjaro is vague. The proofs\nwill use some contentious principles of classical logic, but rejecting\nthose, and hence rejecting classical logic, would be a substantial\nlogical cost. The most contentious such principle used will be an\ninstance of excluded middle: Sparky is or is not a part of Kilimanjaro.\nI also assume that if for all *x* other than Sparky that *x* is a part\nof *y* iff it is a part of *z*, then if Sparky is part of both *y* and\n*z*, or part of neither *y* nor *z*, then *y* and *z* coincide. If\nsomeone can contrive a mereological theory that rejects this principle,\nit will be immune to these arguments.\n\nIt is very plausible that material objects are individuated by the\nmaterials from which they are composed, so any coincident material\nobjects are identical. Properly understood, that is a good account of\nwhat it is to be material. The problem is getting a proper\nunderstanding. @Sider1996-SIDATW interprets it as saying that no two\nnon-identical material objects coincide *right now*. His project ends up\nrunning aground over concerns about sentences involving counting, but\nhis project, of finding a strong interpretation of the principle is\nintuitively compelling. David [@Lewis1986a Ch. 4] defends a slight\nweaker version: no two non-identical material objects coincide *at all\ntimes*. Call this the *strong composition principle* (scp). The scp is\n(classically) inconsistent with the hypothesis that Kilimanjaro is\nvague. If Sparky is part of Kilimanjaro, then Kilimanjaro and\nKilimanjaro(+) always coincide. If Sparky is not part of Kilimanjaro\nthen Kilimanjaro and Kilimanjaro(-) always coincide. Either way, two\nnon-identical objects always coincide, which the scp does not allow.\n\nSome think the scp is refuted by Gibbard's example of Lumpl and Goliath\n[@Gibbard1975]. The most natural response to Gibbard's example is to\nweaken our individuation principle again, this time to: no two\nnon-identical material objects coincide *in all worlds* *at all times*.\nCall this the *weak compositional principle* (wcp). Since there are\nworlds in which Goliath is composed of bronze, but Lumpl is still a lump\nof clay in those worlds, Lumpl and Goliath do not refute the wcp. Some\nmay think that even the wcp is too strong[^7], but most would agree that\nif vague objects violated the wcp, that would be a reason to believe\nthey don't exist.\n\nGiven a plausible metaphysical principle, which I call Crossover, vague\nobjects will violate the wcp. As shown above, Kilimanjaro actually\n(always) coincides with Kilimanjaro(+) or Kilimanjaro(-), but is not\nidentical with either. Crossover is the following principle:\n\nCrossover\n\n:   For any actual material objects *x* and *y* there is an object *z*\n    that coincides with *x* in the actual world and *y* in all other\n    worlds.\n\nGiven that arbitrary fusions exist, Crossover is entailed by, but does\nnot entail, the doctrine of arbitrary modal parts: that for any object\n*o* and world *w*, if *o* exists in *w* then *o* has a part that only\nexists in *w*. But Crossover does not have the most surprising\nconsequence of the doctrine of arbitrary modal parts: that for any\nobject *o* there is an object that has essentially all the properties\n*o* actually has.\n\nLet K1 be the object that coincides with Kilimanjaro in this world and\nKilimanjaro(+) in all other worlds. Let K2 be the object that coincides\nwith Kilimanjaro in this world and Kilimanjaro(-) in all other worlds.\nIf Sparky is part of Kilimanjaro then K1 and Kilimanjaro(+) coincide in\nall worlds, but they are not identical, since it is determinate that\nSparky is actually part of Kilimanjaro(+) and not determinate that it is\npart of K1. If Sparky is not part of Kilimanjaro then K2 and\nKilimanjaro(-) coincide in all worlds, but they are not identical, since\nit is determinate that Sparky is not actually part of Kilimanjaro(-) and\nnot determinate that it is not part of K2. Either way, we have a\nviolation of the wcp. So the following three claims are (classically)\ninconsistent.\n\n1.  Crossover.\n\n2.  The wcp.\n\n3.  Kilimanjaro is a vague object that indeterminately has Sparky as a\n    part.\n\nI think the first two are highly plausible, so accepting (c) is costly.\nI already noted the plausibility of the wcp, so the focus should be on\nCrossover. On Lewis's account of modality, it is clearly true, as is the\nstronger doctrine of arbitrary modal parts. On a fictionalist theory of\nmodality based on Lewis's account, it is still true, or at least true in\nthe fiction that we must adopt to make sense of modal talk. So the\nprinciple is not without merits. And dialectically, opposing Crossover\nwill be problematic for the believer in vague objects. Either an\nobject's modal profile is determined by its categorical properties or it\nisn't. If it is, then the wcp will entail the scp, so by the above\nreasoning vague objects will be inconsistent with the wcp. If it is not,\nthen it is hard to see why an object could not have a completely\narbitrary modal profile, say the profile of some other ordinary material\nobject. But that means Crossover is true, and again we cannot have both\nthe wcp and vague objects. Probably the best way out for the believer in\nvague objects will be to short-circuit this reasoning by abandoning\nclassical logic, presumably by declining to endorse the version of\nexcluded middle with which I started. But that is undoubtedly a costly\nmove, particularly for a supervaluationist.\n\n### McKinnon on Coins and Precisifications\n\nMost of our discussions of the Problem of the Many relate to the\nvagueness in a single singular term, and a single ordinary object. As\nMcKinnon reminds us, however, there is not just one mountain in the\nworld, there are many of them, and supervaluationists are obliged to say\nplausible things about statements that are about many mountains. Or, to\nfocus on McKinnon's example, we must not only have a plausible theory of\ncoins, but of coin exhibitions. These do raise distinctive problems.\nImagine we have an exhibition with, as we would ordinarily say, 2547\ncoins, each numbered in the catalogue. So to each number *n* there\ncorrespond millions of coin-like entities, coin\\*s in Sider's helpful\nphrase [@Sider2001], and each precisification assigns a coin\\* to a\nnumber. In general, Sider holds that something is an *F*\\* iff it has\nall the properties necessary and sufficient for being an *F* except the\nproperty of not massively overlapping another *F*. There are some\ninteresting questions about how independent these assignments can be. If\none precisification assigns coin\\* *c*~1~ to *n*~1~, and another assigns\ncoin\\* *c*~2~ to *n*~2~ (distinct from *n*~1~) then is there a\nguaranteed to be a precisification that assigns both *c*~1~ to *n*~1~\nand *c*~2~ to *n*~2~? In other words, may the precisifications of each\nnumeral (construed as a coin denotation) be *independent* of each other?\nThe following example suggests not. Say *C~j~* is the set of coin\\*s\nthat are possible precisifications of *j*. This set may be vague because\nof higher--order vagueness, but set those difficulties aside. If every\nmember of *C*~1728~ has a duplicate in *C*~1729~, then presumably only\nprecisifications that assigned duplicates to '1728' and '1729' would be\nadmissible. If the exhibition has two Edward I pennies on display to\nshow the obverse and reverse, and miraculously these coins are\nduplicates, such a situation will arise.\n\nThis case is fanciful, so we don't know whether in reality the\nprecisifications of the numerals are independent. We probably can't\nanswer this question, but this is no major concern. McKinnon has found a\nquestion which the supervaluationist should feel a need to answer, but\nto which neither answer seems appropriate. Say that a precisification is\n*principled* iff there is some not-too-disjunctive property *F* such\nthat for each numeral *n*, the precisification assigns to *n* the\n*F*-est coin\\* in *C~n~*. If *F* does not come in degrees, then the\nprecisification assigns to *n* the *F* in *C~n~*. McKinnon's question to\nthe supervaluationist is: Are all precisifications principled? He aims\nto show either answering 'yes' or 'no' gets the supervaluationist in\ntrouble. 'Yes' leads to there being too few precisifications; 'No' leads\nto there being too many. Let us look at these in order.\n\nI have little to say for now on the first horn of this dilemma.\nMcKinnon's survey of principled precisifications only considers cases\nwhere *F* is intrinsic, and I postpone for now investigation of\nextrinsic principles. Nevertheless, he does show that if *F* must be\nintrinsic, then there are not enough principled precisifications to\ngenerate all the indeterminacy our coin exhibit intuitively displays.\nThe other horn is trickier.\n\nA precisification must not only assign a plausible coin\\* to each\nnumeral, it must do so in such a way that respects penumbral\nconnections. McKinnon thinks that unprincipled, or *arbitrary*\nprecisifications, will violate (NAD) and (NAS).\n\nNon-Arbitrary Differences (NAD)\n\n:   For any coin and non-coin, there is a principled difference between\n    them which forms the basis for one being a coin and the other being\n    a non-coin.\n\nNon-Arbitrary Similarities (NAS)\n\n:   For any pair of coins, there is a principled similarity between them\n    which forms the basis for their both being coins.\n\nMcKinnon holds these are true, so they should be true on all\nprecisifications, but they are not true on unprincipled\nprecisifications, so unprincipled precisifications are unacceptable. The\nmotivation for (NAD) and (NAS) is clear. When we list the fundamental\nproperties of the universe, we will not include *being a coin*. Coinness\ndoesn't go that deep. So if some things are coins, they must be so in\nvirtue of their other properties. From this (NAD) and (NAS) follow.\n\nThe last step looks dubious. Consider any coin, for definiteness say the\nreferent of '1728', and a coin\\* that massively overlaps it. The coin\\*\nis not a coin, so (a) one of these is a coin and the other is not, and\n(b) the minute differences between them cannot form the basis for a\ndistinction between coins and non-coins. Hence (NAD) and (NAS) fail. At\nbest, it seems, we can justify the following claims. If something is a\ncoin\\* and something else is not, *then* there is a principled\ndifference between them that makes one of them a coin\\* and the other\nnot. Something is a coin iff it is a coin\\* that does not excessively\noverlap a coin. If this is the best we can do at defining 'coin', then\nthe prospects for a *reductive* physicalism about coins might look a\nlittle dim, though this is no threat to a physicalism about coins that\nstays neutral on the question of reduction. (I trust no reader is an\nanti-physicalist about coins, but it is worth noting how vexing\nquestions of reduction can get even when questions of physicalism are\nsettled.)\n\nSo I think this example refutes (NAD) and (NAS). Do I beg some questions\nhere? Well, my counterexample turns crucially on the existence of kinds\nof objects, massively overlapping coin\\*s, that some people reject, and\nindeed that some find the most objectionable aspect of the\nsupervaluationist solution. But this gets the burden of proof the wrong\nway around. I was not trying to refute (NAD) and (NAS). I just aimed to\nparry an argument based on those principles. I am allowed to appeal to\naspects of my theory in doing so without begging questions. I do not\nwant to rest too much weight on this point, however, for issues to do\nwith who bears the burden of proof are rarely easily resolved, so let us\nmove on.\n\nMy main response to McKinnon's dilemma is another dilemma. If the\nprincipled similarities and differences in (NAD) and (NAS) must be\nintrinsic properties, then those principles are false, because there is\nno principled intrinsic difference between a coin and a token, or a coin\nand a medal. If the principled similarities and differences in (NAD) and\n(NAS) may be extrinsic properties, then those principles may be true,\nbut then the argument that there are not enough principled\nprecisifications fail, since now we must consider precisifications based\non extrinsic principles. Let's look at the two halves of that dilemma in\ndetail, in order.\n\nA subway token is not a coin. Nor is a medal.[^8] But in their intrinsic\nrespects, subway tokens often resemble certain coins more than some\ncoins resemble other coins. Imagine we had a Boston subway token (which\nlooks a bit like an American penny, but larger), an American penny, a\nBritish 20p piece (which is roughly heptagonal) and an early Australian\nholey dollar (which has a hole in it). There is no non-disjunctive\nclassification of these by intrinsic properties that includes the penny,\nthe 20p piece and the holey dollar in one group, and the subway token in\nthe other. Any group that includes the penny and the other coins will\ninclude the token as well. So if we restrict attention to intrinsic\nsimilarities and differences, (NAD) and (NAS) are false.\n\nThere is a difference between these coins and the subway token. The\ncoins were produced with the intent of being legal tender, the token was\nnot. Perhaps we can find a difference between coins and non-coins based\non the intent of their creator.[^9] This might make (NAD) and (NAS)\ntrue. But note that given the theory of precisifications developed in\nsection 3, on every precisification, one and only one of the\nprecisifications of '1728' will be the subject of an intention on the\npart of its manufacturer. Just which of the objects is the subject of\nthis intent will vary from precisification to precisification, but there\nis only one on every precisification. So we can say that on every\nprecisification, *the* coin is the one where the intent of its creator\nwas that it be used in a certain way. Indeed, on any precisification we\nmay have antecedently thought to have existed, we can show that\nprecisification to be principled by taking *F* to be the property *being\ncreated with intent of being used in a coin-like way*.[^10] So now we\ncan say that restricting attention to the principled precisifications\ndoes not unduly delimit the class of precisifications.\n\nLet's sum up. To argue against the possibility of unprincipled\nprecisifications, McKinnon needed to justify (NAD) and (NAS). But these\nare only true when we allow 'principled differences' to include\ndifferences in creatorial intent. And if we do that we can see that\nevery *prima facie* admissible precisification is principled, so we can\ngive an affirmative answer to McKinnon's question.\n\nIt might be objected that this move relies heavily on the fact that for\nmany artefacts creative intent is constitutive of being the kind of\nthing that it is. But a Problem of the Many does not arise only for\nartefacts, so my solution does not generalise. This is little reason for\nconcern since McKinnon's problem does not generalise either. (NAD) and\n(NAS) are clearly false when we substitute 'mountain' for 'coin'.\nConsider a fairly typical case where it is indeterminate whether we have\none mountain or two.[^11] In this case it might be not clear whether,\nfor example, we have one mountain with a southern and a northern peak,\nor two mountains, one of them a little north of the other. Whether there\nis one mountain here or two, clearly the two peaks exist, and their\nfusion exists too. The real question is which of these three things is a\nmountain. However this question is resolved, a substitution instance of\n(NAD) with the two objects being the southern peak and the fusion of the\ntwo peaks will be false. So in this case a relatively unprincipled\nprecisification will be acceptable. The point here is that mountain\\*s\nthat are not mountains exist (either the peaks or their fusion will do\nas examples), and that suffices to refute McKinnon's alleged penumbral\nconnections and allow, in this case, a negative answer to his question.\n\n### Sorensen on Direct Reference\n\nAccording to orthodoxy, we can use descriptions to determine the\nreference of names without those descriptions becoming part of the\nmeaning of the name. This, apparently, is what happened when Leverrier\nintroduced 'Neptune' to *name*, not merely describe, the planet causing\ncertain perturbations, and when someone introduced 'Jack the Ripper' to\n*name*, not merely describe, the person performing certain murders. So\nlet us introduce 'Acme' as the name for the first tributary of the river\nEnigma. As Sorensen suggests, this can create certain problems.\n\n> When [explorers] first travel up the river Enigma they finally reach\n> the first pair of river branches. They name one branch 'Sumo' and the\n> other 'Wilt'. Sumo is shorter but more voluminous than Wilt. This\n> makes Sumo and Wilt borderline cases of 'tributary' ... 'Acme'\n> definitely refers to something, even though it is vague whether it\n> refers to Sumo and vague whether it refers to Wilt. [@Sorensen2000\n> 180]\n\nIf 'Acme', 'Sumo' and 'Wilt' are all vague names related in this way,\nSorensen thinks the supervaluationist has a problem. The sentences 'Acme\nis Sumo' and 'Acme is Wilt' both express propositions of the form\n$\\langle x = y \\rangle$. For exactly one of them, *x* is *y*. Since the\nproposition contains just the objects *x* and *y* (and the identity\nrelation) but not their route into the proposition, there is no\nvagueness in the proposition. Hence there is no way to precisify either\nproposition. So a supervaluationist cannot explain how these\npropositions are vague.\n\nThis is no problem for supervaluationism, since supervaluationism says\nthat *sentences*, not *propositions*, are vague. Indeed, most\nsupervaluationists would say that no proposition is ever vague. Thinking\nthey are vague is just another instance of the fallacy Russell\nidentified: attributing properties of the representation to the entity,\nin this case a proposition, represented.\n\nBut maybe there is a problem in the area. One natural way of spelling\nout the idea that names directly refer to objects is to say that the\n*meaning* of a name is its referent. And one quite plausible principle\nabout precisifications is that precisifications must not *change* the\nmeaning of a term, they may merely provide a meaning where none exists.\nNow the supervaluationist has a problem. For it is true that one of\nSorensen's identity sentences is true in virtue of its meaning, since\nits meaning determines that it expresses a proposition of the form\n$\\langle x = x \\rangle$. But each sentence is false on some\nprecisifications, so some precisifications change the meaning of the\nterms involved.\n\nThe best way to respond to this objection is simply to bite the bullet.\nWe can accept that some precisifications alter meanings provided we can\nprovide some other criteria for acceptability of precisifications. I\noffered one such proposal in section 2. An acceptable precisification\ntakes the partial order *more natural than*, turns it into a complete\norder without changing any of the relations that already exist, and uses\nthis new relation to generate meanings. If we proceed in this way it is\npossible, for all we have hitherto said, that on every precisification\nthe proposition expressed by 'Acme is Sumo' will be of the form\n$\\langle x = y \\rangle$, so just the named object, rather than the\nmethod of naming, gets into the proposition. The central point is that\nsince precisifications apply to the processes that turn semantic\nintentions into meanings, rather than to sentences with meanings, there\nis no guarantee they will preserve meanings. But if we like directly\nreferential theories of names we should think this perfectly natural. If\nnames are directly referential then Sorensen's argument that there are\nvague sentences that are true in virtue of their meaning works. But this\nis consistent with supervaluationism.\n\nOne challenge remains. If precisifications change meanings, why should\nwe care about them, or about what is true on all of them? This is not a\nnew challenge; it is a central plank in Jerry Fodor and Ernest Lepore's\n[-@Fodor1996] attack on supervaluationism. A simple response is just to\nsay that we should care about precisifications because this method\ndelivers the right results in all core cases, and an intuitively\nplausible set of results in contentious cases. This kind of\ninstrumentalism about the foundations of a theory is not always\nsatisfying.[^12] But if that's the biggest problem supervaluationists\nhave, they should be able to sleep a lot easier than the rest of us.\n\n### Conclusions and Confessions\n\nI have spent a fair bit of time arguing that supervaluationism is not\nvulnerable to a few challenges based on the Problem of the Many. Despite\ndoing all this, I don't believe supervaluationism to be quite true. So\nwhy spend this time? Because the true theory of vagueness will be a\n*classical semantic* theory, and everything I say about\nsupervaluationism above applies *mutatis mutandis* to all classical\nsemantic theories. I focussed on supervaluationism because it is more\nfamiliar and more popular, but I need not have.\n\nWhat is a classical semantic theory? That's easy - it's a theory that is\nboth classical and semantic. What is a classical theory? It is one that\nincorporates vagueness while preserving classical logic. How much of\nclassical logic must we preserve? That's a hard question, though it is\nrelevant to determining whether supervaluationism is (as it is often\nadvertised) a classical theory. @Williamson1994-WILV notes that\nsupervaluationism does not preserve classical inference rules, and\n@Hyde1997 notes that it does not preserve some classically valid\nmultiple--conclusion sequents. @Keefe2000 argues that neither of these\nconstitutes an important deviation from classical logic. I'm inclined to\ndisagree with Keefe on both points. Following Read (2000), I take it\nthat the best response to the anti-classical arguments in\n@Dummett1991 takes the essential features of classical logic to be its\ninferential rules as formulated in a multiple--conclusion logic. But we\nneed not adjudicate this dispute here. Why should we want a classical\ntheory? The usual arguments for it are based on epistemic conservatism,\nand I think these arguments are fairly compelling. I also think that no\nnon--classical theory will be able to provide a plausible account of\nquantification.[^13]\n\nWhat is a semantic theory? It is one that makes vagueness a semantic\nphenomenon. It is not necessarily one that makes vagueness a\n*linguistic* phenomenon. That would be absurd in any case, since clearly\nsome non--linguistic entities, maps, beliefs and pictures for example,\nare vague. But the more general idea that vagueness is a property only\nof representations is quite attractive. It links up well with the theory\nof content Lewis outlines in \"Languages and Language\" - all Languages\n(in his technical sense) are precise, vagueness in natural language is a\nresult of indecision about which Language we are speaking.\n\nTrenton @Merricks2001 argues against this picture, claiming that all\nsemantic vagueness (he says 'linguistic', but ignore that) must arise\nbecause of metaphysical or epistemic vagueness. He claims that if (17)\nis vague, then so is (18), and (18)'s vagueness must be either\nmetaphysical or semantic.\n\n1.  Harry is bald.\n\n2.  'Bald' describes Harry.\n\nOne might question the inference from (17)'s vagueness to (18) - on some\nsupervaluational theories if (17) is vague then (18) is false. But I\nwill let that pass, for there is a simpler problem in the argument.\nMerricks claims that if (18) is vague, then it is vague whether 'Bald'\nhas the property *describing Harry*, and this is a kind of metaphysical\nvagueness. It is hard to see how this follows. If there is metaphysical\nvagueness, there is presumably some object *o* and some property *F*\nsuch that it is vague whether the object has the property. Presumably\nthe object here is the word 'bald' and the property is *describing\nHarry*. But words alone do not have properties like *describing Harry*.\nAt best, words in languages do so. So maybe the object can be the\nordered pair $\\langle \\text{`Bald'}, l \\rangle$, where *l* is a\nlanguage. But which one? Not one of Lewis's Languages, for then it is\ndeterminate whether \\<'Bald', *l*\\> has the property *describing Harry*.\nSo maybe a natural language, perhaps English! But it is doubly unclear\nthat English is an object. First, it is unclear whether we should reify\nnatural languages to such a degree that we accept that 'English' refers\nto anything at all. Secondly, if we say 'English' does refer, why not\nsay that it refers to one of Lewis's Languages, thought it is vague\nwhich one? That way we can say that the sentence *'Bald' in English\ndescribes Harry* is vague without there being any object that vaguely\ninstantiates a property. Now on a supervaluational theory this approach\nmay have the unwanted consequence that \"English is a precise language\"\nis true, since it is true on all precisifications. It does not seem that\n*this* problem for the supervaluationist generalises to be a problem for\nall semantic theories of vagueness, so Merricks has raised no general\nproblem for semantic theories of vagueness. (The problem for the\nsupervaluationist here is not new. For some discussion see Lewis's\nresponse, in \"Many, but Almost One\" to the objection, there attributed\nto Kripke, that the supervaluationist account makes it true that all\nwords are precise.)\n\nIf we have a classical semantic theory that provides a concept of\ndeterminateness, then we can define acceptable precisifications as\nmaximal consistent extensions of the set of determinate truths. Given\nthat, it follows pretty quickly that determinate truth implies truth on\nall precisifications. And this is sufficient for the major objections\ncanvassed above to get a foothold, and hence be worthy of response,\nthough as we have seen none of them will ultimately succeed. Still, our\ntheory may differ from supervaluationism in many ways. For one thing, it\nmight *explain* determinateness in ways quite different from those in\nsupervaluationism. For example, the theory in @Field2000 is a classical\nsemantic theory[^14], but it clearly goes beyond supervaluational theory\nbecause it has an interesting, if ultimately flawed, explanation of\ndeterminateness in terms of Shafer functions. Other classical semantic\ntheories may differ from supervaluationism by providing distinctive\ntheories of higher order vagueness.\n\nThe most promising research programs in vagueness are within the\nclassical semantic framework. Like all research programs, these programs\nneed a defensive component, to fend off potential refutations and\ncrisis. This avoids unwanted crises in the program, and as we have seen\nhere we can learn a bit from seeing how to defend against certain\nattacks. There will undoubtedly be more challenges in the time ahead,\nbut for now the moves in this paper brings the defensive side of the\nprogram up to date.\n\n[^1]: Following Schiffer, we ignore the vagueness in 'is where Harold\n    and I first danced the rumba.' This phrase is vague, but its\n    vagueness raises no extra issues of philosophical importance.\n\n[^2]: Thanks to John Hawthorne for the following argument.\n\n[^3]: I do not mean here to commit myself to anything like the language\n    of thought hypothesis. This is just being used as a convenient\n    shorthand.\n\n[^4]: This is hard, but not perhaps impossible. One might say that on\n    every precisification, Ralph believes a proposition that has a\n    mountain as a constituent, and hence as an essential part.\n\n[^5]: I don't know if Jeshion would accept the corollary that if belief\n    is too unstructured to allow for the possibility of such\n    organisational roles, then there is no *de re* belief, but I do.\n\n[^6]: Which is not just to say that there is no object that has all the\n    properties in the folder. This is neither necessary nor sufficient\n    for the folder to be about the object, as Kripke's discussion of\n    'famous deeds' descriptivism should make clear.\n\n[^7]: Kit @Fine1994 does exactly this.\n\n[^8]: Some people I have asked think tokens are coins, but no one thinks\n    medals are coins, so if you (mistakenly) think tokens are coins,\n    imagine all my subsequent arguments are phrased using medals rather\n    than tokens.\n\n[^9]: Note that I say little here about what the intent of the creator\n    must be. I don't think that the intent must always be to create\n    legal tender. A ceremonial coin that is created, for example, to be\n    tossed before the start of a sporting match is still a coin,\n    although it is not intended to be tender. But intent still matters.\n    If someone had made a duplicate of that ceremonial coin with the\n    intent of awarding it as a medal to the victorious captain, it would\n    be a medal and not a coin.\n\n[^10]: Because of the problems raised in the previous footnote, I will\n    not try and say just what this intention amounts to. There are\n    complications when (a) the creator is a corporate entity rather than\n    an individual and (b) the coins are mass--produced rather than\n    produced individually. But since the story is essentially the same,\n    I leave the gruesome details out here.\n\n[^11]: This case is rather important in the history of the problem,\n    because its discussion in @Quine1960 is one of the earliest\n    presentations in print of anything like the problem of the many.\n\n[^12]: The largest debate in the history of philosophy of economics\n    concerned whether we could, or should, be instrumentalists about the\n    ideally rational agents at the core of mainstream microeconomic\n    theory. See @Friedman1953 for the classic statement of the\n    instrumentalist position, and @Hausman1992 for the most amusing and\n    enlightening of the countably many responses.\n\n[^13]: See the last section of @Weatherson2005-WEATTT for a detailed\n    defence of this claim.\n\n[^14]: At least, it strikes me as a classical semantic theory. Ryan\n    Wasserman has tried to convince me that properly understood, it is\n    really an epistemic theory. Space prevents a thorough account of why\n    I think Field's theory is flawed. Briefly, I think the point in\n    @Leeds2000 that Field's concept of a numerical degree of belief\n    needs *substantially* more explanation than Field gives it can be\n    developed into a conclusive refutation.\n",
