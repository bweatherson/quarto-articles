Let's say we\nhave a particular parcel of land that groups A and B want. They each\nwant it quite strongly, but B has deeper pockets than A, so while A\nwould be prepared to pay 8 for the land, B would be prepared to pay 12.\nFor the auction process to function, there must be a minimum bid\nincrement, I'll say it is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Assume that B has just bid 4, A\nmust now choose whether to bid 4$\\frac{1}{2}$ or accept B's bid. And\nassume for now that A is not bidding tactically, it only makes a bid if\nit would prefer to win the auction with that bid than accept B's bid.\nThis assumption will be relaxed below.\n\nSo for now, A must decide whether it prefers to be given 4, or to get\nthe land for 4$\\frac{1}{2}$. Since it values the land at 8, and since it\nwill give up 8$\\frac{1}{2}$ to buy the land (the 4$\\frac{1}{2}$ it will\npay, plus the 4 it would have received from B) it may well decide to\njust accept the bid. But now it has ended up with something it\ndefinitely does *not* prefer to the land, since it just accepted a bid\nfor 4. There are two assumptions at play here. One is that A doesn't bid\ntactically, which I shall return to a bit. The other is that how much A\nwill pay for the land is not affected by receiving B's 4. That is, I\nassume that the marginal utility of money is relatively constant for A\nover the ranges of money at play in the auction. This assumption might\nbe false if we're dealing with a very large or valuable body of land,\nbut it's not unreasonable in most circumstances. (Space prevents a\ncomplete study of what happens if we take the declining marginal utility\nof money completely into account. Roughly, the effect is that some of my\ncriticisms are *slightly* vitiated.) Now while these assumptions *might*\nbe false, Steiner and Wolff give us no reason to be certain they are\nfalse. So for all they've said we could have a situation just like this\none, where the poorer party ends up with something it wants much less\nthan the land. Hence\n\n> **Objection 1**. There is no guarantee that the losing party will end\n> up with something they prefer to the land.\n\nWhile this contradicts an alleged benefit of Steiner and Wolff's plan,\nit might not be thought to be a deep problem. After all, A gets half as\nmuch as they wanted, and if they are only one of two equal claimants to\nthe land, then this is a fair result. This *may* be true, but note that\nthe assumption that each party has an equal claim to the land is doing a\nlot of work here. If A's claim is stronger, then only getting half of\nthe value of the land is quite unfair. If the two claims are\nincommensurable, there may be no fact of the matter whether it is fair\nthat A receives 4. If we cannot tell which of the moral claims is\nstronger, which is very often the case in land disputes, it may be\nimpossible to tell whether A's receiving 4 is fair or not. Hence\n\n> **Objection 2**. The proposal is only appropriate where each party has\n> a genuinely equal moral claim to the land. This doesn't happen often,\n> and it is quite rare that we know it happens.\n\nWhile Steiner and Wolff note that they are leaving questions about\nenforcement and compliance to another place, so it isn't fair to press\nthem too strongly on these topics, it is worth noting how this feature\nof their proposal makes compliance harder to enforce. If by\nparticipating in the auction both parties are tacitly agreeing that the\nother party has an equal claim to the land, and I think the above\nsuggests they are doing just this, that will reduce the legitimacy of\nthe auction process in the eyes of members of the losing group. And that\nwill lead to enforcement difficulties down the line.\n\nThere is an administrative problem lurking around here. Since each party\nwill end up with something from this process once the auction begins, we\nmust have a way of determining whether the competing claims warrant an\nauction, or whether one party should receive the land, or whether some\nkind of negotiation is possible. And once we set up a process to do\nthat, it could easily encourage relatively spurious land claims. Unless\nthere is a serious cost to suggesting that one should be party to an\nauction of some block of land, there is a large incentive to get into\nthese auctions wherever and whenever possible. Perhaps some method could\nbe designed to offset this incentive, and perhaps even the desire groups\nhave to be approved by the court of public opinion will offset it at\ntimes, but it seems to be a problem with the proposal as formulated.\n\nTo be sure, if A accepts B's bid, then both parties do end up with\n*something* from the auction. A gets 4, and B gets some land that it\nvalues at 12 for 4, a gain of 8. Note that B does much better out of the\nauction than A. If the auction stops when the richer party makes a bid\nat or above half the price the poorer party would pay, then the richer\nparty will always end up with a higher 'utility surplus'. Hence\n\n> **Objection 3**. If there's no tactical bidding the utility surplus is\n> given entirely to the richer party.\n\nLet's relax the assumption that A does not bid tactically. Indeed, let's\nmake things as good as could be realistically expected for A. It knows\nthat B values the land at 12 and does not bid tactically, so B will make\nbids up to 6, and accept any bid over 6. Hence the auction proceeds as\nfollows: A bids 4$\\frac{1}{2}$, B bids 5, A bids 5$\\frac{1}{2}$, B bids\n6, A accepts. Now things *could* go better for A, but it would require\nsome luck and courage. A could bid 6$\\frac{1}{2}$ and B could reply with\na bid of 7, but since this requires B acting against its own interests\n(it is better off accepting the bid of 6$\\frac{1}{2}$ after all), and\nhence also requires A making a risky move that will only yield dividends\nonly if B acts against its own interests in just this way, such an\noutcome seems unlikely. So in practice the best case scenario for A is\nthat B pays 6 for the land. In this case A ends up with 6, and B ends up\npaying 6 for land it values at 12, a gain of 6. Hence\n\n> **Objection 4**. Among the realistic outcomes, the best case scenario\n> for the poorer party is that it ends up with as large a utility\n> surplus as the richer party.\n\nBest cases don't often happen, so in practice we should normally expect\na result somewhere between the 'no tactical bargaining' option, where B\nreceives a larger share of the surplus, and this 'best case scenario'\nwhere the two parties get an equal share of the surplus. Hence in almost\nall cases, the richer party will get a larger surplus than the poorer\nparty. This seems like a flaw in the proposal, but worse is to come.\nMost of the ways in which B can realistically increase its share of the\nsurplus involve behaviour that we should not want to encourage.\n\nConsider again A's decision to reject the bid of 5 and bid\n5$\\frac{1}{2}$. Assume, for simplicity, that A plans to accept a bid of\n6, but drop the assumption that A knows that B will reject a bid of\n5$\\frac{1}{2}$, if it is made. So before A makes its decision, there are\nthree possible outcomes it faces:\n\nIn this case it receives 5.\n\nIn this case it gets the land (value 8) for 5$\\frac{1}{2}$, net gain\n2$\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIn this case B bids 6, and A accepts, so it gets 6.\n\nA's expected utility is higher if it bids 5$\\frac{1}{2}$ rather than\naccepts B's bid iff its degree of belief that B will bid 6 is over\n$\\frac{5}{7}$. If it is less confident than that that B will bid 6, it\nshould accept the bid of 5. As it happens, B *is* going to reject a bid\nof 5$\\frac{1}{2}$ and bid 6, so it is better off if A accepts the bid of\n5. If A knows B's plans, this will not happen. But if A is ignorant of\nB's intentions, it is possible it will accept the bid of 5. Indeed,\nsince A's confidence that B will decline must be as high as\n$\\frac{5}{7}$ before it makes the bid of 5$\\frac{1}{2}$, it might be\nquite likely in this case that A will just accept the bid.\n\nNot surprisingly, we get the result that B is better off if its\nbargaining plans are kept secret than if they are revealed to A. That in\nitself may not be objectionable. But remember that the agents here are\nnot individuals, they are states. And the decisions about how to bid\ninvolve policy questions that will often be the most important issue the\nstate in question faces for many a year. Ideally, decisions about how to\napproach the auction should be decided as democratically as possible.\nBut democratic decision making requires openness, and it is impossible\nthat all the stakeholders in B, including one imagines the citizens, can\nparticipate in the decision about how to approach the auction without B\ntipping its hand. In the modern world it's impossible to involve\neveryone in B without opening the debate to agents of A. And this, as\nwe've seen, probably has costs. Since B is better off if it does not\nmake decisions about how to approach the auction in the open, we have\n\n> **Objection 5**. The proposal favours secretive governments over open\n> democratic governments.\n\nAssume that B has been somewhat secretive, but A is still fairly\nconfident that B will not accept a bid of 5$\\frac{1}{2}$. Its degree of\nbelief that such a bid will be rejected is $\\frac{3}{4}$, let's say, so\nit is disposed to gamble and make that bid. But now B starts making some\nnoises about what it will do with any money it gets from A. The primary\nbeneficiary of this windfall will be B's military. And the primary use\nof this military is to engage in military conflicts with A. While some\nof these engagements will be defensive, if A gets the land under dispute\nmany will be offensive. (I don't think these assumptions are\nparticularly fanciful in many of the land disputes we see in the modern\nworld.) A must take this into account when making its decisions. It\nseems reasonable to say that every 1 that A gives B has a disutility of\n1.2 for A, 1 for the cost of the money it gives up, and 0.2 for the\nextra damage it may suffer when that money is turned into weaponry\nturned back against A. Now the utility calculations are quite different.\nIf B accepts A's bid of 5$\\frac{1}{2}$, A's balance sheet will look like\nthis:\n\nThe land, value 8.\n\n5$\\frac{1}{2}$ paid to B, value 5$\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nB's extra military capability, value (a little over) 1.\n\nRoughly 1$\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo now the expected utility of bidding 5$\\frac{1}{2}$ is:\n\n> Prob(Bid Accepted) Utility(Bid Accepted) + Prob(Bid Rejected)\n> Utility(Bid Rejected)\\\n> $\\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{4} \\times 6$\\\n> = $4\\frac{7}{8}$\n\nHence A's expected utility for accepting B's bid of 5, i.e. 5, is higher\nthan its expected utility of bidding 5$\\frac{1}{2}$, so it will accept\nthe bid, just as B wanted it to do. So if B indicates that it will use\nany payments from A to attack A, it may well be able to get the land for\nless. Hence\n\n> **Objection 6**. The proposal favours belligerent governments over\n> peaceful governments.\n\nOne qualification to this objection is that what matters here is what A\nthinks B will do, not what B actually does. So the objection is not that\nthe proposal rewards offensive behaviour, but that it rewards\nbelligerence, or indications of offensive behaviour. This isn't *as bad*\nas rewarding military action, but it is still objectionable.\n\nThroughout I have used a particular example to make the points clearer,\nnone of the arguments turns on the details of this example. What matters\nis that in any case where one party is able to spend more for the land\nin question simply because they are richer, the richer party will almost\ninevitably have a higher utility surplus, and this party can increase\ntheir expected utility surplus by being more secretive about their\nplans, and by being adopting a more belligerent tone towards their\nrivals before and during the auction. So it seems the proposal\nsystematically rewards behaviour we should be discouraging.\n\nThe remaining objections concern the implementation of Steiner and\nWolff's proposal. While I don't have a demonstrative proof that any of\nthese concerns present insurmountable difficulties, they all suggest\nways in which the proposal must be qualified if it is to be just.\n\nThe proposal seems to assume that the parties to the dispute agree over\nwhether the land in question can be divided. As Steiner and Wolff put\nit, \"The auction can thus be viewed as a device for achieving a fair\nsettlement for the disposition of a good when neither division nor joint\nownership is acceptable to the parties.\" In some conflicts at least part\nof what is at issue is whether the land can be divided. For instance, if\nwe were applying this proposal as a way of settling the war between\nBritain and Ireland in 1921, would we say that all of Ireland should be\nauctioned off, or just that the six counties that became Northern\nIreland should be auctioned? Assuming the British had decided that\ngoverning southern Ireland had become too much trouble and were only\ninterested in retaining the north, they may not have wanted to pay for\nthe whole country just to protect their interests in the north. But at\nleast some of the Irish would have been unwilling to accept a process\nthat may have led to the division of the country, as would have obtained\nhad the south been granted Home Rule, but the north left subject to an\nauction. (The historical facts are, obviously, somewhat more complicated\nthan I've sketched here, but even when those complications are\nconsidered the difficulties that must be overcome before we know how to\napply the proposal to a real situation are formidable.) Hence\n\n> **Objection 7**. The proposal assumes a mechanism for determining\n> which land is indivisible, and in some cases developing such a process\n> is no easier than settling the dispute.\n\nSteiner and Wolff assume that the groups, A and B, are easily\nidentifiable. In practice, this may not be so easy. For example, at\nleast some people in Scotland would prefer that Scotland was\nindependent. For now most people prefer devolution to independence (and\nsome would prefer rule from Westminster) but we can easily imagine\ncircumstances in which the nationalist support would rise to a level\nwhere it became almost a majority. If a majority in Scotland wants to\nsecede, and the British government is willing to do this, then\npresumably they will just secede. But what are we to do if a narrow\nmajority in Scotland wants to secede, and the British government (or\npeople) do not want them to go? Presumably Steiner and Wolff's proposal\nis that some sort of auction should be held to determine who should be\nin charge of the land. But who exactly are meant to be the parties? On\nthe Westminster side, is the party Britain as a whole, or Britain except\nfor Scotland? On the Scottish side, is it the Scottish people? The\nScottish government, which for now is a creature that exists at the\npleasure of the British Parliament? Those people who support Scottish\nindependence? If the last, how shall we determine just who these people\nare? Perhaps some one or other of these answers can be defended, but the\nproposal is seriously incomplete, hence\n\n> **Objection 8**. There is no mechanism for determining who shall count\n> as a member of the groups in question.\n\nFinally, the proposal simply assumes that we can agree upon the currency\nin which the auction shall be conducted, but it is not ever so clear\nthat this can be done. Usually, the two parties to a dispute will use\ndifferent currencies, so to avoid conflicts it would be best if the\nauction were conducted in a neutral currency. But finding such a\ncurrency may be non-trivial. There are only a handful of currencies in\nthe world whose supply is sufficiently abundant to conduct an auction of\nthis size, and most of the time those currencies will be backed by\ngovernments who favour one side in the dispute. If they use this\nfavouritism to provide access to credit denominated in their currency at\na discounted rate, that threatens the fairness of the auction. Hence\n\n> **Objection 9**. The proposal assumes a given currency in which to\n> conduct the auction, but in practice any choice of currency may favour\n> one side.\n\nThe last three objections are, as mentioned, somewhat administrative. It\nis possible that in a particular situation they could be overcome,\nthough I think that it is more likely that they would pose serious\ndifficulties to a would-be auction-wielding pacifier. But that's not the\nserious problem with the proposal. The real problem, as the first six\nobjections show, is that it favours rich, secretive, belligerent states\nthat are disposed to make spurious land claims over poor, democratic,\npacifist states that only make genuine land claims.\n\n\n",
