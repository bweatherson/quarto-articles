For example, the local\nconditions of being reflexive ($Rxx$) and being reflexive with reflexive\nsuccessors ($Rxx \\land \\forall y(Rxy \\rightarrow Ryy)$) are distinct,\nbut their universal possession by the points in a frame describes the\nsame global condition of reflexivity. As a consequence, the\nnon-equivalent modal axioms $\\Box p\\rightarrow p$ and\n$(\\Box p\\rightarrow p) \\land \\Box(\\Box q\\rightarrow q)$ both define the\nclass of reflexive frames. This example leads Humberstone to ask (189)\nwhether there is a local property not implying that a point possessing\nit is reflexive whose universal possession makes the frame reflexive.\nAffirmative answers are supplied by the following formulas:\n$\\forall y(y{=}x\\wedge Rxx) \\vee (\\exists y(y\\ne x) \\wedge \\forall y(y\\ne x \\rightarrow Ryy))$\n(either x is the only world and it is reflexive or else there are other\nworlds, all of which are reflexive), and\n$\\exists zRxz \\wedge \\forall z(Rzx \\rightarrow Rzz)$ (x has a successor\nand every world that can see x is reflexive). The second example implies\nthat the tense-logical formulas\n${\\mathbf{F}}\\top \\wedge \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{G}p\\rightarrow p)$ and\n$\\mathbf{G}p\\rightarrow p$ both define the class of reflexive frames.\n\n### Fully Modalized Logics\n\nAnother topic that gets well-deserved attention in @Humberstone2016 is\nthe property of logics that Humberstone calls being \"fully modalized.\"\n(See 290-304.) The idea is that in alethic modal systems the axiom\n$\\Box A\\rightarrow A$ provides a logical connection between the modal\nand nonmodal formulas, whereas in a doxastic or deontic logic we expect\nthat matters concerning what is believed or what ought to be the case\nshould be logically independent of those concerning what is the case.\nThe latter, but not the former, are fully modalized. But the idea needs\nto formulated with some care because we don't want the presence of, for\nexample, $A\\rightarrow \\Box \\top$ as a theorem to count against a\nlogic's being fully modalized. As Humberstone puts it, in a fully\nmodalized logic, \"...we don't expect...the forging of any...logical\nconnections between $\\Box A$ and $A$ for any given $A$ -- other than\nthose which hold...derivatively\" (291). The notion is captured in a\nrather complicated way by E. Zolin in @Zolin.2000 and Humberstone shows\nthat the characterization there is equivalent to the following simpler\none: if there is a theorem of the form $M\\vee N$ where $M$ is fully a\nfully modalized formula (i.e., containing no sentence letters not within\nthe scope of a modal operator) and $N$ is non-modal (i.e., containing no\noccurrences of modal operators) then either $M$ or $N$ is itself a\ntheorem. In this section we show that Zolin's characterization is also\nequivalent to an even simpler one that is closer in spirit to the\nmotivating remarks in @Humberstone2016: every theorem is a tautological\nconsequence of a fully modalized theorem. (Thus the theorems can be\ndivided into two categoriesthe essentially nonmodal ones, i.e., the\ntautologies, and the essentially modal ones, i.e., the non-tautologies\nthat are tautological consquences of fully modalized theorems).\n\nWe begin by restating Zolin's definition in our own terminology. If\n$p_1,{\\ldots},p_n$ are sentence letters, then a state description in\n${p_1,{\\ldots},p_n}$ is a conjunction\n$p_1^*\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge p_n^*$, where, for $1\\le i\\le n, p_i^*$ is\neither $p_i$ or $\\neg p_i$. The (truth-functional) constituents of a\nformula $A$ are the sentence-letters and $\\Box$-formulas occurring in\n$A$ that do not properly occur within the scope of any $\\Box$. Zolin\nobserves that every formula $A$ can be \"decomposed\" into a formula of\nthe form ${\\bigvee}\\{(\\vec{p}\\wedge B(\\vec{p}))\\!:\\vec{p}$ is a state\ndescription in the sentence letter constituents of $A$}, where, for each\n$\\vec{p}$ , $B(\\vec{p})$ is some truth functional combination of the\nmodal constituents of $A$. By fixing on a particular ordering of\nformulas and taking the $B(\\vec{p})$'s to be in a disjunctive normal\nform that conforms to this ordering, we can single out a unique\ndecomposition of this kind. Let's call it the *Zolin form* of $A$ and\nlet's call the formulas $B(\\vec{p})$ that occur as right conjunct of a\ndisjunct in the Zolin form of $A$, the *Zolin components* of $A$. Note\nthat every formula is truth-funtionally equivalent to its Zolin form.\nThen, according to Zolin's definition, a logic is fully modalized if\n$\\vdash A$ implies $\\vdash B(\\vec{p})$ for every $B(\\vec{p})$ that is a\nZolin component of $A$.\n\n::: {.theorem}\n**Theorem 1**. *A logic L is fully modalized (according to Zolin's\ndefinition) iff every theorem of L is a tautological consequence of a\nfully modalized theorem.*\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n*Proof.* (Left to right). Suppose L satisfies Zolin's definition and\n$\\vdash_L A$. Let\n$(\\vec{p}_1\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_1))\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee (\\vec{p}_n\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_n))$\nbe the Zolin form of $A$. Then, according to Zolin's definition,\n$\\vdash_L B(\\vec{p}_i)$ for each $i$, $1\\le i\\le n$. Let\n$A^\\prime = B(\\vec{p}_1)\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_n)$. $A^\\prime$\nis fully modalized and, since each of its conjuncts is provable in L,\n$A^\\prime$ is as well. All that remains is to show that $A$ is a\ntruth-functional consequence of $A^\\prime$. Let $\\alpha$ be any\nassignment of truth values to the constituents of $A$ such that\n$\\alpha\\models A^\\prime$. Let $\\vec{p}_\\alpha$ be the state description\nin the sentence letters that are truth-functional constiuents of $A$\nthat corresponds to $\\alpha$ in the sense that each conjunct of\n$\\vec{p}_\\alpha$ is the literal $p$ or $\\neg p$ according to whether\n$\\alpha(p)$ is true or false. Then $\\alpha$ verifies\n$(\\vec{p}_\\alpha \\wedge B(\\vec{p}_\\alpha))$, which is a disjunct of $A$\nand so $\\alpha\\models A$ as required.\n\n(Right to left). We are given that every theorem of L is a tautological\nconsequence of some fully modalized theorem. Now suppose $\\vdash_L A$\nand $B(\\vec{p})$ is a Zolin component of $A$, with a view towards\nshowing $\\vdash_L B(\\vec{p})$. By the initial suppositions, $A$ is a\ntruth-functional consequence of some fully modalized formula $A^\\prime$.\nThen the Zolin form of $A$, call it\n$(\\vec{p}_1\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_1))\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee (p_n\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_n))$,\nis also a truth functional consequence of $A^\\prime$, where for some\n$i$, $1\\le i\\le n$, $B(\\vec{p}_i)=B(\\vec{p})$. We show that $B(\\vec{p})$\nis provable in L by showing that it is also a truth-functional\nconsequence of the theorem $A^\\prime$. To that end, let $\\alpha$ be any\nassignment of truth values to the constituents of $A$, such that\n$\\alpha\\models A^\\prime$. Since $A^\\prime$ is fully modalized, its truth\nvalue under an assignment is not affected by the truth assignments to\nsentence letters, so we can assume without loss of generality that these\nconform to the state description . Since the disjunction\n$(\\vec{p}_1\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_1))\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee (\\vec{p}_n\\wedge B(\\vec{p}_n))$\nis a truth functional consequence of $A^\\prime$, $\\alpha$ must verify\nthis disjunction. But $\\vec{p}_1,{\\ldots},\\vec{p}_n$ are state\ndescriptions, so $\\alpha$ can verify only one disjunct of this formula,\nnamely $\\wedge B(\\vec{p})$. Hence $\\alpha\\models B(\\vec{p})$ as\nrequired. ◻\n:::\n\nIt is possible that there are applications for which Zolin's more\ndetailed normal-form characterization of a fully modalized logic is more\nuseful than the simple characterization given here. But the proof below\nshows that property that Humberstone extracts in @Humberstone2016 can be\nproved at least as easily from our simple characterization.\n\n::: {.theorem}\n**Theorem 2**. *Suppose every theorem of L is a tautological consequence\nof a fully modalized theorem. Then $\\vdash_LM\\vee N$ where $M$ is fully\nmodalized and $N$ is modality-free implies either $\\vdash_LM$ or\n$\\vdash_LN$.*\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n*Proof.* Assume the hypothesis of the claim and $\\vdash_LM\\vee N$ for\nappropriate $M$ and $N$. Then there is some fully modalized L-theorem\n$A^\\prime$ such that $M\\vee N$ is a truth functional consequence of\n$A^\\prime$. Suppose for reductio that neither $M$ nor $N$ is provable.\nThen neither $M$ nor $N$ is a truth functional consequence of\n$A^\\prime$. So there is an assignment $\\alpha$ of truth values to the\nconstituents of $A^\\prime$ and $M$ that makes the former true and the\nlatter false. Similarly, there is an assignment $\\beta$ to the\nconstituents of $A^\\prime$ and $N$ that makes $A^\\prime$ true and $N$\nfalse. Now extend the assignment $\\alpha$ to the sentence letters in $N$\nby assigning them the same truth values as $\\beta$ does, and call the\nresult $\\alpha^\\prime$. Since $\\alpha^\\prime$ agrees with $\\alpha$ on\nthe modal constituents it verifies $A^\\prime$ and falsifies $M$. Since\nit agrees with $\\beta$ on sentence letters, it falsifies $N$. This\ncontradicts the earlier observation that $(M\\vee N)$ is a truth\nfunctional consequence of $A^\\prime$. ◻\n:::\n\n### \"Nothing in Between\" and the Equivalence of Modal Logics\n\nThe impetus for Section 4.4 of Humberstone's book (304-324) is Arthur\nPrior's observation that the logical structure of moral concepts appears\nto be unlike those of quantity and alethic modality:\n\n> In between \"S must be P\" and \"S may be P\" stands the simple \"S is in\n> fact P\", just as \"This S is P stands in between \"Every S is P and\n> \"Some S is P\". ... But so far as I can see there is nothing among the\n> moral or 'deontic' modalities that corresponds to these intermediary\n> 'existential' or 'alethic' modalities. (@prior1951ethical p145, quoted\n> on 304 in @Humberstone2016.)\n\nEarly in the section,Humberstone notes that, in fact, there are strict\nlogical intermediaries between \"$A$ is obligatory\" and \"$A$ is\npermitted\" or indeed between any sentences $A$ and B of decreasing\nlogical strength in any reasonably well behaved modal logic, whether\ntheir connectives are given a deontic reading or any other. For one can\nsimply take as intermediary, any formula $A\\vee (B\\wedge p)$ where $p$\nis a sentence letter that does not occur in $A$ or $B$. In this section\nwe wish to point out that a consequence of this observation is that\nthere is a sense in which all modal logics meeting certain minimal\nrequirements are the same.\n\nWe identify a \"logic\" with a many-one deducibility relation on formulas\nsatisfying the usual structural conditions. (So the logic with all\ntautologies as axioms and no rules of inference is distinct from a\nsimilar logic with *modus ponens* as a rule of inference.) The minimal\nrequirements are just that logics are classically based and\nsubstitution-closed.By classically based we mean that their languages\ncontain the Booleanconnectives (or at least some truth-functionally\ncomplete subset thereof) and that these behave classically under the\ndeducibility relation, so that, for example $A \\wedge B \\vdash C$ iff\n$A \\vdash (B \\rightarrow C)$.[^1] If a logic is classical, we may safely\nidentify it with the set of its theorems, knowing that these will\ndetermine the deducibility relation. By substitution-closed we mean that\n$A_1^\\prime,{\\ldots},A_n^\\prime \\vdash B^\\prime$ whenever\n$A_1^\\prime,{\\ldots},A_n^\\prime$ and $B^\\prime$ are the result of\nuniformly replacing sentence letters by formulas in $A_1,{\\ldots},A_n$\nand $B$ such that $A_1,{\\ldots},A_n \\vdash B$. The requirement that the\nlogic is classically based ensures that $A\\vee (B\\wedge p)$ is a logical\nintermediary between $A$ and $B$. The requirement that it is\nsubstitution-closed implies that it is a strict intermediary. For if it\nprovably implied $A$, then its substitution instance $A\\vee (B\\wedge B)$\nwould provably imply $A$, and $A$ would be provably equivalent to $B$.\nAnd if it was provably implied by $B$, then $A\\vee (B\\wedge A)$ would be\nprovably implied by $B$ and again $A$ would be equivalent to $B$. By\nsaying that these logics are the same we mean something close to what is\nsometimes called *translationally equivalent*.[^2] Let us say that\nlogics $L_1$ and $L_2$ are *weakly translationally equivalent* if there\nis a map $s\\colon A{\\mapsto}A^s$ from formulas of $L_1$ to formulas of\n$L_2$ and a map $t\\colon C{\\mapsto}C^t$ from formulas of $L_2$ to\nformulas of $L_1$ satisfying the following conditions (where $\\vdash_i$\nis $\\vdash_{L_i}$ for $i=1,2$):\n\n1.  $A_1,{\\ldots},A_n \\vdash_1 B$ implies\n    ${A_1}\\!^s,{\\ldots},{A_n}\\!^s \\vdash_2 B^s$\n\n2.  $C_1,{\\ldots},C_m \\vdash_2 D$ implies\n    ${C_1}^t,{\\ldots},{C_m}^t \\vdash_1 D^t$\n\n3.  $A ~_1\\!{\\dashv}{\\vdash}\\!_1 (A^s)^t$\n\n4.  $C ~_2\\!{\\dashv}{\\vdash}\\!_2 ~ (C^t)^s$.\n\n$s$ and $t$ are to be thought of as translations between the logics. If\n$L_1$ and $L_2$ are weakly translationally equivalent then the word\n*implies* in i and ii can be strengthened to *if and only if*, so that\n$s$ and $t$ are faithful embeddings. For example, by condition ii,\n${A_1}^s,{\\ldots},{A_n}^s \\vdash_2 B^s$ implies\n$({A_1}^s)^t,{\\ldots},({A_n}^s)^t \\vdash_1({B^s})^t$, and so, by\ncondition iii $A_1,{\\ldots},A_n \\vdash_1 B$. But the strengthened\nversions of i and ii still do not imply iii and iv. (See, for example,\n@French2010 pp 111-124.) $L_1$ and $L_2$ are said to be *translationally\nequivalent* if the translations securing their weak equivalence meet\nsome additional requirement, commonly that they be compositional, i.e.,\nthat they be maps $f$ such that for every n-ary connective $\\#$ in the\nsource language there is formula schema $\\sigma$ of the target language\nwith $n$ schematic variables such that\n$f(\\#A_1{\\ldots}A_n)=\\sigma(f(A_1),{\\ldots},f(A_n))$. If we are\ninterested in what can be said within a logic rather than the structure\nof the formulas saying it, however, the restriction to compositional\ntranslations seems unwarranted. A translation can be \"sentence by\nsentence\" rather than \"symbol by symbol.\" It is plausible to take\nformulas to be saying the same thing in a logic when they are provably\nequivalent. In that case the structure of the things that can be said in\na logic is given by its *Lindenbaum lattice*. By this, we mean the\nstructure $(X,\\le )$ where the members of X are the equivalence classes\n$[A]_L$ of formulas $A$ under the relation $_L\\!{\\dashv}{\\vdash}\\!_L~$\nand $[A]_L\\le [B]_L$ iff $A\\vdash \\!_LB$. In that case, we may say that\ntwo logics are the same with regards to what they can say if their\nLindenbaum lattices are isomorphic. It is not difficult to show that\nunder conditions of interest here, this condition coincides with weak\ntranslational equivalence.\n\n::: {.theorem}\n**Theorem 3**. *(i) If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are weakly translationally\nequivalent then they have isomorphic Lindenbaum lattices. (ii) If $L_1$\nand $L_2$ are classically based and they have isomorphic Lindenbaum\nlattices then they are weakly translationally equivalent.*\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n*Proof.* Here and below, we drop the subscripts from the brackets and\nturnstile symbols, when the logic is intended is clear. To prove i,\nsuppose $s$ and $t$ satisfy conditions i-iv defining weak translational\nequivalence. Let $\\Phi([A])=[A^s]$. We show that $\\Phi$ is an\nisomorphism. i)$\\Phi$ is well defined. Suppose $[A]=[B]$. Then\n$A{\\dashv}{\\vdash}B$. By condition i, this implies\n$A^s{\\dashv}{\\vdash}B^s$. Hence $[A^s] = [B^s]$ and\n$\\Phi([A])=\\Phi([B])$, as required. ii)$\\Phi$ is 1-1. Suppose\n$\\Phi([A])=\\Phi([B])$. Then $[A^s]=[B^s]$ and so\n$A^s{\\dashv}{\\vdash}B^s$. By condition ii,\n$(A^s)^t{\\dashv}{\\vdash}(B^s)^t$. By condition iii,\n$A{\\dashv}{\\vdash}B,$ and so $[A]=[B]$, as required. iii)$\\Phi$ is onto.\nTake any $C$ in the language of $L_2$. By condition iv,\n$C{\\dashv}{\\vdash}(C^t)^s$. Hence $[C] = [(C^t)^s]$. Therefore\n$[C]=\\Phi([C^t])$, and $[C]$ is in the range of $\\Phi$, as required.\n\nThe proof of ii is facilitated by a lemma. Let us say that a translation\n$f\\colon A{\\mapsto}A^f$ *conforms to falsum* if\n$\\bot^f {\\dashv}{\\vdash} \\bot$; *to negation* if\n$(\\neg A)^f {\\dashv}{\\vdash} \\neg A^f$; *to conjunction* if\n$(A\\wedge B)^f {\\dashv}{\\vdash}A^f \\wedge B^f$ and similarly for all the\nother Boolean connectives. To prove part ii of the theorem, we use only\nthat $s$ and $t$ conform to conjunction, but we take the opportunity to\nprove something more general.\n\n::: {.lemma}\n**Lemma 1**. *Suppose $s$ and $t$ are translations securing the weak\nequivalence of classically based modal logics $L_1$ and $L_2$. Then $s$\nand $t$ conform to all the Boolean connectives.*\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n*Proof.* . Suppose $s$ and $t$ satisfy the hypothesis of the lemma. We\nshow that $s$ and $t$ conform to falsum (i) and the conditional (ii) and\nthat it follows that they conform to all the other Boolean connectives\n(iii).\n\n\\(i\\) (We include the subscripts for clarity here.) Since $L_1$ and\n$L_2$ are classically based, $\\bot\\vdash_2 \\bot^s$ and\n$\\bot \\vdash_1 \\bot^t$. From the second of these it follows that\n$\\bot^s \\vdash_2 (\\bot^t)^s$, and therefore that $\\bot^s \\vdash_2 \\bot$.\nHence $\\bot_2\\!{\\dashv}{\\vdash}\\!_2 \\bot^s$ and so $s$ conforms to\n$\\bot$. The proof that $t$ conforms to $\\bot$ is similar.\n\n\\(ii\\) Since $L_1$ is classically based, $(A\\rightarrow B),A \\vdash B$.\nBy condition i of weak translational equivalence\n$(A\\rightarrow B)^s, A^s \\vdash B^s$. Since $L_2$ is classically based,\n$(A\\rightarrow B)^s \\vdash (A^s\\rightarrow B^s)$. Similarly, since $L_2$\nis classically based, $(A\\rightarrow B)^t,A^t \\vdash B^t$. By condition\n(ii) of weak translational equivalence,\n$(A^s\\rightarrow B^s)^t,(A^s)^t \\vdash (B^s)^t$. By condition iii,\n$(A^s)^t {\\dashv}{\\vdash}A$ and $(B^s)^t {\\dashv}{\\vdash}B$, and so\n$(A^s\\rightarrow B^s)^t,A \\vdash B$. Since $L_1$ is classically based,\n$(A^s\\rightarrow B^s)^t \\vdash A\\rightarrow B$. By condition i,\n$((A^s\\rightarrow B^s)^t)^s \\vdash (A\\rightarrow B)^s$, which implies by\ncondition iv that $(A^s\\rightarrow B^s) \\vdash (A\\rightarrow B)^s$. We\nhave now shown that\n$(A\\rightarrow B)^s{\\dashv}{\\vdash}(A^s\\rightarrow B^s)$, and so $s$\nconforms to $\\rightarrow$. The proof that $t$ conforms to $\\rightarrow$\nis similar.\n\n\\(iii\\) It can be shown that $s$ and $t$ conform to each of the\nremaining Boolean connectives by expressing them in terms of falsum and\nthe conditional. For example\n$(\\neg A)^s {\\dashv}{\\vdash} (A\\rightarrow \\bot)^s$. Since $s$ conforms\nto the conditional and falsum,\n$(\\neg A)^s {\\dashv}{\\vdash} A^s \\rightarrow \\bot$. Since the logics are\nclassically based, $(\\neg A)^s {\\dashv}{\\vdash} \\neg A^s$. The other\ncases are similar. ◻\n:::\n\nWe proceed to the proof of part ii of the theorem. Suppose $\\Phi$ is an\nisomorphism between the Lindenbaum lattices $(X_1,\\le _1)$ and\n$(X_2,\\le _2)$ of $L_1$ and $L_2$. Let $s$ map each formula $A$ in the\nlanguage of $L_1$ to any member of $\\Phi([A])$ and let $t$ map each\nformula $C$ in the language of $L_2$ to any member of $\\Phi^{-1}([C])$.\nWe show that $s$ and $t$ meet the four conditions for weak translational\nequivalence. For i, suppose $A_1,{\\ldots},A_n \\vdash B$. Since $L_1$ is\nclassically based $A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge A_n \\vdash B$, and so\n$[A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge A_n] \\le [B]$. Since $\\Phi$ is an\nisomorphism, $\\Phi([A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge A_n]) \\le \\Phi([B])$, and\nso $(A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge A_n)^s \\vdash B^s$. Since $s$ conforms to\nconjunction, $({A_1}^s\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge {A_n}^s) \\vdash B^s$. Since\n$L_2$ is classically based, ${A_1}^s,{\\ldots},{A_n}^s \\vdash B^s$. The\nproof that condition ii is satisfied is similar. For conditions iii and\niv note that, since $A^s \\in \\Phi([A]), [A^s]= \\Phi([A])$. Similarly,\n$[C^t]= \\Phi^{-1}([C^t])$. Together these two identities imply\n$[(A^s)^t] = \\Phi^{-1}(\\Phi([A])$ and $[(C^t)^s]= \\Phi(\\Phi^{-1}[C])$.\nIt follows that $[(A^s)^t] = [A]$ and $[(C^t)^s]=[C]$ and therefore that\nconditions iii and iv are satisfied. ◻\n:::\n\nSince the modal logics under consideration are classically based, their\nLindenbaum lattices are Boolean algebras, i.e., we can define from $\\le$\noperations $\\wedge$,$\\vee$, and $\\neg$ satisfying the usual Boolean\naxioms. Humberstone's observation that these logics provide strict\nintermediaries implies that they are dense. Using $X{<}Y$ to mean\n$X\\le Y$ and not $Y\\le X$, we have that $[A]{<}[B]$ implies that there\nis some element $[I]$ such that $[A]{<}[I]{<}[B]$. But a Boolean algebra\nis dense iff it is atomless. (If the algebra is dense and $0{<}X$ then\nthere is is an element $I$, that precedes $X$, in the sense that\n$0{<}I{<}X$, so $X$ cannot be an atom. Conversely if the algebra has no\natoms, then there is an intermediary $I$ between $0$ and $X$, so if\n$X{<}Y$, $X\\vee (I\\wedge Y)$ is an intermediary between $X$ and $Y$.) A\nbasic theorem of Boolean algebra states that the theory of atomless\nBoolean algebras is $\\aleph_0$-categorical, i.e., that any two countable\natomless Boolean algebras are isomorphic.It follows that any two\nreasonably well-behaved modal logics are weakly translationally\nequivalent. There is a sense in which adding $\\Box$ or any other\nnon-Boolean connectives to the language of propositional logic and\naxioms and rules of derivation to the usual rules for classical logic\nadds nothing to what can be said. This observation contrasts starkly\nwith what happens when translations are required to be compositional. In\n@PelletierAndUrquhart, it is shown that if well-behaved modal logics\n$L_1$ and $L_2$ are are translationally equivalent, then, for any number\n$n$, the number of Kripke frames with $n$ worlds validating $L_1$ is the\nsame as the number validating $L_2$. It follows if two logics have the\nfinite frame property (as all the most familiar modal logics do) and one\nis a sublogic of the other, they cannot be translationally equivalent.\nThe observation here demonstrates the importance for the\nPelletier/Urquhart result of the requirement that the translations be\ncompositional.\n\nWe do know that the translations between classically based modal logics\nconform to the Boolean connectives. This allows us to sharpen the result\nslightly in the direction of Pelletier/Urquhart.\n\n::: {.theorem}\n**Theorem 4**. *Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are classically based modal\nlogics. Then $L_1$ and $L_2$ are weakly translationally equivalent by\nway of translations $s^*$ and $t^*$ that preserve the Boolean\nconnectives.*\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n*Proof.* Since the logics are classically based they have isomorphic\nLindenbaum lattices. By the previous theorem they are weakly\ntranslationally equivalent. Let $s$ and $t$ be the translations securing\nthis similarity. We define $s^*$ and $t^*$ by cases:\n\n1.  $s^*(A)=A^s$ if $A$ is a sentence letter or $A = {\\#}A_1{\\ldots}A_n$\n    for ${\\#}$ an $n$-ary non-Boolean connective\n\n2.  $s^{*}(\\bot)=\\bot$\n\n3.  $s^{*}(\\neg A)= \\neg A^{s^{*}}$\n\n4.  $s^{*}(A{\\#}B) = A^{s^{*}}\\!{\\#} B^{s^{*}}$ if ${\\#}$ is\n    $\\wedge ,\\vee ,\\rightarrow$ or $\\leftrightarrow$.\n\nThe clauses for $t^*$ are similar.\n\nInduction using sentence letters and formulas ${\\#}A_1{\\ldots}A_n$ for\n${\\#}$ non-Boolean as a base and appeal to the conformity property\nestablishes that $s^*\\!(A){\\dashv}{\\vdash}A^s$ and\n$t^*(C){\\dashv}{\\vdash}C^t$. It follows that $s^*$ and $t^*$, which\npreserve the Boolean connectives, also satisfy the conditions for weak\ntranslational equivalence. ◻\n:::\n\nNote, however, that the result of @PelletierAndUrquhart ensures that\n$s^*$ and $t^*$ are not in general compositional. So one should not\npresume, for example, that the $s^*$-translation of $\\Box (p\\wedge q)$\nis any function of the $s^*$ translations of $p$ and $q$.\n\n### S4 $\\oplus$ 5$^\\prime$ = S4$\\oplus$F\n\nConsider the following two axioms:\n\n-   **5**$^\\prime$:\n    $(p \\wedge \\neg \\Box p \\wedge \\Box (p \\vee \\Box (p \\rightarrow \\Box p))) \\rightarrow \\Box \\neg \\Box p$\n\n-   **F**:\n    $(p\\wedge \\Diamond\\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box (\\Diamond p\\vee q)$\n\nThese emerge in Humberstone's survey (402-420) of the logical terrain\nbetween **S4** and **S5** for plausible epistemic logics. **F** figures\nprominently in @Stalnaker2006-STAOLO and **5**$^\\prime$ in @Voorbraak.1991.\nHumberstone (410) asks whether it is possible to derive **F** from\n**S4** and **5**$^\\prime$. The point of this section is to argue that it\nis. We'll also show something that is already clear in Humberstone's\ntext, which is that **5**$^\\prime$ can be proven in **S4F**, so **S4F**\n= **S45**$^\\prime$. Humberstone in fact shows something considerably\nstronger, namely that **S4F** is complete with respect to the class of\ntransitive, reflexive, semi-Euclidean frames, and **5**$^\\prime$ is\nsound with respect to the class of those frames. (The semi-Euclidean\nframes are those which satisfy\n$\\forall xyz((xRy \\wedge xRz) \\rightarrow (yRz \\vee zRx))$. The term\n*semi-Euclidean* is taken from @Voorbraak.1991.) From these results it\nfollows there must be some proof of **5**$^\\prime$ in **S4F**. But the\nstatus of **F** in **S45**$^\\prime$ was an open question.\n\nIt will be convenient to label three additional formulas that appear in\nthe course of our derivation of F:\n\n-   **5**$^{\\prime\\prime}\\!: (p \\wedge \\Diamond\\neg p \\wedge \\Diamond\\Box p) \\rightarrow \\Diamond(\\neg p \\wedge \\Diamond(p\\wedge \\neg \\Box p))$\n\n-   **A**:\n    $(\\Diamond{p}\\vee \\Box q) \\wedge \\Diamond\\neg (\\Diamond{p}\\vee \\Box q) \\wedge \\Diamond\\Box (\\Diamond{p}\\vee \\Box q)$\n\n-   **B**:\n    $\\neg (\\Diamond{p}\\vee \\Box q) \\wedge \\Diamond((\\Diamond{p}\\vee \\Box q) \\wedge \\neg \\Box (\\Diamond{p}\\vee \\Box q))$\n\nWe will show the following:\n\n::: {.theorem}\n**Theorem 5**.\n:::\n\n> 1.  **5**$^{\\prime}~_{\\text{K}}\\!{\\dashv}{\\vdash}_\\text{K}~\\textbf{5}^{\\prime\\prime}$\n>\n> 2.  $\\vdash_\\text{KT4} ~ \\neg \\textbf{F}\\rightarrow \\textbf{A}$\n>\n> 3.  $\\vdash_{\\text{5}^{\\prime\\prime}} ~\\textbf{A}\\rightarrow \\Diamond\\textbf{B}$\n>\n> 4.  $\\vdash_\\text{S4} ~\\neg \\Diamond\\textbf{B}$\n\ni allows us to work within **S45**$^{\\prime\\prime}$ rather than\n**S45**$^\\prime$, and ii, iii, iv constitute a *reductio* proof of **F**\nwithin that system. It should be noted that Humberstone uses\n**5**$^\\prime$ as a label for the schema corresponding to the axiom\ngiven here.

Models are triples\n$\\langle U,f,V\\rangle$ where $U$ and $V$ are sets and valuations of the\nkind familiar from modal logic and $f$ is a unary function from $U$ to\n$U$. The truth definition has the usual clauses for the classical\nconnectives and the additional clause:\n\n-    $\\langle U,f,V\\rangle  \\models _x \\mathbf{D}A$ iff\n    $\\langle U,f,V\\!\\rangle  \\models _x A$ and not\n    $\\langle U,f,V\\!\\rangle \\models _{f(x)} A$.\n\nTruth in the model is truth at all $u{\\in}U$, and validity is is truth\nin all models. Among the valid schemas and validity-preserving rules\nthat he draws attention to are the following:\n\n-   D0: Substitution instances of tautologies\n\n-   D1: $\\mathbf{D}A\\rightarrow A$\n\n-   D2: $(A\\wedge\\mathbf{D}B) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B)$\n\n-   D3:\n    $\\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}A\\vee \\mathbf{D}B)$\n\n-   MP: $A\\rightarrow B, A ~~/~~ B$\n\n-   RD$_{m,n}$:\n    $(B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m) \\rightarrow (A_1\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee A_n) ~~/ \\\\$$(B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m) \\rightarrow ((\\mathbf{D}A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge \\mathbf{D}A_n) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}B_1 \\vee {\\ldots}\\vee \\mathbf{D}B_m))$\n\nThe last rule schema is intended to include the cases $m=0$ and $n=0$\nwith the usual stipulation that an empty conjunction is $\\top$ and an\nempty disjunction is $\\bot$. The reader is asked to show that D2 and D3\nare provable from the remaining schemas as an exercise and the valid\nformulas are then shown to be axiomatized by D0, D1, MP and all the RD\nrules. In this section we consider two additional schemas.\n\n-   D4:\n    $(\\mathbf{D}A\\wedge \\mathbf{D}B) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\vee B)$\n\n-   D5:$\\neg \\mathbf{D}\\top$\n\nWe show that the valid formulas of coming-about logic are axiomatized by\nD0, D1, D3, D4, D5 MP and RD$_{1,1}$. Since we can always add a rule of\nsubstitution while replacing the schematic variables in D1, D3, D4 by\nsentence letters and replacing D0 by a finite set of axioms for\nsentential logic, this shows that Humberstone's infinite axiomatization\ncan be replaced by a simple finite one.\n\nD4 plays a special role among the axioms and rules considered. Suppose\n$\\mathbf{D}{A}$ is interpreted as *it is contingently true that* $A$\n(or, as the section head suggests, that $A$, while true, is not\nnecessarily so). More precisely, replace the function $f$ in\nHumberstone's models by an accessibility of the usual kind and his truth\nclause for $\\mathbf{D}$ by the following:\n\n-    CT: $\\langle U,R,V\\!\\rangle  \\models _x \\mathbf{D}A$ iff\n    $\\langle U,R,V\\!\\rangle  \\models _x A$ and, for some $y$ such that\n    $xRy$, not $\\langle U,R,V\\!\\rangle \\models _y A$\n\nIt is easy to check that D0, D1, D2, D3 and D5 all remain valid and MP\nand RD$_{1,1}$ still preserve validity. But when $R$ is not a function\nthen D4 can be falsified: Let\n$U=\\{w,u,v\\}, R=\\{(w,u),(w,v)\\}, V(p)=\\{w,u\\}$ and $V(q)=\\{w,v\\}$. So D4\nis independent of the five axioms and two rules just given. In fact, as\nwe shall show, these axioms and rules are sufficient to axiomatize the\n*contingently true* operator under the interpretation CT.\n\nFirst, however, we turn to the connection between the formula schemas\nand the rule schema RD$_{m,n}$ and the proof that the logic of coming\nabout is finitely axiomatizable. Note that any logic containing D0 and\nclosed under MP is closed under truth-functional consequence (TFC). This\nfacilitates the proof of the following:\n\n::: {.claim}\n**Claim 1**. *In the presence of D0, D1 and MP: D2 is provable from\nRD$_{1,1}$, D3 is provable from RD$_{2,1}$, D4 is provable from\nRD$_{1,2}$ and D5 is provable from RD$_{0,1}$*\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n*Proof.* The required derivations are sketched below.\n\n1.  $(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow B$ by D0\n\n2.  $(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}B\\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B))$from\n    1 by RD$_{1,1}$\n\n3.  $(A\\wedge B\\wedge \\mathbf{D}B)\\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B))$from\n    2 by TFC\n\n4.  $(A\\wedge \\mathbf{D}B)\\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B))$from 3 and\n    D1 by TFC\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n1.  $(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow (A\\wedge B)$ by D0\n\n2.  $(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}A\\vee \\mathbf{D}B))$from\n    1 by RD$_{2,1}$\n\n3.  $\\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}A\\vee \\mathbf{D}B)$from\n    2 and D1 by TFC\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n1.  $(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow (A\\vee B)$ by D0\n\n2.  $(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow ((\\mathbf{D}A\\wedge \\mathbf{D}B)\\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\vee B))$\n    from 1 by RD$_{1,2}$\n\n3.  $\\mathbf{D}(A\\wedge B)\\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A\\vee B)$from 2 and D1\n    by TFC\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n1.  $\\top \\rightarrow \\top$by D0\n\n2.  $\\top \\rightarrow (D\\top \\rightarrow \\bot)$from 1 by RD$_{0,1}$\n\n3.  $\\neg D\\top$from 2 by TFC\n\n ◻\n:::\n\nSince Humberstone has already shown that D0 and D1 are valid and that\nmodus ponens and every instance of RD$_{m,n}$ preserves validity, the\nclaim is sufficient to show that our new axiom system is sound. To prove\nsufficiency, it is sufficient to show that, for all $m,n\\!\\ge\\!0$,\nRD$_{m,n}$ is derivable in the new system. To this end, notice first\nthat D3 and D4 generalize, i.e., if $\\vdash$ indicates provability in\nthe new axiom system then:\n\n-   D3\\*: For all\n    $n{\\ge}1, \\vdash \\mathbf{D}(A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge A_n) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}A_1\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee \\mathbf{D}A_n)$,\n    and\n\n-   D4\\*: For all\n    $n{\\ge}1, \\vdash (\\mathbf{D}A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge \\mathbf{D}A_n) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(A_1\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee A_n)$.\n\nFor these claims to be sensible without grouping conjuncts and disjuncts\nour logic must allow replacement of truth-functional equivalents.\nHumberstone's proof (453) of the claim that his logic satisfies the\nstronger property of being \"congruential,\" i.e., closed under\nreplacement of provable equivalents uses only D0 and RD$_{1,1}$ so we\ncan help ourselves to this result. The claims can then be proved by\ninduction on $n$. In each case the basis case follows from D0. The\ninductive step for D3\\* uses D3 and that for D4\\* uses D4.\n\nThis allows us to show that RD$_{m,n}$ is derivable for all positive $m$\nand $n$: Suppose\n$\\vdash (B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m) \\rightarrow (A_1\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee A_n)$.\nThen by RD$_{1,1}$,\\\n$\\vdash (B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}(A_1\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee A_n) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{D}(B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m))$.\nBy D3\\* and TFC,\n$\\vdash (B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}(A_1\\vee {\\ldots}\\vee An) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}B_1 \\vee {\\ldots}\\vee \\mathbf{D}B_m))$.\nBy D4\\* and TFC,\n$\\vdash (B_1 \\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m) \\rightarrow ((\\mathbf{D}A_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge \\mathbf{D}An) \\rightarrow (\\mathbf{D}B_1 \\vee {\\ldots}\\vee \\mathbf{D}B_m))$.\n\nIt remains only to check the cases $m{=}0$ and $n{=}0$. But for all $m$,\nRD$_{m,0}$ is a consequence of TFC: if\n$(B_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m)\\rightarrow \\bot$ is provable then so is\nany formula with $B_1\\wedge {\\ldots}\\wedge B_m$ as antecedent, including\nthe consequence of RD$_{m,0}$.\n\nFor the case $m=0$ we will need D4\\* and D5.
