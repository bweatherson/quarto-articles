That the truth of a sentence is relative to a context of utterance is uncontroversial in contemporary semantics. This chapter focuses on three points: whether the version of contextualism is vulnerable to the disagreement and retraction arguments, and if so, whether these problems can be avoided by a more sophisticated contextualist theory. The points include: whether relativism really does avoid the four problems posed for the other theories; and whether there are other theories that also avoid the problems, without running into the problems facing relativism or problems of their own. The chapter concentrates on two families of views that have been called relativist: Relativism about propositional truth; and Relativism about utterance truth.\ndate: April 24 2017\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\n  - name: Patrick Shirreff\n    url: https://patrickshirreff.wixsite.com/home\n    affiliation: University of Tartu\n    affiliation_url: https://www.flfi.ut.ee/en/department-philosophy\ndoi: \"10.1002/9781118972090.ch30\"\ncategories:\n  - language\n  - relativism\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118972090.ch30\nself-contained: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\npreview: tasty.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 4\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\nRelativism, in the sense we're interested in here, is the view that the\ntruth of a sentence is relative both to a context of utterance and a\ncontext of assessment. That the truth of a sentence is relative to a\ncontext of utterance is uncontroversial in contemporary semantics. If\nthe authors of this paper were to both utter the sentence \"I'm\nCanadian\", then one of us would say something true, and the other\nsomething false. And that's because the truth of the utterance \"I'm\nCanadian\" is sensitive to a feature of the context of utterance, namely\nthe identity of the speaker. And that in turn is explained by the fact\nthat the proposition expressed by that sentence is different in\ndifferent contexts. Relativists deny that this simple story can explain\nall the ways in which context language.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Blackwell Companion to the Philosophy of Language_, edited by Bob Hale, Crispin Wright and Alexander Miller, 787-803.\n\nPicture by [Lon&Queta](https://www.flickr.com/photos/48096653@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/0c877aee-2e6e-49f1-b5be-b5bef1f7ceb2).\n</aside>\n\nA core motivation for relativism comes from looking at the problems with\nother views. So let's start by thinking about what might be happening\nwhen a speaker says \"This is tasty\". (Call this utterance, which we'll\ncome back to a bit, U, and its speaker S.) The demonstrative 'this' is\ncontext-sensitive, but let's assume it is clear what is being referred\nto, and think about what contribution the predicate is making. There are\ntwo natural proposals that are simple, easy to fit into familiar\nframeworks, and most likely wrong.\n\nFirst, the predicate might pick out an objective property of tastiness,\nand when S utters U, she ascribes this property to a thing. This\nobjective view has a number of problems. First, there is a metaphysical\nproblem; just what is this objective tastiness? Second, there is an\nepistemological problem. Typically, a speaker like S could be prepared\nto utter U after taking one bite of the thing. But for most plausible\nanswers to the first question, it is unclear how they could know that\nthe object had that property. The two problems reinforce each other; The\nmore plausible answers to the metaphysical question make the property\nsensitive to very abtruse conditions, such as how idealised observers\nwould react to ingesting the substance. But that makes it even more\nunlikely that typical utterances of U satisfy the epistemological\nrequirement. (The points we're making here are well known, but our\npresentation owes a lot to @Lasersohn2005.)\n\nSecond, the predicate might be context-sensitive. For concreteness,\nlet's focus on a very simple contextualist theory of 'tasty'. An\nutterance of U is true, relative to a context $c$, iff the speaker in\n$c$ likes the taste of the referent of 'this' in $c$. So \"This is tasty\"\nand \"I like the taste of this\" express something very close to the same\nproposition. (At least they express propositions that are necessarily\nmaterially equivalent, but the relation between the two is probably\ncloser than that.) Again there are two problems, both of them to do with\nthe different dynamics of \"This is tasty\" and \"I like the taste of\nthis\". A hearer H, who does not like the taste of this substance, could\nmore readily disagree with \"This is tasty\" than with \"I like the taste\nof this\". If H doesn't like its taste, he'll nevertheless concede that\nS's utterance of \"I like the taste of this\" is true, but won't concede\nthat \"This is tasty\" is true. And a similar phenomenon occurs when S\nherself changes her mind. If later she dislikes the taste of the\nsubstance, she will be disposed to retract her utterance of \"This is\ntasty\", but not of \"I like the taste of this\". So both disagreement and\nretraction data pose problems for the contextualist. (On disagreement,\nsee especially Tamina @Stephenson2007. On retraction, and most\neverything else we'll talk about in this paper, see John\n@MacFarlane2014.)\n\nIf the objectivist and contextualist solutions fail, the relativist\nsuggests that they have a useful alternative. Say that truth is doubly\nrelativised, both to contexts of utterance and to context of assessment.\nSo the utterance, or perhaps just the proposition expressed by it, is\ntrue relative to a context of assessment $c_a$ and context of utterance\n$c_u$ iff the agent at $c_a$ likes the taste of the denotation of 'this'\nin $c_u$. So now the truth of the utterance is relative both to the\ncontext of utterance and the context of assessment. This solves the\nmetaphysical problem; talk about what a person likes is unproblematic.\nIt solves at least a version of the epistemological problem; a speaker\nknows what they like, so can make utterances that are true in their\ncontext. It solves a version of the disagreement problem; if H doesn't\nlike the taste of the stuff, he can truly say that what S said is not\ntrue, since it isn't true in his context. And it explains the retraction\ndata, since once S changes her taste, what she said is no longer true\nrelative to her new context, and hence should be retracted.\n\nAs everywhere else in philosophy, arguments and claims can be and are\ncontested. In the quick case for relativism we've described so far,\nthere are at least four points where one could readily disagree.\n\n1.  Whether objectivism is really vulnerable to the combination of the\n    metaphysical and the epistemological arguments.\n\n2.  Whether this version of contextualism is vulnerable to the\n    disagreement and retraction arguments, and if so, whether these\n    problems can be avoided by a more sophisticated contextualist\n    theory.\n\n3.  Whether relativism really does avoid the four problems posed for the\n    other theories.\n\n4.  Whether there are other theories that also avoid the problems,\n    without running into the problems facing relativism or problems of\n    their own.\n\nIn this entry, we'll focus on the last three points, since they are more\nwidely discussed in the literature than the first one. And indeed, the\nlast three points are extremely actively debated in recent years. We\nwon't try to take sides in those debates, though we will note that on no\npoint is the final picture nearly as rosy for the relativist as this\ninitial sketch may suggest.\n\nWe've so far focussed on one particular predicate, 'tasty', though the\npoints we've been making generalise to most predicates of personal\ntaste. But this is far from the only area where relativist theories have\nbeen proposed. There has been a lot of discussion of relativist theories\nof epistemic modals. The arguments here are fairly similar to the\narguments about predicates of personal taste (though see the discussion\nbelow about syntax and control). And MacFarlane has argued for\nrelativist treatments of future contingents, and knowledge ascriptions.\nWe will not spend much time on those constructions explicitly, but the\nissues they raise are broadly similar to the issues raised by predicates\nof personal taste, and by epistemic modals.\n\nWe will largely bypass two quite different areas where relativist\ntheories have been proposed. Mark @Richard2008 has argued for a\nrelativist treatment of comparative adjectives. And\n@Weatherson2011-NoRoyal arguedfor relativist treatments of areas of\ncertain areas discourse where common assumptions about the area are\nfalse, and a relativist treatment might be the most charitable fix. As\ninteresting as we find these proposals, they haven't occasioned nearly\nas much discussion as the proposals discussed above, and so we'll set\nthem aside.\n\nWhat we will do is first clarify some of the many ways in which the term\n'relativism' has been used in recent debates, then review some technical\nmaterial about indices and contexts that is essential for understanding\nsome relativist views, then look at the main line of recent debate\nconcerning relativism, the one centered on issues about retraction and\ndisagreement, and finally look at some syntactic evidence for\nrelativism.\n\n### Varieties of Relativism {#varietiesofrelativism}\n\nAs we noted in the very first paragraph, it is uncontroversial that\nsentence truth is sensitive to the context of utterance. It is extremely\ncontentious just how many such sentences are sensitive to the context of\nutterance. (See, for instance [@DeRose2009;\n@HarmanThomson1996; @Cappelen2005] for some of the disputes.) But that\nthere is some sensitivity here is uncontroversial. The view that a\nsentence type's truth is sensitive to its context of utterance is\nsometimes called \"indexical relativism\" [@Kolbel2004a; @Einheuser2008].\nFor some purposes this is a useful name. In particular, the view that\nthe content of moral predicates, and hence the truth value of\nascriptions of moral predicates, is sensitive to the context of\nutterance does seem like a form of moral relativism, as that term is\nstandardly understood. It is, for instance, the view that @Harman1975\ndefends in a self-proclaimed defence of moral relativism. (That this was\ntraditionally known as relativism is stressed in @CappelenHuvenes2014,\nwho draw some interesting conclusions from this fact.) But for present\npurposes we want to clearly exclude those views, and focus on much more\nradical proposals that have been recently made.\n\nThere are two (overlapping) families of views that have been called\nrelativist, and which we will be concentrating on for the bulk of this\nentry. They are:\n\n-   Relativism about propositional truth - Whether a proposition is true\n    is not an absolute fact. Propositions can be true relative to some\n    contexts of assessment, and false relative to others.\n\n-   Relativism about utterance truth - Whether an utterance is true is\n    not an absolute fact. Utterances can be true relatve to some\n    contexts of assessment, and false relative to others.\n\nIt isn't always clear whether a particular author, in defending\nrelativism, is primarily defending the first or second of these claims.\nBut it is natural to interpret most relativists as defending relativism\nabout propositional truth. This is most clearly true for @Kolbel2002 and\n@Egan2007-EGAEMR, but there are few relativists that it is hard to\ninterpret as taking this to be the primary focus. The one big exception,\nhowever, is the most prominent defender of relativism in the\ncontemporary literature, John @MacFarlane2014. He takes relativism about\nutterance truth to be the only genuine form of relativism, though he\nalso endorses relativism about propositional truth. We are not going to\nengage with the dispute over what is *really* a relativist view. Instead\nwe'll just describe a pair of views that are relativist in one of these\nsenses but not the other, to explain how the two senses come apart.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to make propositional truth, but not\nutterance truth, relative. Assume that Suzy actually swims, but that she\nmight not have. Then, on a natural way of thinking about modality, the\nproposition *Suzy swims* will be true relative to the actual world, but\nfalse relative to any possible world in which she does not. So\npropositional truth is relative, with the relativity being to possible\nworlds.\n\n@CappelenHawthorne2009 argue that the reasoning of the previous\nparagraph misunderstands the nature of truth and modality. The\nproposition *Suzy swims* is, they say, simply true. It might have been\nfalse. But that doesn't mean it is merely true relative to some world or\nother; it just means that it might have had a different property than it\nactually has. @Schaffer2012 argues that the things we say and think,\ni.e., propositions, typically have worlds in their content, so what we\nexpress by the sentence \"Suzy swims\" is the proposition *Suzy swims at\n@*, and that proposition, like all propositions, has a non-relative\ntruth value.\n\nEven if all that is wrong, and the contents of sentences like \"Suzy\nswims\" are propositions that are true in some worlds, false in others,\nthere is a reason not to call this 'relativism'. After all, other worlds\ndon't exist, or at least don't exist in the way ours does. So it isn't\ntrue that the proposition expressed by \"Suzy swims\" is true relative to\nsomething and false relative to something else; there isn't a something\nelse for it to be false relative to.\n\nTaking the last point on board, a serious relativism about propositional\ntruth should say that there is a proposition *p*, and two relata *a* and\n*b* such that *p* is true relative to *a*, and false relative to *b*.\nOne way to do that, as seen in for example @Kaplan1977, is to make truth\nrelative to times, and believe that other times exist. (The contrast\nhere is with the eternalist view of propositions defended by\n@Evans1985.) But the radical view that has been central to many recent\nversions of relativism has been to say that truth is relative to world,\ntime, individual triples. So there is a proposition, for example, that\nis true relative to a triple $\\langle w, t, a \\rangle$ iff in $w$, the\nindividual $a$ disapproves of murder at $t$. Perhaps, on a relativist\nframework, this just is the proposition that murder is wrong. The\npicture of propositions here owes something to the discussion of de se\nbeliefs in @Lewis1979b, since Lewis thought the contents of such beliefs\nwere sets of such triples. But Lewis put this forward as a theory about\nmental content; the move to extending it to linguistic content is more\nrecent.\n\nOn this view, the contents of utterances will be propositions that can\nbe true relative to one individual (in a world, at a time) and false\nrelative to another. But the utterances themselves will naturally be\nthought to have absolute truth value. Think back to the view that\npropositional truth is just relative to worlds. Then an utterance of\n\"Suzy swims\" will, intuitively, be true iff Suzy swims in the world the\nutterance is made. When we think about a counterfactual utterance of\n\"Suzy swims\" in a world where she does not, we don't think the utterance\nis true just because its content is actually true. So although this is a\nform of relativism about propositional truth, it is not yet a form of\nrelativism about utterance truth. MacFarlane, who takes utterance\nrelativism to be central, calls this view 'non-indexical contextualism',\nwith the name meant to highlight that it isn't, by his lights, genuinely\nrelativist.\n\nNow turn to relativism about utterance truth. A simple way to implement\nthis is to say that the propositional content of an utterance is\nrelative to an assessor. So consider a very simple, and surely false,\nview about 'you' in English. It holds that the content of an utterance\nof 'you', relative to a context of assessment, is the agent of that\ncontext. And it says that the utterance is true at a context of\nassessment iff the proposition it expresses relative to that context is\n(absolutely) true. So an utterance of \"You swim\" will express a\ndifferent proposition relative to contexts with different agents. And\nsince some of those propositions will be true, and some false, we have a\nversion of relativism about utterance truth. But this view is consistent\nwith the view that propositional truth is absolute, not relative even to\nworlds.\n\nSo the two versions of relativism are dissociable. But it is also\npossible to hold them simultaneously, as @MacFarlane2014 does. To set up\nMacFarlane's view, it is helpful to review the framework against which\nit was developed.\n\n### Index, Context and Content {#indexcontextandcontent}\n\nThe existence of indexical terms, like 'I', means that we can't give a\ntheory for truth conditions of sentences as such. The sentence-type *I\nam in Ann Arbor now* doesn't have truth conditions; only occurrences of\nthis sentence do. So a natural move is to build up a theory that assigns\nto each term a function from contexts to contents, and use that to\nprovide a theory of which contexts a sentence is true in. It turns out\nthat there are reasons to endorse more complications than this. In\nparticular, sentences like (1) show the need for relativising truth\nconditions relative to both a context and an *index*.\n\n> \\(1\\) It might have been the case that my actual parents never met\n\nThat's true. But think of how we might naturally provide truth\nconditions for it. First, we define the context-relative truth\nconditions for \"My actual parents never met.\". The context will provide\na world for 'actually' (i.e., the actual world), and an agent for 'my'\n(i.e., the speaker). Then, we say that the modal operator shifts the\nworld of evaluation. Intuitively, *Might p* is true iff *p* is true in\nsome possible world. So we need some way to see if the content of \"My\nactual parents never met\" is true in some other world. But that's hard\nto do, since (given origin essentialism), there will be no context in\nwhich \"My actual parents never met\" can be truly uttered, so its content\nwill be the function that maps every context into FALSE. And that's the\nsame content as, for example, \"Two plus two is five\", and so it can't be\npossibly true.\n\nThere are actually two related problems here. One is that while we need\nto look around the other worlds to see whether some thing is true, the\nnature of that thing is fixed by the actual context. So if the sentence\nis uttered by Sasha Obama in this world, the content is something like\n*It might have been the case that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama never\nmet*. We need to fix the values of the contextually sensitive terms\n('my' and 'actual') even when they appear inside operators. The second\nproblem is that something as coarse-grained as a function is very hard\nto 'shift' in just one respect.\n\nThere is a well-known solution to this, developed primarily by Hans\n@Kamp1971, then put to important philosophical use by David @Lewis1980b\nand David @Kaplan1977. Say that our semantic theory will assign a\nfunction from both contexts and indices to terms. Ultimately, each\nsentence will get as its semantic value a function from contexts and\nindices to truth values. Lewis describes the distinction between\ncontexts and indices thus,\n\n> A context is a location -- time, place, and possible world -- where a\n> sentence is said. It has countless features, determined by the\n> character of the location. An index is an n-tuple of features of\n> context, but not necessarily features that go together in any possible\n> context. Thus an index might consist of a speaker, a time before his\n> birth, a worlds where he never lived at all, and so on.  [@Lewis1980b\n> 79]\n\nindices are structured, and so they can be 'improper'; it might consist\nof things that don't go together. If the index contains just worlds and\nindividuals, the index could be $\\langle w,$ Sasha Obama$\\rangle$, even\nif Sasha doesn't exist in $w$. Such an index will play a central role in\nmaking (1), as uttered by Sasha Obama, true. A context, on the other\nhand, will by its nature be proper; it will pick out a world, and a time\nin that world, and a person existing at that time, and so on.\n\nIndices are, unlike contexts, 'shiftable'. There can be sentential\noperators that say the truth value of the whole sentence is given by\nlooking at the truth value of the embedded sentence at some different\nindex. Assume, for example, that there is a world parameter in the\nindex, so the index is $\\langle w, x\\rangle$, where $x$ contains\neverything else in the index. Then *Might p* will be true relative to\ncontext $c$ and index $\\langle w, x\\rangle$ just in case for some\n$w^{\\prime}$, *p* is true relative to context $c$ and index\n$\\langle w^{\\prime}, x\\rangle$. Note that in this definition, we do\n*not* shift $c$; so if $c$ determines that the referent of 'I' is Sasha\nObama, that stays even if we 'shift' the index to a world where Sasha\ndoes not exist.\n\nThe separation between context and index was developed to solve some\ntechnical problems, but it can do some philosophical work. The theory\nassociates each sentence with a function from contexts and indices to\ntruth values. Equivalently, it associates sentence-context pairs with\nfunctions from indices to truth values. So it is natural to say that the\ncontent of an utterance is (or is at least intimately connected to) the\nfunction associated with the pair consisting of the sentence uttered and\nthe context it was uttered in. If the index is simply a world, then the\ncontents will be functions from worlds to truth-values, as defended by\nclassical contextualists such as Robert @Stalnaker1984. David\n@Lewis1980b objected that assigning contents at just this stage was\narbitrary, why not associate contents with functions from context to\ntruth values instead? François @Recanati2007 responds well to Lewis's\narguments, although his defence requires making indices much more\ncomplex. In particular, he includes parameters for times and individuals\nin the index, leading him to support relativism about propositional\ntruth.\n\nWith this background, we can more easily describe two distinctive\nfeatures of MacFarlane's views. First, he makes indices very complicated\nindeed. The index might include, among other things, an information set\n(for interpreting epistemic and deontic modals), a standard of taste\n(for interpreting predicates of personal taste), relevant alternatives\n(for interpreting knowledge ascriptions), a time (for handling future\ncontingents), and perhaps many more things. For simplicity, we'll call\nthese things collectively a *perspective*, and say that indices are\nworld-perspective pairs. (Though note that our terminology here requires\nperspectives to be structured entities, and for them to be potentially\nimproper.) If the propositional content of an utterance is (intimately\nconnected to) a function from indices to truth-values, then the one\nproposition will be true relative to one perspective and false relative\nto another.\n\nSo far we only have relativism about propositional truth, or what\nMacFarlane calls non-indexical contextualism. MacFarlane argues for a\nsecond revision to contextualist orthodoxy. Assume that we have a\nparticular utterance $U$ of a sentence $S$ in context of utterance\n$c_u$, and that utterance is being assessed in context $c_a$. And assume\nthat $w(c)$ is the world of context $c$, and $p(c)$ is the perspective\nof context $c$. Sentence $S$ is associated with a function $f_S$ from\ncontext-index pairs, i.e., context-world-perspective triples, to truth\nvalues. The relativist about propositional truth, but not utterance\ntruth, says that $U$ is true iff $f_S(c_u, w(c_u), p(c_u)) = TRUE$.\nMacFarlane's relativist[^1] says that $U$ is true iff\n$f_S(c_u, w(c_u), p(c_a)) = TRUE$. Crucially, we assess the utterance\nitself, and not just its content, by the perspective of the assessor.\nMacFarlane argues that this move allows a better understanding of\ndisagreement and retraction, which were central to the phenomena that\nmotivated relativism. So let's turn to how well relativism explains the\nphenomena it was designed to explain.\n\n### Retraction and Disagreement {#retractionanddisagreement}\n\n#### Retraction\n\nContextualists have a difficult time explaining why we retract earlier\nclaims involving predicates of personal taste or epistemically modals\nassertions when our perspective has changed in the intervening time.\nConsider this example:\n\n> Kim (age 8): Lunchables are delicious.\\\n> Kim (age 26 being reminded of previous assertion): I take it back/I\n> was wrong/what I said was false. Lunchables aren't delicious.\n\nWhen Kim retracts her earlier assertion, it is natural to use any of the\nthree forms of retraction listed here. It isn't natural to say either of\nthe following things:\n\n-   Lunchables were delicious back then, but they aren't delicious any\n    more.\n\n-   When I said that back then, I only meant that they were delicious to\n    me back then.\n\nThere is a contrast with how clearly context sensitive terms like 'here'\nare used. It isn't natural to use any of the three forms of retraction\nwe attribute to Kim below.\n\n> Kim (in a café): It is pleasant here.\\\n> Kim (in an oil refinery, reminded of previous assertion) I take it\n> back/I was wrong/What I said was false. It isn't pleasant here.\n\nOn the other hand, it is natural to say things like:\n\n-   It was pleasant where we were, but it isn't pleasant where we are\n    now.\n\n-   When I said that back then, I only meant it was pleasant where we\n    were.\n\nPredicates of personal taste, like 'delicious', don't behave like\nexplicitly context-sensitive expressions like 'pleasant here'. We see\nthe same pattern with epistemic modals.\n\n> Hakeem: It might be snowing outside.\\\n> Fabian: No/that's wrong/that's false, it can't be snowing. I just\n> looked out the window and there were clear skies and the sun was out.\\\n> Hakeem: Really? Then I guess I was mistaken.\n\nIf *It might be that p* is true iff the speaker's knowledge is\ncompatible with *p*, as it does on a simple contextualist theory, then\nnone of this conversation makes any sense. But, argue relativists, it is\nperfectly natural. A natural move here is to argue that the problem with\nsimple contextualism isn't the contextualism, but the simplicity.\nExploring the moves that can be made here will take us too far afield;\n@MacFarlane2014 goes through a number of possible alternative\ncontextualist theories and shows how examples like the ones involving\nKim, Hakeem and Fabian can be generated to raise problems for each of\nthem. Instead, let's look at how the relativist handles the cases.\n\nAccording to MacFarlane, relativists are committed to the following\nprinciple about retraction:\n\n> The speaker ought to retract the assertion if she has good grounds for\n> thinking that its content is false (as assessed from the perspective\n> she currently occupies).\n\nGiven that Kim and Hakeem are evaluating their earlier utterances from\nnew perspectives, perspectives where the assertions are now judged to be\nfalse, they both should retract that earlier assertion because they now\ntake them to be false. But arguably this principle overgenerates.\nConsider this example from @vonFintelGillies2008.\n\n> Alex: The keys might be in the drawer.\\\n> Billy: (Looks in the drawer, agitated) They're not. Why did you say\n> that?\\\n> Alex: Look, I didn't say that they were in the drawer. I said they\n> might be there -- and they might have been. Sheesh.\n>  [@vonFintelGillies2008 81]\n\nThe lesson they draw from the example is that retraction is somewhat\nvoluntary. Despite what relativists claim, it is not always true that\n'might' claims are retracted or rejected in light of new evidence.\nInstead, what seems to be true is that that solipsistic readings for the\nmodals are virtually always available. They say that the relativist\ncan't easily explain this data. @MacFarlane2014 [Ch. 10] responds by\nsaying, in effect, that epistemic modal claims sometimes mean what\ncontextualists say they mean, and this is compatible with relativism.\n\n#### Disagreement and Agreement {#disagreementandagreement}\n\nThe data about retraction are closely related to a phenomenon that\nclassically was central to debates about relativism. A traditional\nargument for relativism is that it is necessary to explain 'faultless\ndisagreement'. If one person says Vegemite is tasty, and another says\nthat it is not, the alleged datum is that they are disagreeing, but\nneither is wrong. Objective treatments of taste save the phenomenon of\ndisagreement, but lose the faultlessness. Contextualist, or otherwise\nsubjective, treatments of taste save the faultlessness, but lose the\ndisagreement. Relativism was alleged to keep both. Faultless\ndisagreement plays a big role in @Kolbel2002, but it has dropped out of\nthe recent literature somewhat. But the focus on disagreement remains,\nwith the central claim being that contextualists cannot explain why some\nconversations are genuinely disagreements. The following is how\nMacFarlane puts the point using an example from predicates of personal\ntaste:\n\n> If the truth of my claim that a food is \"tasty\" depends on how it\n> strikes me, while the truth of your claim that the same food is \"not\n> tasty\" depends on how it strikes you, then our claims are compatible,\n> and we do not disagree in making them. But it seems that we do\n> disagree--even if we are aware that the source of our disagreement is\n> our differing tastes.  [@MacFarlane2014 8]\n\nThis is no argument against any kind of objectivist treatment of\npredicates of personal taste. The issue is solely whether relativism or\ncontextualism does a better job of explaining the facts about\ndisagreement. We'll look at a couple of reasons for thinking that the\nproblem is less pressing for contextualists than it might first seem,\nthen an interesting attempt to resolve the problems that remain for\ncontextualism, then at some reasons for doubting that relativism helps\nsolve the remaining problems.\n\n#### Clarifying the Data {#clarifyingthedata}\n\nThe puzzle for contextualism is supposed to be that there is a big\ndifference between the felicity of Mark's reply in the following two\ncases.\n\n> Sally: This chilli is tasty.\\\n> Mark: I disagree. It's too hot.\n\n> Sally: I'm from Barcelona.\\\n> Mark: I disagree. \\#I'm from Oslo.\n\nAssume Sally and Mark are both being sincere. So Sally does like the\nchilli and is from Barcelona, and Mark doesn't like it and is from Oslo.\nIn neither case can Mark sincerely repeat the words that Sally uttered.\nIndeed, he can sincerely utter the negations of the sentences Sally\nuttered. But in the first case, this seems to amount to a disagreement,\nand in the second case it does not. If the context-sensitivity of\n'tasty' and 'I' is explained the same way, this is mysterious.\n\nBut note that there are other examples that do not seem to be amenable\nto a relativist treatment where Mark can express disagreement with\nSally.\n\n> Sally: I like this chilli.\\\n> Mark: I disagree. It is too hot.\n\nWhat seems to be going on there is that Mark is disagreeing with an\nattitude that Sally has, but not with any proposition she expressed.\nAfter all, Mark presumably agrees with the proposition that Sally likes\nthe chilli. That's why he knows he is disagreeing with her. And that's\nthe content of what he uttered. So some disagreements that are triggered\nby assertions are not with the content of what is asserted. This might\nbe the germ of an idea for how contextualists can explain the data about\ndisagreement, one nicely developed by Torfinn @Huvenes2012. He argues\nthat in a lot of cases of disagreements involving taste, what we see is\nnot a disagreement about any content, but a disagreement of attitudes.\n\n> Two parties disagree just in case there is something towards which\n> they have conflicting attitudes. This sometimes means that there is a\n> content that one party accepts and the other rejects, but that does\n> not always have to be the case. Just as two parties may have\n> conflicting beliefs, they may also have conflicting desires or\n> preferences.  [@Huvenes2012 178]\n\nIf Huvenes is right, then we can't draw any conclusions for semantics\nfrom the facts about disagreement.\n\nThere is a further problem with using facts about disagreement to argue\nagainst contextualism. Consider the following dialogue.\n\n> Sally: Joe might be in Boston.\\\n> Mark: I disagree; he's definitely in China.\n\nIf *Joe might be in Boston* just means *For all I know, Joe is in\nBoston*, then it is prima facie unclear why Mark is disagreeing. After\nall, it is consistent with Joe's being in China that for all Sally\nknows, Joe is in Boston. But, say some contextualists, Mark need not\ndisagree with the whole content of Sally's utterance. He may just be\ndisagreeing with the *prejacent* of the modal, i.e., that Joe is in\nBoston.\n\nMost of the terms of disagreement that have been used in examples\nmotivating anti-contextlism can be seen to target something other than\nthe entire proposition  [@vonFintelGillies2008 83]. This is a particular\nproblem for arguments for relativism involving epistemic modals. It's\npossible to say \"I disagree\", \"that's false\", \"no\", or \"you're mistaken\"\nand disagree with the prejacent of someone's modal claim, not\nnecessarily the whole claim.\n\nOne potential avenue for the relativist to get around this worry is to\nlimit the range of disagreement markers that count as expressing the\nright kind of disagreement. For example, Tamina @Stephenson2007 limits\nthe terms of disagreement in the examples she uses to \"no\" and \"nuh-uh\".\nAnd John @MacFarlane2014 [11] discusses disagreements that more\nexplicitly target the entire asserted proposition such as \"the\nproposition you expressed is false\" and \"what you asserted is false\".\nThe issue with the two former disagreement markers is that they can\nexplicitly target the embedded clause of an expression. Indeed,\nStephenson herself provides a clear example of this phenomenon.\n\n> Mary: How's the cake?\\\n> Sam: I think it's tasty.\\\n> Sue: Nuh-uh, it isn't tasty at all!  [@Stephenson2007 512]\n\nThe issue with the disagreement markers that MacFarlane uses is that\nthey have become too technical to do the type of work they need to do.\nRelativism is meant to be an empirical thesis that relied on natural\nlanguage data to back it up. We have moved well outside of the realm of\nnatural language and the types of natural language intuitions about the\nacceptability of sentences that we can get when we move to \"the\nproposition you expressed is false\" and \"what you asserted is false\".\n\nNote that the two contextualist responses we've described here are\nrather complementary. The point Huvenes makes, that disagreements can\ninvolve attitudes other than belief, seems best served to defuse\narguments from disagreements concerning predicates of personal taste.\nAnd the point that von Fintel and Gillies make, that disagreements can\ntarget prejacents, seems best served to defuse arguments from\ndisagreements concerning epistemic modals. It is possible there are\nreplies to this last point; @WeathersonEgan2011 for example suggest that\nexamples involving agreements are invulnerable to the response that von\nFintel and Gillies make. But as it stands, the dominant trend in the\nliterature seems to be in the direction of thinking the contextualist\nhas the resources to answer these relativist arguments.\n\n#### Presuppositions and Common Context {#presuppositionsandcommoncontext}\n\nThere is a more radical, and perhaps more concessive, response to the\ndisagreement arguments available to the contextualist. Dan\n@LopezDeSa2008b develops a contextualist theory that explains the\ndisagreement data by positing that for many context-sensitive terms,\nthere is a presupposition that users of the term are in the same\ncontext. (Note that López de Sa calls his theory an \"indexical\nrelativist\" theory, but it is a kind of contextualist theory in the way\nthe terms are being used here.)\n\nIt isn't true in general that there is a presupposition of commonality\nof context. If two speakers both say \"I am happy\", they should be\ninterpreted as putting forward different propositions. And that is\nbecause, in the relevant sense, they are in different contexts. But,\nperhaps, many terms are not like this. In particular, cases where there\nappears to be a problem with explaining the phenomena involving\ndisagreement, perhaps this is not so. So consider the stock example\nLópez de Sa uses, a variant on one that may seem familiar by now.\n\n> Hannah: Homer Simpson is funny.\\\n> Sarah: I disagree. Homer is not funny.\n\nIf 'funny' denotes a different property when Hannah and Sarah use it,\nthere is no disagreement about propositional content here. And the\ncontextualist account of predicates of personal taste would predict that\nit could, and perhaps often will, denote a different propertty on\ndifferent occasions of usage. But it seems that there is a disagreement\nhere, and arguably even one about propositional content. The solution\nLópez de Sa offers is that in any conversation, there is a\npresupposition that we are applying the same aesthetic standards. The\nmodel he uses is a suggestion made by David @Lewis1989b in defending a\ncontextualist treatment of claims about value.\n\n> Wouldn't you hear them saying 'value for me and my mates' or value for\n> the likes of you'? Wouldn't you think they'd stop arguing after one\n> speaker says X is a value and the other says it isn't? -- Not\n> necessarily. They might always presuppose, with more or less\n> confidence (well-founded or otherwise), that whatever relativity there\n> is won't matter in this conversation.  [@Lewis1989b 84]\n\nHere is how López de Sa develops the point.\n\n> According to the approach, 'is funny' triggers a presupposition of\n> commonality to the effect that both Hannah and Sarah are similar with\n> respect to humor. Thus, in any non-defective conservation where Hannah\n> uttered 'Homer is funny' and Sarah replied 'No, it is not,' it would\n> indeed be common ground that Hannah and Sarah are relevantly alike,\n> and thus that they are contradicting each other. After all, provided\n> they are alike, either both Hannah and Sarah are amused by Homer or\n> they are not.  [@LopezDeSa2008b 305]\n\nThis is an ingenious idea, but there are a few hurdles to be cleared\nbefore it could be declared a full solution to the problem. First, it\nneeds a way to deal with eavesdroppers. If Hannah writes \"Homer Simpson\nis funny\" on a scrap of paper, and later Sarah chances upon that paper,\nshe can still say that she disagrees. But it is very odd to think there\nis a presupposition of commonality of taste with anyone who chances upon\none's writings. Second, it needs to account for cases where the\npresupposition is expressly cancelled. The Hannah/Sarah dialogue feels\nnatural even in cases where it has been made explicit that Hannah and\nSarah have completely different tastes, and they are displaying their\ndifferences for the amusement of their friends  [@MacFarlane2014\n131--2]. Third, it doesn't quite capture the idea that Hannah and Sarah\nare contradicting each other. When Sarah disagrees, it shows that either\nthere is a proposition one accepts and the other rejects, or that the\ncontext is defective. If we thought the data was that there was a\ncontradiction between what they say, López de Sa's approach can't\nexplain that. And finally, it isn't obvious how to extend this theory to\nother terms for which relativism seems promising. It is one thing to say\nthat conversations about humor presuppose a common standard for humor.\nIt is much less plausible to say that conversations about what might be\nthe case presuppose that the parties to the conversation know the same\nthings. None of these hurdles seem impossible to clear, but they do\nraise doubts about whether presuppositions can solve all the\ncontextualists' problems with disagreement.\n\n#### Relativism and Disagreement {#relativismanddisagreement}\n\nIf, after all that, we conclude that the contextualist still has a\nproblem with disagreement, it's fair to ask whether the relativist does\nany better. Let's think again about López de Sa's example of Hannah and\nSarah.\n\n> Hannah: Homer Simpson is funny.\\\n> Sarah: I disagree. Homer is not funny.\n\nA simple relativist theory assigns truth conditions to Hannah's\nutterance relative to a context of utterance, her own, and an index that\nconsists of a world-perspective pair. (Remember that we're using\n'perspective' to cover everything other than a world that a relativist\nmay want to put into an index, and that it will be a structured entity.)\nThe content of Hannah's utterance will be set by her context. So it will\nbe (or at least will determine) a function from indices, i.e.,\nworld-perspective pairs, to truth-values. Call the world Hannah and\nSarah occupy $w$, and their perspectives $p_H$ and $p_S$. Then the\nproposition that Homer Simpson is funny will be true relative to\n$\\langle w, p_H\\rangle$ and false relative to $\\langle w, p_S\\rangle$.\nSo there is a proposition Hannah accepts and Sarah rejects, and so they\ndisagree. Doesn't think mean that the relativist can explain the sense\nin which Hannah and Sarah disagree?\n\nNot so fast. Consider another case involving One, who lives in $w_1$\nwhere Mars has one moon, and Two, who lives in $w_2$ where Mars has two\nmoons. They make the following utterances:\n\n> One: Mars has one moon.\\\n> Two: Mars has two moons.\n\nNow most theorists would say that One and Two have expressed\npropositions that cannot be true together. (As noted earlier,\n@Schaffer2012 disagrees, though not in a way that helps relativism.) But\nthey don't disagree. Among other things, they both think that the other\nspeaks truly.\n\nHannah doesn't just think that the proposition that Homer Simpson is\nfunny is true relative to $\\langle w, p_H\\rangle$; she thinks it is\nsimply true. That is because she occupies (for want of a better word)\nthe index $\\langle w, p_H\\rangle$. And one doesn't just think that the\nproposition that Mars has one moon is true relative to\n$\\langle w_1, p_1\\rangle$, she thinks it is simply true. But in doing\nso, she need not be in disagreement with someone who occupies a\ndifferent index, such as Two, and who thinks it is false. It isn't easy\nto read off the existence of disagreement from the endorsement of\nconflicting propositions when the parties occupy different indices. And\nthat raises doubts about whether the relativist has really explained the\ndisagreement. (The Mars example is from @MacFarlane2014 [128]. Both\n@Dreier2009 and @Francen2010 raise doubts about whether the relativist\ncan explain disagreement.)\n\nPart of MacFarlane's response to this is to insist that the different\nelements of an index are treated differently. If we are relativists\nabout propositional truth, but not utterance truth, it is natural to\ntreat the two elements the same. A speaker, we'll then say, speaks truly\niff the proposition they express is true relative to the context they\noccupy. But that isn't MacFarlane's view. He holds that an utterance is\ntrue, i.e., that a speaker speaks truly, relative to a context of\nassessment iff the proposition they express is true relative to the\nworld they occupy, and the perspective of the context of assessment.\nThis gives him a way to distinguish the Hannah/Sarah case from the\nOne/Two case. There is still a lot more work to do to turn this into a\nfull theory of disagreement, and chapter 5 of MacFarlane's book has a\nvery careful study of the varieties of disagreement that are possible on\na relativst theory, and how they can be used to explain the data. We're\nnot going to attempt to evaluate the success of these responses, but\nrather conclude by noting that even if the contextualist has work to do\nto explain the phenomena involving disagreement, so does the relativist.\n\n#### Problems with the Data {#problemswiththedata}\n\nMost of the arguments in the literature have started with intuitions\nabout disagreeement. We don't think there is anything wrong with this in\nprinciple; indeed, it is what we've done so far. But when the intuitions\nget a little shaky, as they are in a few cases we've described so far,\nit is worth checking them more carefully, against a broader range of\ninformants. And when that is done, it isn't clear that the data help the\nrelativists as much as the relativists have claimed. @KnobeYalcin2014\nprovide evidence that the following claim, which we'll call (J), isn't\nas empirically justified as the relativists have made it out to be.\n\n> \\(J\\) Competent speaker/hearers tend to judge a present-tense bare\n> epistemic possibility claim (BEP) true only if the prejacent is\n> compatible with their information (whether or not they are the\n> producer of that utterance); otherwise the BEP is judged false.\n\nThey argue that many relativists, in particular Egan and MacFarlane, are\ncommitted to this claim. Although Egan and MacFarlane differ on several\npoints (Egan takes relativism about propositional truth to be primary,\nMacFarlane relativism about utterance truth), it does seem true that (J)\nis important to both of them. As Knobe and Yalcin put it,\n\n> Egan and MacFarlane are both clearly animated by the thought that\n> \"people tend to assess epistemic modal claims for truth in light of\n> what they (the assessors) know, even if they realize that they know\n> more than the speaker (or relevant group) did at the time of\n> utterance\" (MacFarlane 2011: 160; see also Egan 2007: 2--5, the\n> section entitled \"Motivation for relativism: eavesdroppers\").\n>  [@KnobeYalcin2014 3--4]\n\nThis isn't what their data showed. The subjects were shown speakers\nwhose evidence strongly, but falsely, suggested that Fat Tony was dead.\nThey overwhelmingly said that an utterance of \"Fat Tony is dead\" is\nfalse, but most said an utterance of \"Fat Tony might be dead\" was true.\n(Though it is worth noting that the responses displayed a considerably\nambivalence; the answers weren't in line with what either a\ncontextualist or a relativist would straightforwardly predict.) The\nsubjects did say that it would be correct for the speaker who said \"Fat\nTony might be dead\" to retract that utterance once it was clear Fat Tony\nwas alive. But this typically wasn't because they thought the earlier\nutterance was false.\n\nThe point of this study was not to directly target intuitions about\ndisagreement, but rather inter-contextual judgments and felicity of\nretraction. But the issues are closely related. If subjects who know Fat\nTony is alive don't judge that an utterance of \"Fat Tony might be dead\"\nis false, then either they don't disagree with such an utterer, or the\ndisagreement is, as Huvenes suggests, not the kind that motivates\naltering our semantics in the direction relativists suggest.\n\nAs Knobe and Yalcin are careful to note, even if relativists were\ncompletely wrong about inter-contextual evaluation of utterances, about\ndisagreement, and about retraction, there are still other arguments for\nrelativism. We'll end with one other such argument, due primarily to\nTamina @Stephenson2007.\n\n### Control and Syntax {#controlandsyntax}\n\nThere is a striking semantic/syntactic phenomenon that epistemic modals\nand predicates of personal taste share. It's easiest to describe the\nphenomenon if we assume a contextualist semantics, though we'll\neventually use the puzzle to cast doubt on that semantics. So assume,\nfor now, that *It must be that p* is true iff *p* is guaranteed to be\ntrue by the (possibly idealised) knowledge of *X*, where *X* is an\nindividual or group supplied by context. (And perhaps the amount of\nidealisation is context-sensitive too.) And assume that *F is tasty* is\ntrue iff *F* tastes good to (the possibly idealised version of) *X*,\nwhere *X* is again supplied by context.\n\nWhen 'might' or 'tasty' are not embedded, then *X* seems like it has to\ninclude the speaker, and perhaps not much more than that. Even making\nsome other taster or knower salient does not suffice to change the value\nof *X*. For instance, if one utters \"Joe is a great cook and connoisseur\nof fine food. The meals he prepares are always tasty,\" the last sentence\nis not naturally construed as saying that *Joe* always likes the taste\nof what Joe cooks, but that the speaker and her hearer do (or will). Or\nif, to borrow an example from  [@Weatherson2011-NoRoyal], we say \"Jones\nmust know who the killer is,\" the relevant *X* for interpreting the\n'must' consists of the speaker and her hearers, not Jones. There is\nsomething strange about this; it normally isn't that hard to make others\nrelevant in a way that makes them the value of a contextually filled\nvariable.\n\nOr, perhaps, it isn't normally that hard with one key exception. Some\ncontext-sensitive terms have, as part of their meaning, that their\nextension includes the speaker. Such terms include 'I' and 'we'. Perhaps\n'must' and 'tasty' are like 'I' and 'we' in this respect. Except, and\nhere is Stephenson's key insight, there is a big difference between\n'I'/'we' and 'must'/'tasty'. The former still pick out the speaker (and\nperhaps those near her) under the sceopt of an attitude verb. The latter\ndo not. Consider the natural interpretations of these sentences.\n\n-   Joe thinks my gumbo is tasty.\n\n-   Joe thinks we must have stolen the candy.\n\nIn each case, the personal pronouns ('my', 'we') have their customary\ndenotations. It is the speaker's gumbo that is being praised, and the\nspeaker and her friends who are being suspected of theft. But 'tasty'\nand 'must' do not behave like that. It isn't that Joe thinks the speaker\nlikes the taste of her gumbo, but that Joe himself does. And it isn't\nthat Joe thinks the speaker's evidence entails her guilt, but that Joe's\nevidence does.\n\nStephenson points out that we get even more dramatic results with more\ncomplex sentences. Consider these two sentences.\n\n-   Mary thinks that Sam thinks it must be raining.\n\n-   Mary thinks that Sam must think it is raining.  [@Stephenson2007\n    490]\n\nThe value of *X* for the first 'must' has to be Sam, and for the second\n'must' it has to be Mary. In neither case is it the speaker, and in\nneither case is it even particularly optional how to interpret the\n'must'. Compare *Mary thinks that Jane likes her house*, which is\nnaturally read as three-way ambiguous. (The house might be Jane's, or\nMary's, or a contextually supplied third party's.) The general point\nhere is that the *X* values that the contextualist posits behave rather\nunlike other implicit or explicit context-sensitive terms.\n\nThe relativist explanation of this is that epistemic modals, and\npredicates of personal taste are, to use Stephenson's phrase,\n\"inherently judge-dependent\". That is, they are inherently dependent on\nsome perspective for their truth. In the terms we've been using so far,\nwe need a perpective in the index, and not just in the context, to\nexplain the truth of these claims. When this is combined with a natural\nview that attitude predicates obligatorily shift the perspective (or\njudge) parameter, then it just naturally falls out that epistemic modals\nmust take on the perspective of the immediate subjective of the attitude\nverb. Such a semantics is defended by Stephenson, and by Peter\n@Lasersohn2005.\n\nIt falls out of this semantics that there cannot be \"exocentric\" uses of\nbare epistemic modals. These are uses of bare epistemic modals that take\non the perspective of someone other than the speaker. (A similar point\napplies to predicates of personal taste.) This is a nice explanation of\nthe fact that it is very hard to generate these exocentric uses. But it\narguably overgenerates; there are cases where it seems we do get the\nexocentric reading. Here is one case from @Egan2005-EGAEMI.\n\n> Ann is planning a surprise party for Bill. Unfortunately, Chris has\n> discovered the surprise and told Bill all about it. Now Bill and Chris\n> are having fun watching Ann try to set up the party without being\n> discovered. Currently Ann is walking past Chris's apartment carrying a\n> large supply of party hats. She sees a bus on which Bill frequently\n> rides home, so she jumps into some nearby bushes to avoid being\n> spotted. Bill, watching from Chris's window, is quite amused, but\n> Chris is puzzled and asks Bill why Ann is hiding in the bushes. Bill\n> says, \"I might be on that bus\"  [@Egan2005-EGAEMI 140]\n\nThe natural reading of what Bill says is that for all *Ann* knows, Bill\nis on the bus. And this is predicted to be impossible on the type of\nrelativist view that gets us the correct results in the obligatory\ncontrol cases. Stephenson suggests that there is an ellipsis in Bill's\nsentence. It should really be understood as:\n\n-   Ann is hiding in the bushes because I might be on that bus.\n\nSo in a sense, it isn't a bare epistemic modal; it is in a\n'because'-clause. Moreover, suggests Stephenson, we should take\n'because'-clauses to express something like a person's conscious\nreasoning or rationale. So in this case 'because' acts like an attitude\nverb and shift the perspective (or judge) of the epistemic modal. (A\nsimilar move, in response to a similar objection, is defended by John\n@MacFarlane2014 [272ff].)\n\nThe relativist needs two premises here for the defence to work. The\nfirst is that all these exocentric uses are either in the scope of an\nattitude verb, or are in an explanatory context. The second is that it\nis fair to treat 'because' as sufficiently like an attitude verb for\nthese purposes. A contextualist could well object to either assumption.\nBut even if they grant both assumptions, a contextualist may want to\nsimply resist the whole line of reasoning. At most what these arguments\nabout control show is that 'might', and 'tasty', behave rather\ndifferently to other context-sensitive terms. There is nothing\ninconsistent about just accepting that as a surprising fact. And given\nhow radical a thesis relativism seems to many, accepting relativism as\nan explanation for these facts about control could well be an excessive\nreaction. The issues here have not been worked out in nearly as much\ndetail as the issues concerning disagreement and retraction, and we are\na long way from having a full accounting of the costs and benefits of\nthe possible dialectical moves.\n\n[^1]: Strictly speaking, to get MacFarlane's exact view which kinds of\n    views are relativist we need to complicate things even more.\n    MacFarlane explicitly leaves open the possibility that we have a\n    non-indexical contextualist view about some terms, and a relativist\n    view about others, and expressly says that such a view is a form of\n    relativism. So what we should say is that perspectives are\n    sub-divided into those features where the context of utterance is\n    relevant for utterance truth, and those where the context of\n    assessment is relevant to utterance truth. If the first set of\n    features of $p_u$, and the second set is $p_a$, then the utterance\n    $U$ of sentence $S$ in context $c_u$ will be true, relative to\n    $c_a$, iff $f_S(c_u, w(c_u), p_u(c_u), p_a(c_a)) = TRUE$.\n    MacFarlane's own view seems to be that $p_u$ will be empty, so the\n    simplified view we've given in the text is a fair representation of\n    how he thinks actual natural languages work. But there are possible\n    languages where the complications noted here are relevant.\n",
