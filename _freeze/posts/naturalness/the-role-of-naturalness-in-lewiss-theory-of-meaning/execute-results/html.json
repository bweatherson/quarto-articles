That orthodox interpretation is shared by both supporters and critics of Lewis's theory of meaning, but it has recently been strongly criticised by Wolfgang Schwarz. In this paper, I accept many of Schwarz's criticisms of the orthodox interpretation, and add some more. But I also argue that the orthodox interpretation has a grain of truth in it, and seeing that helps us appreciate the strength of Lewis's late theory of meaning.\ndate: May 20 2013\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\njournal: \n  title: \"Journal for the History of Analytical Philosophy\"\n  publisher: OJS\nvolume: 1\nissue: 10\ncitation_url: http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3521354.0004.003\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\ncategories:\n  - David Lewis\n  - language\n  - metaphysics\n  - history of analytic\nself-contained: false\npreview: natural.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: TRUE\n---\n\n\n\n\nIt is sometimes claimed (e.g., by @Sider2001-SIDCOP\n[@Sider4D; @Stalnaker2004-JACLOI-2; @Williams2007; @Weatherson2003-WEAWGA])\nthat David Lewis's theory of predicate meaning assigns a central role to\nnaturalness.[^2] Some of the people who claim this also say that the\ntheory they attribute to Lewis is true. The authors I have mentioned\naren't as explicit as each other about exactly which theory they are\nattributing to Lewis, but the rough intuitive idea is that the meaning\nof a predicate is the most natural property that is more-or-less\nconsistent with the usage of the predicate. Call this kind of\ninterpretation the 'orthodox' interpretation of Lewis.[^3] Recently\nWolfgang Schwarz [-@Schwarz2009 209ff] has argued that the orthodox\ninterpretation is a misinterpretation, and actually naturalness plays a\nmuch smaller role in Lewis's theory of meaning than is standardly\nassumed.[^4] Simplifying a lot, one key strand in Schwarz's\ninterpretation is that naturalness plays no role in the theory of\nmeaning in @Lewis1969a [@Lewis1975b], since Lewis hadn't formulated the\nconcept yet, and Lewis didn't abandon that theory of meaning, since he\nnever announced he was abandoning it, so naturalness doesn't play\nanything like the role orthodoxy assigns to it.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Journal for the History of Analytic Philosophy*, volume 1, number\n    10.\n</aside>\n\nIn this article I attempt to steer a middle ground between these two\npositions. I'm going to defend the following parcel of theses. These are\nall exegetical claims, but I'm also interested in defending most of the\ntheses that I ultimately attribute to Lewis, so getting clear on just\nwhat Lewis meant is of more than historical interest.\n\n1.  Naturalness matters to Lewis's (post-1983) theory of sentence\n    meaning only insofar as it matters to his theory of rationality, and\n    the theory of rationality matters to the (pre- and post-1983) theory\n    of meaning.\n\n2.  Naturalness might play a slightly larger role in Lewis's theory of\n    word meaning, but it isn't nearly as significant as the orthodox\n    view suggests.\n\n3.  When we work through Lewis's theory of word and sentence meaning, we\n    see that the orthodox interpretation assigns to Lewis a theory that\n    isn't his theory of meaning, but is by his lights a useful\n    heuristic.\n\n4.  An even better heuristic than 'meaning = use plus naturalness' would\n    be 'meaning = predication plus naturalness', but even this would be\n    a fallible heuristic, not a theory.\n\n5.  When correctly interpreted, Lewis's theory is invulnerable to the\n    challenges put forward in @Williams2007.\n\nI'm going to start by saying a little about the many roles naturalness\nplays in Lewis's philosophy, and about his big picture views on thought\nand meaning. Then I'll offer a number of arguments against the orthodox\ninterpretation of Lewis's theory of sentence meaning. After that, I'll\nturn to Lewis's theory of word meaning, where it is harder to be quite\nclear about just what the theory is, and how much it might have changed\nonce natural properties were added to the metaphysics. An appendix\ndiscusses some interpretative questions that arise if we are sceptical\nthat any one division of properties can do all the work that Lewis has\nthe natural/non-natural division do.\n\n### How Naturalness Enters The Theory of Meaning\n\nMost of the core elements of David Lewis's philosophy were present, at\nleast in outline, from his earliest work. The big exception is the\ntheory of natural properties introduced in @Lewis1983e. As he says in\nthat paper, he had previously believed that \"set theory applied to\npossibilia is all the theory of properties that anyone could ever need\"\n[@Lewis1983e 377n]. Once he introduces this new concept of naturalness,\nLewis puts it to all sorts of work throughout his philosophy. I'm rather\nsceptical that there is any one feature of properties that can do all\nthe varied jobs Lewis wants naturalness to do, but the grounds for, and\nconsequences of, this scepticism are a little orthogonal to the main\ntheme of this paper, so I've set it aside.\n\nAs the orthodox interpretation stresses, Lewis has naturalness do some\nwork in this theory of content. That he does think there's a connection\nbetween naturalness and content is undeniable from the most casual\nreading of his post-1983 work. But just how they are connected is less\nobvious. To spell out these connections, let's start with three Lewisian\nthemes.\n\n-   Facts about linguistic meaning are to be explained in terms of facts\n    about minds. In particular, to speak a language $\\mathcal{L}$ is to\n    have a convention of being truthful and trusting in $\\mathcal{L}$\n    [@Lewis1969a; @Lewis1975b]. And to have such a convention is a\n    matter of having certain beliefs and desires. So mental content is\n    considerably prior to linguistic content in a Lewisian theory.\n    Moreover, Lewis's theory of linguistic content is, in the first\n    instance, a theory of *sentence* meaning, not a theory of *word*\n    meaning. [^5]\n\n-   The principle of charity plays a central role in Lewis's theory of\n    mental content @Lewis1974c [@Lewis1994b]. To a first approximation,\n    a creature believes that $p$ iff the best interpretation of the\n    creature's behavioural dispositions includes the attribution of the\n    belief that $p$ to the creature. And, ceteris paribus, it is better\n    to interpret a creature so that it is more rather than less\n    rational. It will be pretty important for what follows that Lewis\n    adopts a principle of charity that highlights *rationality*, not\n    *truth*. It is also important to Lewis that we don't just interpret\n    the individual creature, but creatures of a kind [@Lewis1980c]. I'm\n    not going to focus on the social externalist features of Lewis's\n    theory of mental states, but I think they assist the broader story I\n    want to tell.\n\n-   Lewis's theory of mental content has it that mental contents are\n    (what most of us would call) properties, not (what most of us would\n    call) propositions [@Lewis1979b]. So a theory of natural properties\n    can easily play a role in the theory of mental content, since mental\n    contents are properties. If you think mental contents are\n    propositions, the connection between naturalness and mental content\n    will be more indirect. Just how indirect it is will depend on what\n    your theory of propositions is. But if mental contents are Lewisian\n    propositions, the connection may be very indirect indeed. After all,\n    propositions that we might pick out with sentences containing words\n    that denote very unnatural properties, such as *All emeroses are\n    gred*, might be intuitively very natural.\n\nNow let's see why we might end up with naturalness in the theory of\nmeaning. An agent has certain dispositions. For instance, after seeing a\nbunch of green emeralds, and no non-green emeralds, in a large and\ndiverse range of environments, she has a disposition to say \"All\nemeralds are green\". In virtue of what is she speaking a language in\nwhich \"green\" means green, and not grue? (Note that when *I* use \"grue\",\nI mean a property that only differs from greenness among objects which\nit is easy to tell that neither our agent, nor any of her interlocutors,\ncould possibly be acquainted with at the time she makes the utterance in\nquestion.)\n\nLet's say that $\\mathcal{L}_1$ is English, i.e., a language in which\n\"green\" means green, and $\\mathcal{L}_2$ a language which is similar to\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$ except that \"green\" means grue. Our question is, what\nmakes it the case that the agent is speaking $\\mathcal{L}_1$ and not\n$\\mathcal{L}_2$? That is, what makes it the case that the agent has\nadopted the convention of being truthful and trusting in\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$, and not the convention or being truthful and trusting\nin $\\mathcal{L}_2$?\n\nWe assumed that the agent has seen a lot of emeralds which are both\ngreen and grue. To a first approximation, it is more charitable to\nattribute to the agent the belief that all emeralds are green than the\nbelief that all emeralds are grue because greenness is more natural than\ngruesomeness. As Lewis says, \"The principles of charity will impute a\nbias towards believing things are green rather than grue\" [-@Lewis1983e\n375]. And for Lewis, charity requires imputing more reasonable\ninterpretations. But why is it more charitable to attribute beliefs\nabout greenness to beliefs about grueness? I think it is because we need\nmore evidence to rationally form a belief that some class of things are\nall grue than we need to form a belief that everything in that class is\ngreen. And that's because, ceteris paribus, we need more evidence to\nrationally form a belief that all $F$s are $G$s than that all $F$s are\n$H$s when $G$ is less natural than $H$. The agent has, we might assume,\nsufficient evidence to rationally believe that all emeralds are green,\nbut not sufficient evidence to believe that all emeralds are grue.\n\nSo the first two Lewisian themes notes above, the reduction of\nlinguistic meaning to mental content, and the centrality of a\nrationality-based principle of charity, push us towards thinking that\nnaturalness is closely connected to mental content and hence to\nlinguistic meaning. And it has pushed us towards thinking that if\nnaturalness is connected to meaning, it is via this connection I've\nposited between naturalness and rational belief. Note that Lewis doesn't\never endorse anything like that general a connection, but I suspect he\nhad something like this in mind when he wrote the sentence I quoted in\nthe previous paragraph. We'll come back to this interpretative question\nat some length below.\n\nBut the argument I offered was a bit quick, because I ignored the third\nLewisian theme: beliefs are relations to properties, not propositions.\nOn Lewis's theory, to believe that all emeralds are green is to\nself-ascribe the property of being in a world where all emeralds are\ngreen. So if a certain body of evidence makes it possible for the agent\nto rationally believe that all emeralds are green, but not for her to\nbelieve that all emeralds are grue, and that's because rationality is\nconstitutively connected to naturalness, then that must be because the\nfirst of the following properties is more natural than the second:\n\n-   Being in a world where all emeralds are green\n\n-   Being in a world where all emeralds are grue\n\nThat could still be true, though it is notable how far removed we are\nfrom the intuitions that motivate the distinctions between more and less\nnatural properties. It's not like there is some sense, intuitively, in\nwhich things that have the first property form a more unified class than\nthings that have the second property.\n\nSo it's plausible that naturalness is connected to mental content, at\nleast as long as naturalness is connected to rational belief. And since\nmental content is connected to linguistic content, we're now in the\nvicinity of the orthodox interpretation. But I don't think the orthodox\ninterpretation can be right. I'll give four reasons for this, starting\nwith the textual evidence for and against it.\n\n### Textual Evidence about Sentence Meaning\n\nThere is some *prima facie* textual evidence for the orthodox\ninterpretation. But looking more careful at the context of these texts\nnot just undermines the support the text gives to the orthodox\ninterpretation, but actually tells against it. (This part of the paper\nis indebted even more than the rest to Wolfgang Schwarz's work, and\ncould be easily skipped by those familiar with that work.)\n\nI'll focus on the last seven pages of \"New Work for a Theory of\nUniversals\". This is the part of \"New Work\" that uses the notion of\nnaturalness, as introduced in the paper, to respond to Putnam's\nmodel-theoretic arguments for massive indeterminacy of meaning. Lewis\nactually responds to Putnam twice over. First, he responds to Putnam\ndirectly, by showing how adding naturalness to a use-based theory of\nsentence meaning avoids the 'just more theory' objection that's central\nto Putnam's argument. And when Lewis describes this direct response, he\nsays things that sound a lot like the orthodox interpretation.\n\n> I would instead propose that the saving constraint concerns the\n> referent - not the referrer, and not the causal channels between the\n> two. It takes two to make a reference, and we will not find the\n> constraint if we look for it always on the wrong side of the\n> relationship. Reference consists in part of what we do in language or\n> thought when we refer, but in part it consists in eligibility of the\n> referent. And this eligibility to be referred to is a matter of\n> natural properties. [@Lewis1983e 371]\n\nBut after this direct response is finished, Lewis notes that he has\nconceded quite a lot to Putnam in making the response.\n\n> You might well protest that Putnam's problem is misconceived,\n> wherefore no need has been demonstrated for resources to solve it. ...\n> Where are the communicative intentions and the mutual expectations\n> that seem to have so much to do with what we mean? In fact, where is\n> thought? ...I think the point is well taken, but I think it doesn't\n> matter. If the problem of intentionality is rightly posed there will\n> still be a threat of radical indeterminacy, there will still be a need\n> for saving constraints, there will still be a remedy analogous to\n> Merrill's suggested answer to Putnam, and there will still be a need\n> for natural properties. [@Lewis1983e 373]\n\nI noted earlier that Schwarz makes much of a similar passage in\n\"Putnam's Paradox\", and I think he is right to do so. Here's a crucial\nquote from that paper.\n\n> I shall acquiesce in Putnam's linguistic turn: I shall discuss the\n> semantic interpretation of language rather than the assignment of\n> content to attitudes, thus ignoring the possibility that the latter\n> settles the former. It would be better, I think, to start with the\n> attitudes and go on to language. But I think that would relocate,\n> rather than avoid, the problem; wherefore I may as well discuss it on\n> Putnam's own terms. [@Lewis1984b 222]\n\nThat passage ends with a footnote where he says the final section of\n\"New Work\" contains a version of how the 'relocated' problem would be\nsolved. So let's turn back to that. The following long portmanteau quote\nfrom pages 373 to 375 captures, I think, the heart of my interpretation.\n\n> The problem of assigning content to functionally characterised states\n> is to be solved by means of constraining principles. Foremost among\n> these are principles of fit. ...A state typically caused by round\n> things before the eyes is a good candidate for interpretation as the\n> visual experience of confronting something round; and its typical\n> impact on the states interpreted as systems of belief ought to be\n> interpreted as the exogenous addition of a belief that one is\n> confronting something round, with whatever adjustment that addition\n> calls for. ...Call two worlds equivalent iff they are alike in respect\n> of the subject's evidence and behaviour, and note that any decent\n> world is equivalent inter alia to horrendously counterinductive worlds\n> and to worlds where everything unobserved by the subject is\n> horrendously nasty. ...We can interchange equivalent worlds ad lib and\n> preserve fit. So, given any fitting and reasonable interpretation, we\n> can transform it into an equally fitting perverse interpretation by\n> swapping equivalent worlds around ...If we rely on principles of fit\n> to do the whole job, we can expect radical indeterminacy of\n> interpretation. We need further constraints, of the sort called\n> principles of (sophisticated) charity, or of 'humanity'. [A footnote\n> here refers to \\\"Radical Interpretation\\\".] Such principles call for\n> interpretations according to which the subject has attitudes that we\n> would deem reasonable for one who has lived the life that he has\n> lived. (Unlike principles of crude charity, they call for imputations\n> of error if he has lived under deceptive conditions.) These principles\n> select among conflicting interpretations that equally well conform to\n> the principles of fit. They impose *apriori* -- albeit defeasible -\n> presumptions about what sorts of things are apt to be believed and\n> desired ...**It is here that we need natural properties.** The\n> principles of charity will impute a bias toward believing that things\n> are green rather than grue ...In short, they will impute eligible\n> content ...They will impute other things as well, but it is the\n> imputed eligibility that matters to us at present. [@Lewis1983e 373-5,\n> my emphasis]\n\nI think that does a reasonably clear job of supporting the\ninterpretation I set out in the introduction over the orthodox\ninterpretation. Naturalness matters to linguistic meaning all right. But\nthe chain of influence is very long and indirect. Naturalness constrains\nwhat is reasonable, reasonableness constrains charitable\ninterpretations, charitable interpretations constrain mental content,\nand mental content constrains linguistic content. Without naturalness at\nthe first step, we get excessive indeterminacy of content. With it, the\nPutnamian problems are solved. But there's no reason to think\nnaturalness has any more direct role to play at any level in the theory\nof linguistic content.\n\nIn short, Lewis changed what he thought about rationality when he\nadopted the theory of natural properties. Since rationality was a part\nof his theory of mental content, and mental content determines\nlinguistic content, this change had downstream consequences for what he\nsaid about linguistic content. But there wasn't any other way his theory\nof linguistic content changed, nor, contra orthodoxy, any direct link\nbetween naturalness and predicate meaning.\n\nMoreover, when we look at the closest thing to a worked example in\n@Lewis1983e, we don't get any motivation for the orthodox\ninterpretation. Here's the example he uses, which concerns mental\ncontent. Let $f$ be any mapping from worlds to worlds such that the\nagent has the same evidence and behaviour in $w$ and $f(w)$. Extend $f$\nto a mapping from sets of worlds to sets of worlds in the following\n(standard) way: $f(S) = \\{f(w): w \\in S\\}$. Then the agent's behaviour\nwill be rationalised by her evidence just as much if she has credence\nfunction $C$ and value function $V$, as if she has credence function\n$C^\\prime$ and value function $V^\\prime$, where $C^\\prime(f(S)) = C(S)$,\nand $V^\\prime(f(S)) = V(S)$. To relate this back to the familiar\nGoodmanian puzzle, let $f$ map any world where all emeralds are green to\nnearest world where all emeralds are grue, and vice versa, and map any\nother world to itself. Then the above argument will say that the agent's\nbehaviour is rationalised by her evidence just as much as if her\ncredences are $C$ as if they are $C^\\prime$. That is, her behaviour is\nrationalised by her evidence just as much if she gives very high\ncredence to all emeralds being green as to all emeralds being grue. So\nunderstanding charity merely as rationalizing behaviour leaves us\nwithout a way to say that the agent believes unobserved emeralds are\ngreen and not grue.\n\nLewis's solution is to say that charity requires more than that. In\nparticular, it requires that we assign natural rather than unnatural\nbeliefs to agents where that is possible. I've argued above that this\nmakes perfect sense if we connect naturalness with rationality. The\ncrucial thing to note here is that this all happens a long time before\nwe can set out the way that a sentence is used, since the way a sentence\nis used on Lewis's theory of linguistic content includes the beliefs\nthat are formed on hearing it. So the discussion in \"New Work\" suggests\nthat naturalness matters for content, but not in a way that can be\neasily factorised out. And that's exactly what I think is the best way\nto understand Lewis's theory.\n\n### Textual Evidence and Naturalness and Rationality\n\nA major part of my argument above was that naturalness affected Lewis's\ntheory of rationality. In particular, once he had naturalness to work\nwith, he seemed to think that it was more rational to project natural\nrather than unnatural properties. The textual evidence for this is, I'll\nadmit, fragmentary. But it is fairly widespread. Let's start with a\nquote we've already seen.\n\n> The principles of charity will impute a bias toward believing that\n> things are green rather than grue [@Lewis1983e 375]\n\nAs noted above, I assume this isn't a special feature of green and grue,\nbut rather that there is a general principle in favour of projecting\nnatural properties. But it would be good to have more evidence for that.\n\nLewis returns to the example of the believer in grue emeralds a few\ntimes. Here is one version of the story in *Plurality*.\n\n> We think that some sorts of belief and desire $\\dots$ would be\n> unreasonable in a strong sense $\\dots$ utterly unintelligible and\n> nonsensical. Think of the man who, for no special reason, expects\n> unexamined emeralds to be grue. $\\dots$ What makes the perversely\n> twisted assignment of content incorrect, however well it fits the\n> subject's behaviour, is exactly that it assigns ineligible,\n> unreasonable content when a more eligible assignment would have fit\n> behaviour equally well. [@Lewis1986a 38-9]\n\nAnd a little later, when replying to Kaplan's paradox, he says,\n\n> Given a fitting assignment, we can scramble it into an equally fitting\n> but perverse alternative assignment. Therefore a theory of content\n> needs a second part: as well as principles of fit, we need 'principles\n> of humanity', which create a presumption in favour of some sorts of\n> content and against others. [@Lewis1986a 107]\n\nHe returns to this point again in \"Reduction of Mind\".\n\n> [Folk psychology] sets presumptive limits on what our contents of\n> belief and desire can be. Self-ascribed properties may be 'far from\n> fundamental', I said -- but not *too* far. Especially gruesome\n> gerrymanders are *prima facie* ineligible to be contents of belief and\n> desire. In short, folk psychology says that we make sense. It credits\n> us with a modicum of rationality in our acting, believing and\n> desiring. [@Lewis1994b 320 in reprint]\n\nThe running thread through these last three quotes is that our theory of\nmental content rules out gruesome assignments, and it does this because\nassigning rationality is constitutive of correctly interpreting. This\ncan only work if naturalness is connected to rationality. I've\nattributed a stronger claim to Lewis, that not only is naturalness\nconnected to rationality, but that the connection goes through\nprojection.[^6]\n\nOne piece of evidence for that is that Lewis says, in \"Meaning Without\nUse\" that Kripkenstein's challenge was \"formerly Goodman's challenge\"\n[@Lewis1992a 109]. He goes on to say that the solution to this challenge\n(or should that be 'these challenges') involves \"carrying more baggage\nof primitive distinctions or ontological commitments than some of us\nmight have hoped\" [@Lewis1992a 110]. A footnote on that sentence cites\n\"New Work\", in case it isn't obvious that the baggage here is the\ndistinction between natural and unnatural properties. So somehow, Lewis\nthinks that natural properties help solve Goodman's puzzle. I think that\nthe simplest such solution is the right one to attribute to Lewis;\nnatural properties are *prima facie* more eligible to be projected.\n\nA referee noted that this passage is a little odd; it appears to simply\nconflate a meta-semantical paradox with an epistemological paradox. But\nI think that just shows how much, for Lewis, meta-semantical questions\nare epistemological questions. Words get their meanings in virtue of our\nconventions. Our conventions consist of our beliefs and desires. And\nfacts about rationality are, in part, constitutive of what we believe\nand desire.\n\nFinally, consider the way in which the papers on natural properties are\nintroduced in *Papers in Metaphysics and Epistemology*. Lewis says that\n\"I had been persuaded by Goodman and others that all properties were\nequal: it was hopeless to try to distinguish 'natural' properties from\ngruesomely gerrymandered, disjunctive properties.\" [@Lewis1999a 1-2] A\nfootnote refers to *Fact, Fiction and Forecast*. Of course, the point of\n\"New Work\" is that Lewis abandons this, explicitly Goodmanian, view. Now\nthat he had learned property egalitarianism from Goodman of course\ndoesn't show that once he became a property inegalitarian, he applied\nthis to Goodman's own paradox. But it does seem striking that the only\ncitation of an egalitarian view is of *Fact, Fiction and Forecast*. I\ntake that to be some, inconclusive, evidence that Lewis did indeed think\nnatural properties were related to Goodman's paradox.\n\nUltimately, it seems the textual evidence is this. There are many\ndifferent occasions where Lewis makes clear there is a connection\nbetween naturalness and rationality, and in particular, between\nnaturalness and the kind of rationality that is relevant to content\nassignment. There are hints that this connection goes via naturalness\nplaying a role in solving Goodman's paradox. Notably, there is no other\nobvious way in which naturalness could connect to rationality. At least,\nI can neither think of another connection, nor see any evidence for\nanother connection in the Lewis corpus. So I conclude, a little\ntentatively, that Lewis thought natural properties had a role to play in\nsolving Goodman's paradox.\n\n### Word Meaning and Naturalness\n\nIn \"Languages and Language\", Lewis doesn't say that human linguistic\npractices merely determine truth conditions for the spoken sentences.\nThat is, our linguistic practices don't merely determine which\n**language**, in Lewis's sense, we speak. They also determine, to some\nextent, a **grammar**, which specifies the truth conditional\ncontribution of the various parts of the sentence. The grammar\ndetermines the \"fine structure of meaning\" [@Lewis1975b 177] of a\nsentence or phrase.\n\nIn comments on an earlier draft of this paper, an anonymous referee\nstressed that naturalness could enter directly into a theory of meaning\nonce we stopped focussing on sentence meaning, and started looking on\nword meaning. I don't mean to say the referee was endorsing any\nparticular role for naturalness in the theory of word meaning. But the\npoint that we need to say more about the Lewisian approach to word\nmeaning before we conclude that naturalness is only indirectly related\nto meaning is right. And I'm grateful for the encouragement to discuss\nit further.\n\nLewis has a short discussion of grammars in \"Languages and Language\",\nand another in \"Radical Interpretation\". It's worth looking at both of\nthese in turn. I'll take \"Languages and Language\" first, since even\nthough it has a slightly later publication date, in the respects we're\ndiscussing here it closely resembles the theory in *Convention*.\n\nOn pages 177-8 of that paper, Lewis notes three ways in which there may\nbe indeterminacy in the grammar.\n\n1.  A subject's behavioural dispositions and anatomy might\n    underdetermine their beliefs and desires.\n\n2.  The beliefs and desires might underdetermine the truth conditions of\n    their language.\n\n3.  The truth conditions of the language might underdetermine the\n    meanings of the individual words.\n\nWhile Lewis does not think the second is actually a source of\nindeterminacy, he does think that the third is.\n\n> My present discussion has been directed at the middle step $\\dots$ I\n> have said $\\dots$ that the beliefs and desires of the subject and his\n> fellows are such as to comprise a fully determinate convention of\n> truthfulness and trust in some definite language. $\\dots$ I am\n> inclined to share in Quine's doubts about the determinacy of the third\n> step. [@Lewis1975b 178]\n\nLewis gives reasons for this inclination a few paragraphs earlier. He\nsays that while we can say what it is for a community to speak one\nlanguage rather than another, we can't say what it is for a community to\nspeak one grammar rather than another. He says that we don't have any\nobjective measures for evaluating grammars. And he says Quine's examples\nof indeterminacy of reference show that languages can have multiple good\ngrammars, even if these disagree radically about the meaning of some\nconstituents.\n\nNotably, Lewis doesn't take to show that there is anything wrong with\nthe notion of word meaning. He says it would be \"absurd\" (177) to\nconclude that. His conclusion here is more one of modesty rather than\nphilosophical scepticism. We don't know how to extend the theory of\nsentence meaning he offers to a theory of word meaning, so we should do\nwhat we can without talking about word meaning.\n\nThe approach in \"Radical Interpretation\" has a bit more of a hint for\nhow to restore semantic determinacy. The subject matter of that paper is\nhow to solve for the mental and linguistic contents of a speaker, called\nKarl, given the physical facts about them. Lewis uses **M** for \"a\nspecification, in our language, of the meanings of expressions of Karl's\nlanguage.\" [@Lewis1974c 333] He lists a number of constraints on a\nsolution, including early versions of his principles of constitutive\nrationality. But the most notable constraint, from our perspective, is\nthis:\n\n> *The Principle of Generativity* constrains **M**: **M** should assign\n> truth conditions to the sentences of Karl's language in a way that is\n> at least finitely specifiable, and preferably also reasonably uniform\n> and simple. [@Lewis1974c 339]\n\nThere's something very odd about this. Lewis, in 1974, didn't have a\ntheory of what made an assignment simple. He needed his theory of\nnatural properties to do that. Or, at least, once he had the theory of\nnatural properties, it did all the work he ever wanted out of an account\nof simplicity.\n\nBe that as it may, it does suggest that Lewis did think that simplicity\nof assignments could be used as a way of cutting down the third kind of\nsemantic indeterminacy discussed in \"Languages and Language\". He doesn't\nthink it would generate a fully determinate interpretation of Karl's\nlanguage.\n\n> It seems hopeless to deny, in the face of such examples as those in\n> [Quine's \"Ontological Relativity\", pp. 30-39], that the truth\n> conditions of full sentences in **M** do not sutfice to determine the\n> rest of **M**: the parsings and the meanings of the constituents of\n> sentences. At least, that is so unless there is something more than\n> our Principle of Generativity to constrain this auxiliary syntactic\n> and semantic apparatus. [@Lewis1974c 342-3]\n\nIt's notable that some of the examples Quine gives in \"Ontological\nRelativity\" are not cases where the alternative meanings are by any\nmeasure equally natural. This positive allusion to Quine's examples\nsuggests a link to this comment in \"Languages and Language\"\n\n> We should regard with suspicion any method that purports to settle\n> objectively whether, in some tribe, \"gavagai\" is true of temporally\n> continuant rabbits or time-slices thereof. You can give their language\n> a good grammar of either kind---and that's that. [@Lewis1975b 177]\n\nNote that he doesn't say 'equally' good. And note also how this\ncontrasts with the attitude he takes towards the prospects of\nindeterminacy in sentence meaning. I earlier quoted him saying that part\nof the point of \"Languages and Language\" was to show how the second type\nof indeterminacy didn't arise. He ends \"Radical Interpretation\" with\nthis 'credo'.\n\n> Could indeterminacy of beliefs, desires, and truth conditions also\n> arise because two different solutions both fit all the constraints\n> perfectly? Here is the place to hold the line. This sort of\n> indeterminacy has not been shown by convincing examples, and neither\n> could it be shown--to me--by proof. *Credo*: if ever you prove to me\n> that all the constraints we have yet found could permit two perfect\n> solutions, differing otherwise than in the auxiliary apparatus of\n> **M**, then you will have proved that we have not yet found all the\n> constraints. [@Lewis1974c 343]\n\nSo that's where things stood before 1983. Lewis thought he had a theory\nthat eliminated, or at least minimised, indeterminacy at the level of\ntruth conditions. But he didn't think his theory eliminated\nindeterminacy, even quite radical indeterminacy, in word meanings. And\nhe didn't seem bothered by this aspect of the theory; indeed, he thought\nQuine's arguments showed that we shouldn't eliminate this kind of\nindeterminacy.\n\nThis attitude towards Quinean arguments for indeterminacy is obviously a\nstriking contrast to the forcefulness, and rapidity, with which he\nresponded to Putnam's arguments for indeterminacy. That shouldn't be too\nsurprising once we attend to Lewis's threefold distinction between kinds\nof indeterminacy. Quine was arguing that indeterminacy of the third kind\nwas rampant. Putnam was arguing that indeterminacy of the second kind\nwas rampant. And, as Lewis announced in \"Radical Interpretation\", he\nwasn't going to believe any such argument.\n\nStill, we might wonder whether the resources he brought to bear in\nresponding to Putnam also help respond to Quine. Or, perhaps more\nimportantly for exegetical reasons, we might wonder whether Lewis\nthought they were useful in responding to Quine. The evidence from \"New\nWork\" seems to suggest a negative answer to the latter question. Lewis\nnever says that one of the things you can do with the distinction\nbetween natural and unnatural properties is respond to arguments for\nQuinean indeterminacy. And that's despite the fact that \"New Work\" has a\nvery survey-like feel; the bulk of the paper is a long list of\nphilosophical work that a theory of universals can do.\n\nIn \"Putnam's Paradox\" there is a brief footnote on Quine's arguments for\nindeterminacy. It reads\n\n> It is not clear how much indeterminacy might be expected to remain.\n> For instance, what of Quine's famous example? His rabbit-stages,\n> undetached rabbit parts, and rabbit-fusion seem only a little, if any,\n> less eligible than rabbits themselves. [@Lewis1984b 228n]\n\nAs I've stressed repeatedly, following Schwarz, taking the disclaimers\nat the start of \"Putnam's Paradox\" seriously means that we have to be\ncareful in interpreting what Lewis says about how words acquire\ndeterminate meaning in that paper. But even before we adjust for the\ndisclaimers, this is hardly a ringing rejection of Quine's indeterminacy\narguments. The contrast to Lewis's attitude towards Putnam's arguments\nis striking. Since it is the very same contrast that we saw in both\n\"Languages and Language\" and \"Radical Interpretation\", I think it is\nfair to assume that he continued to think Quine's arguments were\nconsiderably stronger than Putnam's.\n\nBut there is, perhaps, a change of view in \"Meaning Without Use\". Here's\nthe problem Lewis addresses at the end of that paper. Let\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$ once again be English as we currently understand it, and\nlet $\\mathcal{L}_3$ be just like English, except that it doesn't assign\nany truth conditions to sentences over a thousand words long.[^7] Do our\nactual linguistic practices manifest a convention of trust in\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$, or trust in $\\mathcal{L}_3$? Lewis argues that it is\nmore like a convention of trust in $\\mathcal{L}_3$. If someone utters a\nvery long sentence, we expect some kind of performance error, at best.\nWe don't, in general, believe what they say. So the theory of \"Languages\nand Language\" seems to predict that these long sentences have no truth\nconditions. But that's wrong, so the theory must be corrected.\n\nLewis's correction appeals, it seems, to natural properties in fixing a\ngrammar. He says that linguistic practice determines truth conditions\nfor a fragment of the language that is widely used. Those truth\nconditions determine meanings of words. This determination requires\nnatural properties; without them the Quinean problems multiply\nindefinitely. We then use those word meanings to determine the meaning\nof unused sentences. A long footnote suggests that the procedure might\nnot be restricted to unused sentences. As long as there is a large\nenough fragment in which there are conventions of truthfulness and\ntrust, we can extrapolate from that to other parts of the language that\nare used.\n\nThis is a marked deviation from anything Lewis had said until then. From\nthe earliest writings, he had stressed a step-by-step approach to\ncontent determination. Behavioural dispositions plus physical and\nbiological constraints determine mental content; mental content\ndetermines sentence meaning; and sentence meaning determines word\nmeaning. In \"Meaning Without Use\", it seemed the last two steps were\nbeing somewhat merged.\n\nBut we shouldn't overstate how much the third step was allowed to\nencroach on the second. Lewis does think we need to rule out 'bent'\ngrammars, which don't assign any truth conditions to sentences over a\nthousand words long, or which give sentences different meanings to what\nwe'd expect if the word 'cabbage' appears forty times. But he doesn't\nthink we need to rule out any 'straight' grammar, which includes \"any\ngrammar that any linguist would actually propose.\" [@Lewis1992a 109]\n\nSo Lewis's focus here is to rule out unnatural *compositional rules*,\nnot unnatural assignments of content to individual words. The reference\nto linguists here might be useful. Linguists tend to spend much more\ntime on compositional rules than they do on the contents on individual\npredicates. Notably, Quine didn't argue for indeterminacy by positing\nindeterminacy in the compositional rules of the language; his\nnon-standard interpretations all share a standard syntax. If we posit\nthat Lewis thought that there was little syntactic indeterminacy in the\nlanguage, like there is little indeterminacy at the level of truth\nconditions of sentences, we can tell a story that doesn't involve too\nmany unsignalled changes of view. Here's how I would tell that story in\nsome more detail.\n\nLewis's early view, expressed clearly in \"Radical Interpretation\" and\n\"Languages and Language\", and not retracted before, I think, 1992, has\nthe following parts:\n\n1.  Conventions of truthfulness and trust determine (very sharply) truth\n    conditions for sentences in a speaker's language.\n\n2.  Any reasonably good grammar, i.e., assignment of word meanings and\n    compositional rules, that is consistent with the truth conditions is\n    not determinately wrong. There is potentially substantial\n    indeterminacy in the meaning of any given word, because there are\n    many reasonably good grammars consistent with the truth conditions.\n\nAfter 1983, 'simplicity' was understood in terms of naturalness, but\notherwise the story doesn't change a lot.\n\nThe later view, which goes by somewhat more quickly in \"Meaning Without\nUse\", has the following parts:\n\n1.  Conventions of truthfulness and trust in (the bulk of) the used\n    fragment of the language determine truth conditions for that\n    fragment.\n\n2.  Naturalness considerations determine the compositional rules for the\n    language by extrapolation from that grammar.\n\n3.  Word meanings are determined, so far as they are determinate, by the\n    truth conditions for sentences, plus the compositional rules.\n\n4.  Truth conditions for sentences outside the used fragment are\n    determined by the word meanings and the compositional rules.\n\nNeither of these views look much like the orthodox view. Remember that\nthe orthodox view has it that considerations of naturalness can be used\nto resolve debates in metaphysics. That's certainly the use that\n@Sider2001-SIDCOP makes of the orthodox view. But on the early view,\nsimplicity considerations only come in after the truth conditions for\nevery sentence have been determined, and hence so that all debates are\nsettled. And on the later view, simplicity considerations primarily are\nused to settle truth conditions for unused, or at least unusual,\nsentences.\n\nNow if you thought the salient fragment in point 1 of the later view was\nsmall, and if you thought naturalness had a major role to play in step 3\nof the later view, you would get back to something like the orthodox\nview. But I don't see the textual evidence for either of those\npositions. Lewis says that \"the used fragment is large and varied.\"\n[@Lewis1992a 110] It doesn't look like he is positing wholesale changes\nto his view on the determination of truth conditions. He is positing\nsome changes; the last two pages of the paper are clearly marked as\ndeviations from his earlier position. But both the examples he uses and\nthe rhetoric around them suggests that the bulk of the changes happen at\npoint 2. Naturalness considerations constraint the syntax of a language\nmuch more tightly than they constrain the assignment of meaning to a\ngiven word. In sum, at no point in the evolution of his views did Lewis\nseem to endorse the orthodox interpretation, even as a theory of word\nmeaning.\n\n### An Argument for the Orthodox Interpretation\n\nSo far I've argued that there is no solid textual support for the\northodox interpretation. My rival interpretation relied on there being a\nconnection between naturalness and induction, and as we've just seen,\nthere is some textual evidence for this. But perhaps there is a more\nindirect way to motivate the orthodox interpretation of Lewis. The\northodox interpretation attributes to Lewis a theory that is quite\nattractive as a theory of semantic determinacy and indeterminacy. Call\nthat theory the **U&N Theory**, short for the **U**se plus\n**N**aturalness theory of meaning. Since Lewis was clearly looking for\nsuch a theory when he discussed naturalness in the context of his theory\nof content, it is reasonably charitable to attribute the **U&N\nTheory** to him, as the orthodox interpretation does.\n\nMy response to this will be in three parts. First, I'll argue in this\nsection that my rival interpretation attributes to Lewis a theory of\nsemantic determinacy and indeterminacy that does just as well at\ncapturing the facts Lewis wanted a theory to capture, so there's no\ncharity based reason to attribute the **U&N Theory** to him (And, as we\nsaw in the previous section, there's no direct textual reason to\nattribute it to him either.) Second, the **U&N Theory** is subject to\nthe criticisms in @Williams2007, while the theory I attribute to Lewis\nis not. Third, the **U** part of the **U&N Theory** is hopelessly vague;\nit isn't clear how to say what 'use' is on a Lewisian theory that makes\nit suitable to add to naturalness to deliver meanings. Either use is so\nthick that naturalness is unneeded, or it is so thin that naturalness\nwon't be sufficient to set meaning. So actually it isn't particularly\ncharitable to attribute this theory to him.\n\nStill, let's start with the attractions of the **U&N Theory**. On the\none hand, agents are inclined to say \"All emeralds are green\" both in\nsituations where they've seen a lot of green emeralds (and no non-green\nones) and in situations where they've seen a lot of grue emeralds (and\nno non-grue ones). That's because, of course, those are exactly the same\nsituations. So at first glance, it doesn't look like the way in which\n\"green\" is used will determine whether it means green or grue. On the\nother hand, once we add a requirement that terms have a relatively\nnatural meaning, we do get this to fall out as a result. Moreover we can\neven see how this falls out of a recognisably Lewisian approach to\nmeaning.\n\nConsider again our agent who says \"All emeralds are green\" after seeing\na lot of emeralds that are both green and grue. And remember that for\nher to speak a language, she must typically conform to conventions of\ntruthfulness and trust in that language. Now if the agent was speaking\n$\\mathcal{L}_2$, she would have to think that she's doing an OK job of\nbeing truthful in $\\mathcal{L}_2$ by saying \"All emeralds are green\".\nBut that would be crazy. Why should she think that all emeralds are grue\ngiven her evidence base? To attribute to her that belief would be to\ngratuitously attribute irrational beliefs to her. And on Lewis's\npicture, gratuitous attributions of irrationality are false. So the\nagent doesn't have that belief. So she's not speaking $\\mathcal{L}_2$.\n\nThings are even clearer from the perspective of hearers. A hearer of\n\"All emeralds are green\" would be completely crazy to come to believe\nthat all emeralds are grue. The hearer knows, after all, that the\nspeaker has no acquaintance with the emeralds that would have to be blue\nfor all emeralds to be grue. So the hearer knows that this utterance\ncould not be sufficient evidence to believe that all emeralds are grue.\nYet if she speaks $\\mathcal{L}_2$, she is disposed to believe that all\nemeralds are grue on hearing \"All emeralds are green\". She isn't\nirrational, or at least we shouldn't assign irrationality to her so\nquickly, so she doesn't speak $\\mathcal{L}_2$.\n\nSo it looks like in this one case at least, we have a case where use\nplus naturalness gives us the right theory. Agents are disposed to use\n\"green\" to describe emeralds that are green/grue. But the fact that\ngreenness is more natural than gruesomeness makes it more appropriate to\nattribute to them a convention according to which \"All emeralds are\ngreen\" means that all emeralds are green and not that all emeralds are\ngrue.\n\nBut more carefully, what we should say is that the **U&N Theory** gives\nus the right result in this case. It doesn't follow that it will work in\nall cases, or anything like it. And it doesn't follow that it works for\nthe right reasons. As we'll see, neither of those claims are true. In\nfact, just re-reading the last three paragraphs should undermine the\nsecond claim. Because we just saw a derivation that the agents are not\nspeaking $\\mathcal{L}_2$, that didn't even appeal to the **U&N Theory**.\nRather, that derivation simply used the theory of meaning in\n*Convention* and the theory of mental content in \"Radical\nInterpretation\". It's true that the latter theory assigns a special role\nto rationality, and the theory of rationality we used has, among other\nthings, a role for natural properties, but that is very different to the\nidea that naturalness feeds directly into the theory of meaning in the\nway the orthodox interpretation says. As I said at the start, I think\nthe best interpretation of Lewis is that he changed his theory of\n*rationality* in 1983, but that's the only change to his theory of\n*meaning*.\n\nPut another way, these reflections on \"green\" and \"grue\" are consistent\nwith the view that the **U&N Theory** is a false *theory*, but a useful\n*heuristic*. It's a useful heuristic because it agrees with the true\nLewisian theory in core cases, and is much easier to apply. That's\nexactly what I think the **U&N Theory** is, both as a matter of fact,\nand as a matter of Lewis interpretation.\n\n### Indeterminacy and Radically Deviant Interpretations\n\nIf the **U&N Theory** is a heuristic not a theory, we should expect that\nit will break down in extreme cases. That's exactly what we see in the\ncases discussed in @Williams2007. Those cases highlight the fact that a\nLewisian theorist needs to be careful that we don't end up concluding\nthat normal people, such as the agent in our example who says \"All\nemeralds are green\", speak $\\mathcal{L}_4$. $\\mathcal{L}_4$ is a\nlanguage in which all sentences express claims about a particular\nmathematical model (essentially a Henkin model of the sentence the agent\naccepts), and it is set up in such a way that ordinary English sentences\ncome out true, and about very natural parts of the model. On the **U&N\nTheory**, it could easily turn out that ordinary speakers are speaking\n$\\mathcal{L}_4$, since the assigned meanings are so natural. We can see\nthis isn't a consequence of *Lewis's* theory by working through the case\nfrom first principles. I have two arguments here, the first of them\nrelying on some slightly contentious claims about the epistemology of\nmathematics, the second less contentious.\n\nAssume, for reductio, that ordinary speakers are speaking\n$\\mathcal{L}_4$. So, for instance, when O'Leary says \"The beer is in the\nfridge\", what he says is that a certain complicated mathematical model\nhas a certain property. (And indeed it has that property.) Now this\nwon't be a particularly rational thing for O'Leary to say unless he\nknows more mathematics than ordinary folks like him ordinarily do. So if\nO'Leary has adopted a convention of truthfulness and trust in\n$\\mathcal{L}_4$, then uttering \"The beer is in the fridge\" would be\nirrational, even if he is standing in front of the open fridge, looking\nat the beer. That's a gratuitous assignment of irrationality, and\ngratuitous assignments of irrationality are false, so O'Leary doesn't\nspeak $\\mathcal{L}_4$.\n\nPerhaps that is too quick. After all, the mathematical claim that\n$\\mathcal{L}_4$ associates with \"The beer is in the fridge\" is a\nnecessary truth. And Lewis's theory of content is intentional, not\nhyper-intentional. So O'Leary does know it is true. (And when he is\nstanding in front of the fridge, there's even a sense that he knows that\n\"The beer is in the fridge\" expresses a truth, if $\\mathcal{L}_4$ is\nreally his language.) I think that's probably not the right sense of\n\"rational\", and I'm not altogether sure how much hostility to\nhyper-intensionalism we should attribute to Lewis. But so as to avoid\nthese questions, it's easier to consider a different argument that\nfocusses attention on O'Leary's audience.\n\nWhen O'Leary says \"The beer is in the fridge\", Daniels hears him, and\nthen walks to the fridge. Why does Daniels make such a walk? Well, he\nwants beer, and believes it is in the fridge. That looks like a nice\nrational explanation. But why does he believe the beer is in the fridge?\nI say it's because he's (rationally) adopted a convention of\ntruthfulness and trust in $\\mathcal{L}_1$, and so he rationally comes to\nbelieve the beer is in the fridge when O'Leary says \"The beer is in the\nfridge\". On the assumption that O'Leary and Daniels speak\n$\\mathcal{L}_4$, none of this story goes through. But we must have some\nrational explanation of why O'Leary's statement makes Daniels walk to\nthe fridge. So O'Leary and Daniels must not be speaking $\\mathcal{L}_4$.\n\nMichael Morreau pointed out (when I presented this talk at CSMN) that\nthe preceding argument may be too quick. Perhaps there is a way of\nrationalising Daniels's actions upon hearing O'Leary's words consistent\nwith the idea that they both speak $\\mathcal{L}_4$. Perhaps, for\ninstance, Daniels's walking to the fridge constitutes saying something\nin a complicated sign language, and that thing is the rational reply to\nwhat O'Leary said. If this kind of response works, and I have no reason\nto think it won't, the solution is to increase the costs to Daniels of\nperforming such a reply. For instance, not too long ago I heard Mayor\nBloomberg say \"Lower Manhattan is being evacuated because of the\nimpending hurricane\", and I (and my family) packed up and evacuated from\nLower Manhattan. Even if one could find an interpretation of our actions\nin evacuating that made them constitute the assertion of a sensible\nreply to Bloomberg's mathematical assertion in $\\mathcal{L}_4$, it would\nbe irrational to think I made such an assertion. Evacuating ahead of a\nstorm with an infant is not fun - if it was that hard to make\nmathematical assertions, I wouldn't make them! And I certainly wouldn't\nmake them in reply to someone who wouldn't even see my gestures. So I\nthink at least some of the actions that are rationalised by testimony,\ninterpreted as sentences of $\\mathcal{L}_1$, are not rationalised by\ntestimony, interpreted as $\\mathcal{L}_4$. By the kind of appeal to the\nprinciple of charity we have used a lot already, that means that\n$\\mathcal{L}_4$ is not the language most people speak.\n\nThe central point here is that when we are ruling out particularly\ndeviant interpretations of some speakers, we have to make heavy use of\nthe requirement that the interpretation of their shared language\nrationalises what they do. In part that means it must rationalise why\nthey utter the strings that they do in fact utter. And when we're\nconsidering this, we should remember the role of naturalness in a theory\nof rationality. But it also means that it must rationalise why people\nrespond to various strings with non-linguistic actions, such as walking\nto the fridge, or evacuating Lower Manhattan. Naturalness has less of a\nrole to play here, but the Lewisian theory still gets the right answers\nprovided we apply it carefully. Since the Lewisian theory gets the right\nanswers, and the **U&N Theory** gets the wrong answers, it follows that\nthe **U&N Theory** isn't Lewis's theory, and so orthodoxy is wrong.\n\n### What is the Use of a Predicate?\n\nWe concluded the last section with an argument that Lewis isn't\nvulnerable to the claim that his theory assigns complicated mathematical\nclaims as the meanings of ordinary English sentences. That\ninterpretation, we argued, is inconsistent with the way those sentences\nare used. In particular, it is inconsistent with the way that *hearers*\nuse sentences to guide their actions.\n\nSo far so good, we might think. But notice how much has been packed into\nthe notion of use to get us this far. In identifying the use O'Leary\nmakes of \"The beer is in the fridge\", we have to say a lot about\nO'Leary's beliefs and desires. And in identifying the use Daniels makes\nof it, we *primarily* talk about the sentence's effects on Daniels's\nbeliefs and desires. That is, just saying how the sentence is used\nrequires saying a lot about mental states of speakers. And that will\noften require appealing to constitutive rationality; we say that\nDaniels's beliefs about the fridge changed because we need to\nrationalise his fridge-directed behaviour.\n\nAnd this should all make us suspicious about the prospects for\nidentifying meaning (in a Lewisian theory) with use plus naturalness.\nThe argument above that naturalness mattered to meaning relied on the\nidea that naturalness matters because it affects which states are\nrational, and hence which states are actualised. A belief that all\nemeralds are grue is unnatural, so it is hard to hold. And since it is\nhard to hold, it is hard to think one is conforming to a convention of\ntruthfulness in a language if one utters sentences that mean, in that\nlanguage, that all emeralds are grue. That's why it is wrong, *ceteris\nparibus,* to interpret people as speaking about grueness.\n\nBut now consider what happened when we were talking about Daniels and\nO'Leary. Even to say how they were using the sentence \"The beer is in\nthe fridge\", we had to say what they believed before and after the\nsentence was uttered. In other words, their mental states were\nconstitutive of the way the sentence was used. Now add in the extra\npremise, argued for above, that naturalness matters to Lewis's theory of\nlinguistic content because, and only because, it matters to his theory\nof mental content. (And it only matters to mental content because it\nmatters to the principle of charity that Lewis uses.) If mental states,\nand their changes, are part of how the sentences are used, it will be\nrather misleading to say that meaning is determined by use plus\nnaturalness. A better thing to say is that meaning is determined by use,\nand that some key parts of use, i.e., mental states of speakers and\nhearers, are determined in part by naturalness.\n\nSo I'm sceptical of the **U&N Theory**. We can put the argument of the\nlast few paragraphs as a dilemma. There are richer and thinner ways of\nidentifying the use to which a sentence is put. A thin way might, for\ninstance, just focus on the observable state of the part of the physical\nworld in which the sentence is uttered. A rich way might include\ninclude, inter alia, the use that is made of the sentence in the\nmanagement of belief and the generation of rational action. If we adopt\nthe thin way of thinking about use, then adding naturalness won't be\nenough to say what makes it the case that O'Leary and Daniels are\nspeaking $\\mathcal{L}_1$ rather than $\\mathcal{L}_4$. If we adopt the\nrich way of thinking about use, then the role that naturalness plays in\nthe theory of meaning has been incorporated into the metaphysics of use.\nNeither way makes the **U&N Theory** true while assigning naturalness an\nindependent role. This dilemma isn't just an argument that we shouldn't\nattribute the **U&N Theory** to Lewis; it is an argument against anyone\nadopting that theory.\n\n### From Theory to Applied Semantics\n\nSo far we've argued that Lewis's semantic theory did not look a lot like\nthe orthodox interpretation. It's true that he thought the way a\nsentence was used was of primary importance in determining its meaning.\nAnd it's true that he thought naturalness mattered to meaning. But that\nwasn't because naturalness came in to resolve the indeterminacy left in\na use-based theory of meaning. Rather, it was because naturalness was in\na part of the theory of mental content, and specifying the mental states\nof speakers and hearers is part of specifying how the sentence is used.\n\nBut note that these considerations apply primarily to investigations at\na very high level of generality, such as when we're trying to solve the\nproblems described in \"Radical Interpretation\". They don't apply to\ninvestigations into applied semantics. Let's say we are trying to figure\nout what O'Leary and Daniels mean by \"green\". And assume that we are\ntaking for granted that they are speaking a language which is, in most\nrespects, like English. This is hardly unusual in ordinary work in\napplied semantics. If we are writing a paper on the semantics of colour\nterms, a paper like, say, \"Naming the Colours\", we don't concern\nourselves with the possibility that every sentence in the language\nrefers to some complicated mathematical claim or other.\n\nNow given those assumptions, we can identify a moderately thin notion of\nuse. We know that O'Leary uses \"green\" to describe things that are, by\nappearance, both green and grue. We also know that when O'Leary makes\nsuch a description, Daniels expects the object will be both green and\ngrue. So focus on a notion of use such that the *use* of a predicate\njust is a function of which objects speakers will typically apply the\npredicate to, and which properties hearers take those objects to have\nonce they hear the predication. If we wanted to be more precise, we\ncould call this notion of 'use' simply *predication*. When we are doing\napplied semantics, especially when we are trying to figure out the\nmeaning of predicates, we typically know which objects a speaker is\ndisposed to predicate a predicate of, and that's the salient feature of\nuse. (This is why I said the most accurate heuristic would be meaning is\npredication plus naturalness; predication is the bit of use we care\nabout in this context.)\n\nThis identification of use wouldn't make any sense if we were engaged in\ntheorising at a much more abstract level. If we are doing radical\ninterpretation, then we have to take non-semantic inputs, and solve\nsimultaneously for the values of the subject term and the predicate term\nin a (simple) sentence. But when we are just doing applied semantics,\nand working just on the meaning of a term like \"green\" in a\nwell-functioning language, we can presuppose facts about the denotation\nof the subject term in sentences like *S is green*, and presuppose facts\nabout what is the subject and what is the predicate in that sentence,\nand then we can look at which properties hearers come to associate with\nthat very object on hearing that sentence.\n\nNow that we have a notion of use that's distinct from naturalness, we\ncan ask whether it is plausible that predicate meaning is use (in that\nsense) plus naturalness. And, quite plausibly, the answer is yes. The\narguments in @Sider2001-SIDCOP and @Weatherson2003-WEAWGA in favour of\nthis theory look like, at the very least, good arguments that the theory\ndoes the right job in resolving Kripkensteinian problems. The theory is\nimmune to objections based on radical re-interpretations of the\nlanguage, as in @Williams2007, because those will be inconsistent with\nthe use so defined. And the theory fits nicely into Lewis's broader\ntheory of meaning, i.e., his metasemantics, which is in turn well\nmotivated. So I think there are good reasons to hold that when we're\ndoing applied semantics, the **U&N Theory** delivers the right verdicts,\nand delivers them for Lewisian reasons. That's the heart of what's true\nabout the **U&N Theory**, even if it isn't a fully general theory of\nmeaning.\n\n[^2]: @Holton2003Lewis is more nuanced, but does tell a similar story in\n    the context of discussing Lewis's account of (potential) semantic\n    indeterminacy. @Weatherson2010-VaI follows Holton in this respect.\n\n[^3]: As some further evidence for how orthodox the 'orthodox'\n    interpretation is, note that @Williams2007 is a prize winning essay\n    published with two commentaries in the *Philosophical Review*. That\n    paper takes the orthodox interpretation as its starting point, and\n    neither of the commentaries (@Bays2007 and @Hawthorne2007) criticise\n    this starting point.\n\n[^4]: @Schwarz2006 develops his criticism of orthodoxy in more detail,\n    and in English, but it is as yet unpublished.\n\n[^5]: These points are stressed by Wolfgang @Schwarz2006 [@Schwarz2009].\n    He also notes that in \"Putnam's Paradox\" Lewis explicitly sets these\n    parts of his theory aside so he can discuss Putnam's arguments on\n    grounds most favourable to Putnam. As Schwarz says, this should make\n    us suspicious of the central role \"Putnam's Paradox\" plays in\n    defences of the orthodox interpretation. We will return to this\n    point in the section on textual evidence for and against orthodoxy.\n\n    A referee notes, correctly, that the phrase 'in the first instance'\n    is doing a lot of work here. That's right; we'll return in much more\n    detail below to Lewisian theories of word meaning, and what role\n    naturalness plays in them.\n\n[^6]: The view I'm attributing to Lewis is endorsed by one prominent\n    supporter of the orthodox interpretation, namely Ted Sider. See his\n    [-@Sider2012 35ff].\n\n[^7]: If you think sentences with a thousand words are too easy to\n    understand for the argument of this paragraph, make the threshold\n    higher; as long as the threshold is finite, it won't affect the\n    argument.\n",
