There isn't as much discussion as there should be on how different problems impact one another. This paper aims to bring together work on problems involving demons, problems about attitudes to risk, problems about incomplete preferences, and problems about dynamic choice. In the first three of these cases, I end up defending a pre-existing view, but in each case the argument for that view is strengthened by seeing how the premises that support it are essential to solving one of the other problems. The most novel part of the view is the theory of dynamic choice that I offer: a sequence of choices is rational only if both the so-called 'resolute' and 'sophisticated' theories of dynamic choice would permit it. This theory would be implausible if paired with many rival solutions to the first three problems, but fits nicely with the view I'll develop through the paper that decision theory is much less constraining than most theorists hold.\ndate: March 5 2024\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ncitation: false\ncategories:\n  - games and decisions\n  - unpublished\nformat:\n  html: default\n  docx: default\n  pdf:\n    output-file: \"Four Problems in Decision Theory\"\n    include-after-body: \n      text: |\n         Unpublished. Posted online in 2024.\n---\n\n\n\nContemporary decision theory has become disjointed. There is less overlap than there should be in work on adjacent problems. This paper aims to undo some of that, by showing that four problems that have largely been worked on in isolation cast useful light on each other. In particular, I'll argue that we can go a long way towards solving all four problems by working through the consequences of a plausible principle that I'll call the Single Choice Principle.\n\nThe Single Choice Principle (hereafter, SCP) relates theories of static choice and dynamic choice. In particular, it says that for a narrow class of games, it doesn't matter whether you think of the game as involving a static, strategic choice, or a dynamic choice that is made during a game. One way into the principle is to think about an oddity in the way Newcomb's Problem is normally introduced.\n\nIn the standard vignette that goes with Newcomb's Problem, it is a dynamic game. The demon makes a *prediction*, and then the human (hereafter, Chooser) makes a choice. Chooser doesn't know what Demon did, but they do know that Demon has acted. So the natural presentation of Newcomb's Problem is in a tree like @fig-standard-newcomb.\n\n:::{.column-screen-right}\n\n::::{layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Newcomb's Problem.](four-problems-march-25-2024_files/figure-docx/fig-standard-newcomb-1.png){#fig-standard-newcomb}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n|       |       P1      |     P2     |\n|:-----:|:-------------:|:----------:|\n|  1    |     1000      |     0      |\n|  2    |     1001      |     1      |\n\n: Newcomb's Problem {#tbl-standard-newcomb}\n::::\n\n:::\n\nI'll go over the details of how to read diagrams like @fig-standard-newcomb in [insert cross-ref here!]. All you need to know for now is that the game starts at the open node, here at the top, and it moves along by the agent (Demon or Chooser) making choices. The dotted lines around the two nodes where Chooser acts mean that those two nodes are in the same **information set**. That is, when Chooser is at either one of those nodes, the strongest thing Chooser knows is that they are somewhere or other in the set.^[This formalism only really makes sense if we presuppose the right epistemic logic is S5, and there are good reasons to not make that assumption in general [@Humberstone2016 380-402]. For this paper we'll treat it as a simplifying assumption that really should be relaxed in subsequent work.]\n\n\n\n",
