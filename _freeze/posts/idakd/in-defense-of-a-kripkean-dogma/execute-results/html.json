We will argue three things in reply. First, the\nexperiments in question---concerning Kripke's Gödel/Schmidt\nexample---don't really speak to the dispute between descriptivism and\nthe causal-historical theory; though the two theories are empirically\ntestable, we need to look at quite different data than MMNS do to decide\nbetween them. Second, the Gödel/Schmidt example plays a different, and\nmuch smaller, role in Kripke's argument for the causal-historical theory\nthan MMNS assume. Finally, and relatedly, even if Kripke *is* wrong\nabout the Gödel/Schmidt example---indeed, even if the causal-historical\ntheory is not the correct theory of names for some human\nlanguages---that does not, contrary to MMNS's claim, undermine uses of\nthe causal-historical theory in philosophical research projects.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Philosophy and Phenomenological Research_ 85: 56-68.\n</aside>\n\n### Experiments and Reference\n\nMMNS start with some by now famous experiments concerning reference and\nmistaken identity. The one they focus on, and which we'll focus on too,\nis a variant of Kripke's Gödel/Schmidt example. Here is the question\nthey gave to subjects.\n\n> Suppose that John has learned in college that Gödel is the man who\n> proved an important mathematical theorem, called the incompleteness of\n> arithmetic. John is quite good at mathematics and he can give an\n> accurate statement of the incompleteness theorem, which he attributes\n> to Gödel as the discoverer. But this is the only thing that he has\n> heard about Gödel. Now suppose that Gödel was not the author of this\n> theorem. A man called \"Schmidt\" whose body was found in Vienna under\n> mysterious circumstances many years ago, actually did the work in\n> question. His friend Gödel somehow got hold of the manuscript and\n> claimed credit for the work, which was thereafter attributed to Gödel.\n> Thus he has been known as the man who proved the incompleteness of\n> arithmetic. Most people who have heard the name 'Gödel' are like John;\n> the claim that Gödel discovered the incompleteness theorem is the only\n> thing they have ever heard about Gödel. When John uses the name\n> 'Gödel,' is he talking about:\n>\n> 1.  the person who really discovered the incompleteness of arithmetic?\n>     or\n>\n> 2.  the person who got hold of the manuscript and claimed credit for\n>     the work? (MMNS 2009: 341)\n\nThe striking result is that while a majority of American subjects answer\n(B), consistently with Kripke's causal-historical theory of names, the\nmajority of Chinese subjects answer (A).[^1] To the extent that Kripke's\ntheory is motivated by the universality of intuitions in favour of his\ntheory in cases like this one, Kripke's theory is undermined.\n\nThere are now a number of challenges to this argument in the literature.\nBefore developing our own challenge, we'll briefly note five extant\nones, which all strike us as at least approximately correct.\n\nKripke's theory is a theory of *semantic* reference. When asked who John\nis talking about, it is natural that many subjects will take this to be\na question about *speaker* reference. And nothing in Kripke's theory\ndenies that *John* might refer to the person who proved the\nincompleteness of arithmetic, even if his word refers to someone else.\n[@Ludwig2007; @Deutsch2009]\n\nKripke's argument relies on the *fact* that '\n\nGödel' refers to Gödel, not to the universality or otherwise of\nintuitions about what it refers to. That some experimental subjects\ndon't appreciate this fact doesn't make it any less of a fact.\n[@Deutsch2009]\n\nIf the subjects genuinely were descriptivists, it isn't clear how they\ncould make sense of the vignette, since the name 'Gödel' is frequently\nused in the vignette itself to refer to the causal origin of that name,\nnot to the prover of the incompleteness or arithmetic.\n\n[^2]\n\nOn a related point, Martí doesn't mention this, but subjects who aren't\ndescriptivists should also object to the vignette, since in the story\nJohn doesn't learn Gödel proved the incompleteness of arithmetic, at\nleast not if 'learn' is factive. [@Marti2009]\n\nThe experiment asks subjects for their judgments about a metalinguistic,\nand hence somewhat theoretical, question about the mechanics of\nreference. It's better practice to observe how people actually refer,\nrather than asking them what they think about reference.\n[@Marti2009; @Devitt2010]\n\nIntuitions about the Gödel/Schmidt case play at best a limited role in\nKripke's broader arguments, so experimental data undermining their\nregularity do not cast serious doubt on Kripke's theory of reference.\n[@Devitt2010]\n\nWe think challenges (1)-(3) work. Something like (4) should work too,\nalthough it requires some qualification. Consider, for instance, what\nhappens in syntax. It's true, of course, that we don't go around asking\nordinary speakers whether they think *Lectures on Government and\nBinding* was an advance over *Aspects*. Or, if we did, we wouldn't think\nit had much evidential value. But that's not because ordinary speaker\njudgments are irrelevant to syntax. On the contrary, judgments about\nwhether particular strings constitute well-formed sentences are an\nimportant part of our evidence.[^3] But they are not our only evidence,\nor even our primary evidence; we also use corpus data about which words\nand phrases are actually used, and many syntacticians take such usage\nevidence to trump evidence from metasemantic intuitions.[^4] Even when\nwe do seek such intuitive answers, perhaps because there isn't enough\ncorpus data to settle the usage issue, the questions might be about\ncases that are quite different to the cases we primarily care about. So\nwe might ask a lot about speakers' judgments concerning questions even\nif we care primarily about the syntax of declarative sentences.\n\nIf what @Kripke1980 says in *Naming and Necessity* (hereafter, NN) is\nright, then we should expect something similar in the case of reference.\nKripke anticipates that some people will disagree with him about some of\nthe examples, and offers a few replies. (Our discussion here largely\ndraws on footnote 36 of NN.) Part of his reply is a version of point 1\nabove; those disagreements may well be over speaker reference, not\nsemantic reference. That reply is correct; it's hard for us to hear a\nquestion about who someone is talking about as anything but a question\nabout speaker reference. He goes on to note that his theory makes\nempirical predictions about how names are used.\n\n> If I mistake Jones for Smith, I may *refer* (in an appropriate sense)\n> to Jones when I say that Smith is raking the leaves ... Similarly, if\n> I erroneously think that Aristotle wrote such-and-such passage, I may\n> perhaps sometimes use 'Aristotle' to *refer* to the actual author of\n> the passage ... In both cases, I will withdraw my original statement,\n> and my original use of the name, if apprised of the facts. (NN 86n)\n\nThis seems entirely right. There's some sense in which John, in MMNS's\nvignette, is referring to\n\nGödel and some sense in which he's referring to Schmidt. Just thinking\nabout the particular utterance he makes using 'Gödel' won't help much in\nteasing apart speaker reference and semantic reference. What we should\nlook to are patterns of---or if they're not available, intuitions\nabout---withdrawals of statements containing disputed names. To use the\nexample Kripke gives here, consider a speaker who (a) associates with\nthe name 'Aristotle' only the description 'the author of *The\nRepublic*', (b) truly believes that a particular passage in *The\nRepublic* contains a quantifier scope fallacy, and (c) is a\ndescriptivist. She might say \"Aristotle commits a quantifier scope\nfallacy in this passage.\" When she's informed that the passage was\nwritten by Plato, she'll no longer utter those very words, but she'll\nstill insist that the sentence she uttered was literally true. That's\nbecause she'll claim that in that sentence 'Aristotle' just referred to\nthe author of the passage, and that person did commit a quantifier scope\nfallacy. A non-descriptivist will take back the claim expressed, though\nshe might insist that what she *intended* to say was true.\n\nSo to show that subjects in different parts of the world really have\ndescriptivist intuitions about the Gödel/Schmidt case, we might ask\nabout whether they think John should withdraw, or clarify, his earlier\nstatements if apprised of the facts. Or we might ask whether they would\nwithdraw, or clarify, similar statements they had made if apprised of\nthe facts. Or, even better, we might test whether in practice people in\ndifferent parts of the world really do withdraw their prior claims at\ndifferent rates when apprised of the facts about a Gödel/Schmidt case.\nKripke is right that given descriptivism, a speaker shouldn't feel\nobliged to withdraw the original statement when apprised of the facts,\nbut given the causal-historical theory, they should. So there are\nexperiments that we could run which would discriminate between\ndescriptivist and causal-historical approaches, but we don't think the\nactual experiment MMNS run does so.\n\nIn its broad terms, we agree with Devitt's challenge (5), although we\nunderstand the role of the Gödel/Schmidt case rather differently than he\ndoes. We turn now to this question.\n\n### Gödel's Role in Naming and Necessity\n\nIn the first section we argued that the experimental data MMNS offer do\nnot show that the correct account of the Gödel/Schmidt example is\ndifferent in different dialects. In this section we want to argue that\nthere's very little one *could* show about the Gödel/Schmidt example\nthat would bear on the broader question of what the correct theory of\nreference is. To see this, let's review where the Gödel/Schmidt example\ncomes up in *Naming and Necessity*.\n\nIn the first lecture, Kripke argues, via the modal argument, that names\ncan't be synonymous with descriptions. The reason is that in modal\ncontexts, substituting a name for an individuating description alters\ntruth values. So a pure descriptivism that treats names and descriptions\nas synonymous is off the table. What's left, thinks Kripke, is what\nSoames calls \"weak descriptivism\" [@Soames2003 Volume II, 356]. This is\nthe view that although names are not synonymous with descriptions, and\ndo not abbreviate descriptions, they do have their reference fixed by\ndescriptions.\n\nHere is the way Kripke introduces the picture that he is attacking.\n\n> The picture is this. I want to name an object. I think of some way of\n> describing it uniquely and then I go through, so to speak, a sort of\n> mental ceremony: By 'Cicero' I shall mean the man who denounced\n> Cataline ... [M]y intentions are given by first, giving some\n> condition which uniquely determines an object, then using a certain\n> word as a name for the object determined by this condition. (NN 79)\n\nThe Gödel/Schmidt example, or at least the version of it that MMNS\ndiscuss, comes up in Kripke's attack on one of the consequences of this\npicture of naming. (A variant on the example, where no one proves the\nincompleteness of arithmetic, is used to attack another consequence of\nthe theory.) So the role of the Gödel/Schmidt example is to undermine\nthis picture of names and naming.\n\nBut note that it is far from the only attack on this picture. Indeed, it\nis not even the first attack. Kripke's first argument is that for most\nnames, most users of the name cannot give an individuating description\nof the bearer of the name. In fact, those users cannot even give a\ndescription of the bearer that is individuating *by their own lights*.\nThe best they can do for 'Cicero' is 'a Roman orator' and the best they\ncan do for 'Feynman' is 'a famous physicist'. (NN 81) But it isn't that\nthese users think that there was only one Roman orator, or that there is\nonly one famous physicist. It's just that they don't know any more about\nthe bearers of these names they possess. The important point here is\nthat Kripke starts with some examples where the best description a\nspeaker can associate with a name is a description that isn't\nindividuating *even by the speakers' own lights*. And he thinks that\ndescriptivists can't explain how names work in these cases.\n\nNow perhaps we'll get new experimental evidence that even in these\ncases, some experimental subjects have descriptivist intuitions. Some\npeople might intuit that if a speaker does not know of any property that\ndistinguishes Feynman from Gell-Mann, their name 'Feynman' is\nindeterminate in reference between Feynman from Gell-Mann. We're not\nsure what such an experiment would tell us about the metaphysics of\nreference, but maybe someone could try undermining Kripke's argument\nthis way. But that's not what MMNS found; their experiments don't bear\non what Kripke says about 'Feynman', and hence don't bear on his primary\nargument against weak descriptivism.\n\nSome philosophers will hold that although the picture Kripke describes\nhere, i.e., weak descriptivism, can't be right in general for\nFeynman/Gell-Mann reasons, it could be true in some special cases. We\nagree. So does Kripke. The very next sentence after the passage quoted\nabove says, \"Now there may be some cases in which we actually do this.\"\n(NN 79) And he proceeds to describe three real life cases (concerning\n'Hesperus', 'Jack the Ripper' and 'Neptune') where the picture is\nplausibly correct. But he thinks these cases are rare. In particular, we\nshouldn't think that the existence of an individuating description is\nsufficient reason to believe that we are in such a case. That, at last,\nis the point of the Gödel/Schmidt example. His conclusion from that\nexample is that weak descriptivism isn't correct even in those special\ncases of names where the speaker possesses a description that she\n*takes* to be individuating.[^5]\n\nMichael @Devitt2010 also argues that MMNS exaggerate the importance of\nthe Gödel/Schmidt case. He identifies a number of Kripke's other\narguments (including the Feynman one we mention) that he takes to be\nmore central, and, like us, he argues that MMNS's results do not cast\ndoubt on these arguments. We agree, noting only two points of\ndifference. First, as suggested above, although the Gödel/Schmidt case\nis not the only or the most central motivation for Kripke's theory of\nreference, we do think that it plays a distinctive role, compared with\nthat of, for instance, the Feynman case. It refutes even the weak\nversion of weak descriptivism according to which, in the special case in\nwhich subjects do possess individuating descriptions, those descriptions\ndetermine reference. We think the Gödel/Schmidt case (together with the\nPeano/Dedekind case) form the basis of the only argument in *Naming and\nNecessity* against this weak weak descriptivism. (On a closely related\npoint, we, unlike Devitt, take the Gödel/Schmidt case to be addressing a\nquantitative question about how common descriptive names are, not the\nqualitative question about whether the causal-historical theory is true\nat all; we'll expand on this point below.) Second, Devitt expresses some\nscepticism about the Gödel/Schmidt judgment on the grounds that the\nrelevant case is somewhat 'fanciful'---actual cases, Devitt suggests,\nare better to be trusted. While there is surely some truth in the\nsuggestion that intuitions about esoteric and complicated cases can be\nless trustworthy than those about everyday ones, we see little reason\nfor concern in this instance; the Gödel case does not describe a\nscenario we should expect to find trouble thinking about.\n\nOur reconstruction of the structure of Kripke's argument should make it\nclear how *unimportant* the Gödel/Schmidt example is to the broader\ntheoretical questions. If Kripke were wrong about the Gödel/Schmidt\ncase, that would at most show that there are a few more descriptive\nnames than we thought there were. But since the existence of some\ndescriptive names is consistent with the causal-historical theory of\nreference, the existence of a few more is too. All the Gödel/Schmidt\nexample is used for in *Naming and Necessity* is to show that the number\nof descriptive names in English is not just small, it is *very* small.\nBut the truth of the causal-historical theory of reference doesn't turn\non whether there are few descriptive names, or very few descriptive\nnames.\n\nOnce we see that the Gödel/Schmidt example concerns a quantitative\nquestion (are descriptive names rare or very rare?) rather than a\nqualitative question (is the causal-historical theory correct?), we can\nsee some limitations of the experiment MMNS rely on. The case that MMNS\ndescribes to their subjects has several distinctive features, and it\nisn't clear that we'd be justified in drawing conclusions from it about\ncases that lack those features. Here is one such feature. The subject of\nthe vignette (John) acquires the name 'Gödel' at the same time as he\nacquires an individuating description of Gödel. Suppose it turned out\nthat, in some dialects at least, that would be sufficient for the name\nto be a descriptive name; i.e., for it to be a name whose reference is\nfixed by a description somehow attached to that name. If this conjecture\nis true, then descriptive names are a little more common than Kripke\nthinks they are, but not a lot more common. Now we don't actually think\nthis conjecture is true. And for the reasons given in section 1 we don't\nthink this experiment is evidence for it. What we do think is that (a)\nit's hard to see how studying reactions to cases like the Gödel/Schmidt\nexample could show more than that some such claim about the prevalence\nof descriptive names is true, and (b) such claims are not inconsistent\nwith the causal-historical theory.\n\nWe've argued that even if Kripke is wrong about the Gödel/Schmidt\nexample, that doesn't undermine the arguments for the main conclusions\nof *Naming and Necessity*. A natural inference from this is that\nexperiments about the Gödel/Schmidt example can't undermine those\nconclusions. We think the natural inference is correct. A referee has\nsuggested that this is too quick. After all, if we have experimental\nevidence that Kripke is wrong about the Gödel/Schmidt case, we might\nhave some grounds for suspicion about the other cases that Kripke uses\nin the arguments for more central conclusions. That is, if MMNS are\nright about the Gödel/Schmidt case, that doesn't give us a *deductive*\nargument against the other anti-descriptivist moves, but it might give\nus an *inductive* argument against them. This is an important worry, but\nwe think it can be adequately responded to.\n\nThe first thing to note is that it would be foolish to fall back to a\ngeneral scepticism about human judgment just because people disagree in\ntheir intuitive reactions to some tricky cases. This point is well\nargued by Timothy Williamson in his [-@Williamson2007-WILTPO-17 Ch. 6].\nIf there's a worry here, it must be because the evidence about the\nGödel/Schmidt example supports a more modest generalisation about\njudgments about cases, but that generalisation is nevertheless strong\nenough to undermine Kripke's other arguments. We doubt such a\ngeneralisation exists.\n\nIt can't be that the experiments about the Gödel/Schmidt example show\nthat intuitive judgments about reference are systematically mistaken.\nMost of our intuitions in this field are surely correct. For instance,\nour intuitions that 'Kripke' refers to Kripke and not Obama, and that\n'Obama' refers to Obama and not Kripke, are correct. (And experiments\nlike the ones MMNS ran don't give us any reason at all to doubt that.)\nAnd we could produce many more examples like that. At most, the\nexperiments can show us that there are spots of inaccuracy in a larger\npool of correct judgments.\n\nIt might be argued that we should be sceptical of intuitions about\nreference in counterfactual cases. The correct judgments cited in the\nprevious paragraph are all about real cases, but the Gödel/Schmidt\nexample is not a real case. Now we don't think that the experiments do\nundermine all intuitions about reference in counterfactual cases, but\neven if they did, that wouldn't affect the Kripkean argument. That's\nbecause the central argument against descriptivism at the start of\nLecture II involves real cases. The heavy lifting is done by cases where\nspeakers don't think they have an individuating description to go along\nwith names they use (e.g., 'Feynman' and 'Gell-Mann'), or they believe\nthey have an individuating description, but that description involves\nsome kind of circularity (e.g., 'Einstein', 'Cicero'). It seems to us\nthat these cases are much more like the cases where we know people have\naccurate intuitions about reference (e.g., 'Obama' refers to Obama),\nthan they are like cases where there is some dispute about their\naccuracy (e.g., 'Gödel' would refer to Gödel even if Schmidt had proved\nthe incompleteness of arithmetic). So there's no reason to doubt the\nintuitions that underlie these central Kripkean arguments. And so\nthere's no reason from these experiments to doubt the anti-descriptivist\nconclusions Kripke draws from them.\n\n### Reference in Philosophy\n\nIf the data about the Gödel/Schmidt example don't undermine the\ncausal-historical theory of reference, then presumably they don't\nundermine philosophical uses of that theory. But we think MMNS overstate\nthe role that theories of reference play in philosophical theorising,\nand we'll end by saying something about this.\n\nOne simple reaction to MMNS's argument is to say that at most they show\nthat the causal-historical theory of reference is not true of some\ndialects. But, a philosopher might say, they are not writing in such a\ndialect, and the causal-historical theory is true of their dialect. And\nthat's all they needed for their argument. MMNS anticipate this\nobjection, and reply to it in section 3.3 of their paper. The reply is,\nin essence, that such a picture would make a mess of communication. If\nwe posit dialectical variation to explain different reactions to the\nGödel/Schmidt example, and to other examples, then we cannot know what\ndialect someone is speaking without knowing how they respond to these\nexamples. And plainly we don't need to quiz people in detail about\nphilosophical examples in order to communicate with them.\n\nWe offer three replies.\n\nFirst, at least one of us is on record raising in principle suspicions\nabout this kind of argument @Maitra2007. The take-home message from that\npaper is that communication is a lot easier than many theorists have\nsupposed, and requires much less pre-communicative agreement. It seems\nto us that the reply MMNS offer here is susceptible to the arguments in\nthat paper, but for reasons of space we won't rehearse those arguments\nin detail.\n\nSecond, it's one thing to think that variation in *reference* between\ndialects leads to communication breakdown, it's another thing altogether\nto think that variation in *meta-semantics* leads to such breakdown. A\nlittle fable helps make this clear. In some parts of Melbourne, 'Gödel'\nrefers to Gödel because of the causal chains between the users of the\nname and the great mathematician. In other parts, 'Gödel' refers to\nGödel because the speakers use it as a descriptive name, associated with\nthe description 'the man who proved the incompleteness of arithmetic'.\nKevin doesn't know which area he is in when he sees a plaque over a door\nsaying \"Gödel lived here\". It seems to us that Kevin can understand the\nsign completely without knowing how 'Gödel' got its reference. Indeed,\nhe even knows what proposition the sign expresses. So meta-semantic\nvariation between dialects need not lead to communicative failure, even\nwhen hearers don't know which dialect is being used.\n\nThird, if MMNS's argument succeeds, it seems to us that it shows\ndescriptivist theories, including the weak weak descriptivism that\nKripke is arguing against with the Gödel/Schmidt example, are doomed.\n(The arguments in this paragraph are not original. Similar arguments are\nused frequently in, e.g., @FodorLepore1992.) It's a platitude that\ndifferent people know different things. Barring a miracle, that means\ndifferent people will associate different descriptions with different\nnames. If there is widespread use of descriptive names, that means there\nwill be widespread differences in which descriptions are associated with\nwhich names. And that will produce at least as much communicative\ndifficulty as having some people be causal-historical theorists and some\npeople be descriptivists. In short, if MMNS's argument against\n'referential pluralism' is sound, there is an equally sound argument\nagainst descriptivism. And note that this argument doesn't rely on any\nthought experiments about particular cases. It doesn't even rely on\nthought experiments about names like 'Einstein', where there isn't any\nevidence that Kripke is wrong about how those names work.\n\nDialectically, the situation is this. MMNS have offered an argument from\nthe possibility of communicating under conditions of ignorance about\none's interlocutor's knowledge. Similar arguments have been offered\nagainst descriptivism. If such arguments are successful, then\ndescriptivism is false, and there's no problem with philosophers making\narguments from the falsity of descriptivism. If such arguments are\nunsuccessful, then MMNS haven't shown that it is wrong for philosophers\nto assume that the causal-historical theory is the right theory for\n*their* dialect, even if some other people are descriptivists. And, as\nMMNS concede, as long as the philosophers themselves speak a\ncausal-historical theory dialect, the uses of the causal-historical\ntheory in philosophy seem appropriate. The only way this argument could\nfail is if MMNS's argument from the possibility of communicating under\nconditions of ignorance about one's interlocutor's knowledge is stronger\nthan the analogous arguments against descriptivism. But we see no reason\nto believe that is so. If anything, it seems like a weaker argument,\nbecause of the considerations arising from our fable about Kevin and the\n'Gödel lived here' sign.\n\nSo we don't think MMNS have a good reply to the philosopher who insists\nthat they only need the causal-historical theory to be true of *their*\ndialect. But in fact we think that philosophers rarely even assume that\nmuch.\n\nLet's consider one of the examples that they cite: Richard Boyd's use of\nthe causal-historical theory of reference in developing and defending\nhis version of \"Cornell Realism\" in his [-@Boyd1988]. Here's one way one\ncould try and argue for moral realism from the causal-historical theory.\n\n1.  The causal-historical theory of reference is the correct theory of\n    reference for all words in all dialects (or at least our dialect).\n\n2.  So, it is the correct theory for 'good'.\n\nBut that's not Boyd's actual argument. And that's a good thing, because\nthe first premise is implausible. Someone defending it has to explain\ndescriptive names like 'Neptune', logical terms like 'and', empty\npredicates like 'witch', and so on. And Boyd's not in that business. His\nargument is subtler. Boyd uses the causal-historical theory for two\npurposes. First, he uses the development of a naturalistically\nacceptable theory of reference as part of a long list of developments in\npost-positivist philosophy that collectively constitute a \"distinctively\nrealist conception of the central issues in the philosophy of science\"\n[@Boyd1988 188]. Second, he uses the causal-historical theory of\nreference, as it applies to natural kind terms, as part of a story about\nhow we can know a lot about kinds that are not always easily observable\n[@Boyd1988 195-196]. By analogy, he suggests that we should be\noptimistic that a naturalistically acceptable moral theory exists, and\nthat it is consistent with us having a lot of moral knowledge.\n\nOnce we look at the details of Boyd's argument, we see that it is an\nargument that duelling intuitions about the Gödel/Schmidt example simply\ncan't touch. In part that's because Boyd cares primarily about natural\nkind terms, not names. But more importantly it is because, as we noted\nin section 2, the only point that's at issue by the time Kripke raises\nthe Gödel/Schmidt example is the *number* of descriptive names. Just\nlooking at the arguments Kripke raises before that example gives us more\nthan enough evidence to use in the kind of argument Boyd is making.\n\nIt would take us far beyond the length of a short reply to go through\nevery philosophical use of the causal-historical theory that MMNS\npurport to refute in this much detail. But we think that the kind of\nresponse we've used here will frequently work. That is, we think few, if\nany, of the arguments they attack use the parts of the causal-historical\ntheory that Kripke is defending with the Gödel/Schmidt example, and so\neven if that example fails, it wouldn't undermine those theories.\n\n[^1]: Note that a causal descriptivist about names will also say that\n    the correct answer to this question is (B). So the experiment isn't\n    really testing descriptivism as such versus Kripke's\n    causal-historical theory, but some particular versions of\n    descriptivism against Kripke's theory. These versions of\n    descriptivism say that names refer to the satisfiers of (generally\n    non-linguistic) descriptions that the name's user associates with\n    the name. One such version is 'famous deeds' descriptivism, and the\n    descriptions MMNS use are typically famous deeds; nevertheless, that\n    seems inessential to their experiments. When we use 'descriptivism'\n    in this paper, we'll mean any such version of descriptivism. Thanks\n    here to an anonymous referee.\n\n[^2]: This objection relies on an empirical assumption that may be\n    questionable. It assumes that the subject of the experiment\n    associates the same description with 'Gödel' as John does. A subject\n    who (a) is a descriptivist and (b) associates with the name 'Gödel'\n    the description 'the man who proved the compatibility of time travel\n    and general relativity', can also make sense of the vignette,\n    *contra* Martí. So perhaps the objection could be resisted. But we\n    think this empirical assumption is actually fairly plausible. Unless\n    the experimental subjects were being picked from a very biased\n    sample, the number of subjects who are familiar with Gödel's work on\n    closed time-like curves is presumably vanishingly small! We're\n    grateful here to an anonymous referee.\n\n[^3]: This point suggests Martí's criticism of MMNS as stated\n    overshoots. She wants to dismiss arguments from metalinguistic\n    intuitions altogether. But intuitions about well-formedness *are*\n    metalinguistic intuitions, and they are a key part of the\n    syntactician's toolkit. Martí concedes something like this point,\n    but claims that the cases are not on a par, because syntax concerns\n    a normative issue and reference does not. We're quite suspicious\n    that there's such a striking distinction between the kind of\n    subject-matter studied by syntacticians and semanticists. Devitt's\n    version of this point is more modest and does not obviously commit\n    to this exaggeration.\n\n[^4]: Here's one example where testing intuitions and examining the\n    corpus may lead to different answers. Many people think, perhaps\n    because they've picked up something from a bad style guide, that the\n    sentence 'Whenever someone came into Bill's shop, he greeted them\n    with a smile', contains one or two syntactic errors. (It uses a\n    possessive as the antecedent of a pronoun, and it uses 'them' as a\n    bound singular variable.) Even if most subjects in a survey said\n    such a sentence was not a well-formed sentence of English, corpus\n    data could be used to show that it is. Certainly the existence of a\n    survey showing that users in, say, Scotland and New Jersey give\n    different answers when asked about whether the sentence is\n    grammatical would not show that there's a syntactic difference\n    between the dialects spoken in Scotland and New Jersey. You'd also\n    want to see how the sentences are *used*.\n\n[^5]: The Gödel/Schmidt example is also distinctive in another way, in\n    that the description in question actually applies to the referent of\n    the name, and indeed speakers actually know this. But the flow of\n    the text around the example (especially on page 84) suggests Kripke\n    intends the example to make the same point as is made by other\n    examples, such as the Peano/Dedekind case (in which the possessed\n    description doesn't actually apply to the referent of the name). So\n    this is probably not crucial to the point the example makes. We'll\n    return below to the issue of just what this example shows. The key\n    point is that the more distinctive the example is, the *less* that\n    would follow if Kripke were wrong about the example; he might only\n    be wrong about examples with just those distinctive features.\n\n\n\n",
