There\nis flurry of new and exciting work on how philosophy got from the death\npangs of positivism and ordinary language philosophy to where it is\ntoday. Some may see this as a much needed gap in the literature. Indeed,\nthere are a couple of reasons for scepticism about there being such a\nfield as history of late analytic philosophy, both of which are\nplausible but wrong.\n\n<aside>\n*Philosophical Studies* 171: 517-533. Thanks to Herman Cappelen and Ishani Maitra for many discussions about the material in this paper.\n</aside>\n\nOne reason is that it is too recent. But it can't be too recent for\ngeneral historical study; there are courses in history departments on\nSeptember 11, so it's not like looking at philosophy from thirty to\nforty years ago is rushing in where historians fear to tread. And\nindeed, if logical positivism could be treated historically in the\n1960s, and ordinary language philosophy could be treated historically at\nthe turn of the century, it seems a reasonable time to look back at the\nimportant works of the 1970s that established the contemporary era in\nphilosophy.\n\nAnother reason is that we all know it so well. We are still so engaged\nwith the key works by Kripke, Lewis, Burge, Perry, Thomson and so on\nthat we don't need to also look at them the way we look at Descartes,\nLocke and Hume. But this, it turns out, is not true. Books by Daniel\n@Nolan2005 and Wolfgang @Schwarz2009 changed the way that some\nphilosophers, even those who knew the Lewisian corpus fairly well,\nchanged the way they read Lewis. There has also been a minor flurry of\nwork on how important the Gödel/Schmidt case is to the argument of\n*Naming and Necessity* [@Devitt2010; @Ichikawa2010; @Machery2012].\n\nBut that's nothing compared to the bombshell that is *Philosophy Without\nIntuitions*. (Cappelen 2012; all page citations, unless otherwise noted,\nto this book.) Herman Cappelen shows, extremely convincingly to my eyes\nat least, that intuitions play a much smaller role in late analytic\nphilosophy than many philosophers thought. Indeed, there is a lot of\ntextual evidence both for the claim that intuitions don't do much\nphilosophical work, and for the claim that many people have said that\nthey do. The first of these claims is all to the good, says Cappelen,\nsince there isn't a particularly good epistemological defence of the use\nof intuitions.\n\nThe evidence for Cappelen's claims comes in two parts. The first part,\nwhich I won't discuss much here, is an extended argument that words like\n'intuitively', or 'counterintuitive', as they appear in philosophical\ndiscourse, don't in general function to pick out, or even draw attention\nto, any distinctive kind of mental state we could call an 'intuition'.\nThe second part argues that when we look at the actual introduction of\nthought experiments into late analytic philosophy, we don't see the\nappeal to intuitions that many philosophers seem to think go along with\nthought experiments. Rather, we see a whole host of interesting\nphilosophical moves. Sometimes a thought experiment functions to\nhighlight an explanandum. Sometimes it gives us a *prima facie*\nplausible thesis that we then argue for (or against) at great length.\nSometimes it just raises a puzzle.\n\nOne upshot of this historical work, one that Cappelen I think does a\ngood job highlighting, is that contemporary philosophy is much more\n*interesting* than its practitioners sometimes take it to be. Philosophy\nis a way of investigating hard questions about the world, often at great\nexpense in terms of human capital, but with thankfully little in the way\nof other expenses. It isn't a matter of tidying up conceptual space.\nThinking of philosophy this way should, I think, help us see why so many\ndifferent kinds of projects are philosophically important.\n\n### Centrality and Its Discontents {#sec:Centrality}\n\nThe big goal of Cappelen's book is to refute the view, which he dubs\nCentrality, that intuitions (of a certain kind) are central to analytic\nphilosophy, and in particular that they are a primary source of evidence\nfor analytic philosophers. The intuitions that he has in mind have these\nthree characteristics. (The quotes are from pages 112-3, where these\nfeatures are articulated.)\n\nF1: Phenomenology\n\n:   \"An Intuitive Judgment has a distinctive phenomenology\" .\n\nF2: Rock\n\n:   \"An intuitive judgment has a special epistemic status ...Intuitive\n    judgments justify, but they need no justification\".\n\nF3: Conceptual\n\n:   A judgment is an intuition \"only if it is justified solely by the\n    subjects' conceptual competence\".\n\nThere's some more detail on F2, but we'll get to that in section\n[6](#sec:Fragile){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:Fragile\"}. And\nthere's a fourth characteristic of intuitions that I want to add.\n\nF4: Speed\n\n:   Intuitions are rapid reactions..[^1]\n\nI'm going to spend much of this paper defending a view that intuitions\ncharacterised by F2 and F4 do play a role, though perhaps not a\n*central* role, in philosophy. But I do think that intuitions\ncharacterised by F1 and F3 are just not important to philosophy. Indeed,\nI think it's a very important fact that they are not that important.\n\nThe claim that intuitions have a distinctive phenomenology is mostly\nharmless but, it seems to me, false. I certainly don't find anything in\ncommon when I introspect my judgments that, say, no set is a member of\nitself, or that losing a limb would seriously reduce my happiness, or\nthat the only language I think in is English. It will fall out of the\nview I'm defending that the best intuitions have no phenomenology, but I\ndon't think that's a particularly important fact about them.\n\nBut the claim that intuitions derive solely from conceptual\ncompetencies, plus the claim that these are the central source of\nevidence in philosophy, is both wrong and dangerous. If that conjunction\nwere true, we'd expect most philosophical conclusions to be conceptual\ntruths (whatever those are). I'm not going to take a stand on whether\nthere are conceptual truths, but I think it is pretty obvious that\nconceptual truths won't help much resolve the following debates.\n(Compare the list E1-E6 on pages 200-201, which I'm basically just\nextending.)\n\n-   Do bans on pornography involve trading off speech rights versus\n    welfare considerations, or do they just involve evaluating the free\n    speech interests of different groups?\n\n-   Is it permissible to eat whales?\n\n-   Under what circumstances is it permissible to end a terminally ill\n    patient's life, or to withhold life-saving treatment?\n\n-   Is all context dependency in language traceable to the presence of\n    bindable variables?\n\n-   Does belief have a phenomenology?\n\n-   Which animals (and which non-animals) have beliefs?\n\nIf philosophy uses largely conceptual evidence, these aren't\nphilosophical questions. More generally, if Centrality (in Cappelen's\nsense) is true of philosophy, then feminist philosophy, legal\nphilosophy, political philosophy, bioethics, philosophy of language and\n(most of) philosophy of mind are not part of philosophy. (This list is\nfar from exhaustive; making philosophy Centrality-friendly would involve\nwriting out huge swathes of the discipline.)\n\nModus tollens obviously beckons. But as Cappelen notes (213), one\noccasional reaction to this is to identify certain parts of philosophy\nas the 'Core' of the discipline, and say Centrality is true of those. If\nCentrality is true of the core of philosophy, then feminist philosophy\n*etc*., are not part of the core of the field. Maybe now some people\nwould be disposed to use modus ponens not modus tollens.\n\nThat would be a large mistake. It would have shocked Plato, and Locke,\nand Hume, and practically every other major figure in the history of\nphilosophy to learn that political philosophy wasn't central to the\nfield. I do think (contra some of what Cappelen says) that some\nphilosophy involves a priori and conceptual investigation. Indeed, I\neven do some of it. But it's not true that when I'm doing that I'm doing\nwork that's deeper, or more philosophical, or more central to philosophy\nthan the work that, for example, Rae Langton or Susan Moller Okin or\nTamar Szabó Gendler or Sarah-Jane Leslie do.\n\nThis reason alone suffices for me to hope that Cappelen's book has a\nvery wide readership. Centrality isn't true, but it is I think widely\nbelieved to true of at least some parts of the field. (Cappelen quotes\nmany people endorsing this view.) I suspect that on the basis of this\nmistake, the parts of philosophy about which Centrality is not obviously\nfalse (especially metaphysics and epistemology) have been seen as more\ncentral to the discipline than they really ought to be. That's not a bad\nstate of affairs for metaphysicians and epistemologists, but it's not\ngood for philosophy, and I hope that Cappelen's book helps put a stop to\nit.\n\n### Intuitions in Detective Work {#sec:Detective}\n\nDespite my very broad sympathy with Cappelen's project, I do think\nthere's a role for intuitions of some kind in philosophy. Just what this\nkind is, and what this role is, will take some spelling out to avoid\nCappelen's arguments. So that's what I'll do for the next few pages.\n\nThe intuitions I have in mind are characterised by F2 and F4; they are\ndefault justified, and they are fast. Here's how I think these kinds of\nintuitions could matter philosophically.\n\nWhen humans are growing up, they develop a lot of cognitive skills. Some\nof these skills are grounded in specific bits of propositional\nknowledge. We learn to count in part by learning that 2 comes after 1,\nand 3 comes after 2, and so on. But not all of them are. We learn how to\ntell causation from correlation, at least in simple cases, by developing\nvarious heuristics, none of which come close to a full theory of\ncausation. Indeed, none of these heuristics would even be true, if\nstated as universal generalisations. But this ability to pick out which\nof the many predecessors of an event is its cause is one we develop very\nearly [@Gopnik2009 33-44], and it is vital to navigating the world.\n\nI think we develop a lot of skills like that; skills which either go\nbeyond our propositional knowledge, or at the very least are hard to\narticulate in terms of propositions. That we have these kinds of skills\nshould hardly be news to philosophers; under the label 'heuristics' they\nhave become quite familiar thanks to the work of, among others, Daniel\nKahneman. They occasionally get a bad press, because one central way in\nwhich psychologists detect them is by seeing where they lead to errors\nthat careful thought would correct. (For instance, our heuristics\nsometimes say that a conjunction is more probable than one of the\nconjuncts, and careful thinking would correct this.) But this should not\nblind us to the fact that these incredibly fast heuristics are often\nvery reliable; reliable enough to be an independent check on our\ntheorising.\n\nThe use of the term 'intuition' to pick out these heuristics isn't\nparticularly idiosyncratic; @Kahneman2011 himself moves back and forth\nfreely between the two terms. He approvingly cites Herbert Simon's\nremark that \"intuition is nothing more and nothing less than\nrecognition\", which I think is basically right. We intuit that $a$ is\n$F$ by recognising that it has the tell-tale signs of $F$hood. Of course\nwe're a million miles from conceptual or *a priori* reasoning here; as I\nsaid, I agree entirely with Cappelen that F3 is not a feature of any\nphilosophically significant source of evidence. Here are a couple of\ncases, one real life and one fictional, that draw out far removed\nintuitive thinking can be from a priori or conceptual thinking. The\nfirst is from Kahneman's description of a case reported by Gary\n@Klein1999; the second is from (Norwegian) crime novelist Jo @Nesbo2009.\nFirst Kahneman,\n\n> A team of firefighters entered a house in which the kitchen was on\n> fire. Soon after they started hosing down the kitchen, the commander\n> heard himself shout \"Let's get out of here!\" without realizing why.\n> The floor collapsed almost immediately after the firefighters escaped.\n> Only after the fact did the commander realize that the fire had been\n> unusually quiet and that his ears had been unusually hot \\... He had\n> no idea what was wrong, but he knew something was wrong.\n> [@Kahneman2011 11]\n\nNow Nesbø. In the story, Harry is the hero, Harry Hole, and Beate is a\ntalented forensic detective.\n\n> 'Forget what you have or haven't got,' Harry said. 'What was your\n> first impression? Don't think, speak.'\n>\n> Beate smiled. She knew Harry now. First, intuition, then the facts.\n> Because intuition provides facts too; it's all the information the\n> crime scene gives you, but which the brain cannot articulate straight\n> off. [@Nesbo2009 126]\n\nThere's at least a family resemblence between Harry Hole's instruction\nhere and Lewis's instruction to his readers at the start of \"Elusive\nKnowledge\" [@Lewis1996b].\n\n> If you are a contented fallibilist, I implore you to be honest, be\n> naive, hear it afresh. 'He knows, yet he has not eliminated all\n> possibilities of error.' Even if you've numbed your ears, doesn't this\n> overt, explicit fallibilism still sound wrong? [@Lewis1996b 550]\n\nReviewers of Nesbø's books often describe his hero as 'intuitive'.\nThat's a little misleading; Harry Hole thinks intuition has a key role\nto play in detective work, but the adjective suggests that he relies\nheavily on his own intuition. That's not right; he's just as often\nbadgering his colleagues to give him their impressions of a crime scene,\nor an interview subject. In these scenes he reminds me of no one so much\nas a colleague constantly wanting to know what one thinks about some\nthought experiment or variation on a familiar case. (These are often the\nbest kind of colleague - full of inspiring ideas!)\n\nSo I think a lot of philosophical progress is made by drawing on, and\ndrawing out, these skills. But isn't this just to say something\nuncontroversial and uninteresting, namely that philosophy relies on\nimplicit knowledge? As Cappelen puts it,\n\n> It is not controversial that conversations have propositions in the\n> common ground. Nor is it controversial that all arguments start with\n> premises that are not argued for. (155)\n\nWell, there's something a bit interesting here, namely that the 'common\nground' and the 'not argued for' premises have much greater overlap in\nphilosophy than in other fields. A book starting with observations about\nthe Galápagos Islands starts with premises that are not argued for, but\nare asserted on the basis of observations. These premises surely weren't\nin the common ground before the 'conversation' starts. I'll say more\nabout this in the next section.\n\nBecause first I want to fuss a little about just what 'common ground'\nis. We'll start with an observation Cappelen makes about the\nGinet/Goldman case of Henry and the fake barns [@Goldman1976]. Many\nphilosophers take it to be an interesting fact that in one scenario,\nHenry knows there's a barn, while in another he does not. Cappelen says\nthat these facts are \"presented as being pre-theoretically in the common\nground\" (172). That seems false at first blush. Before reading Goldman's\npaper, it's not clear philosophers are in a position to form singular\nthoughts about Henry. That's an uncharitable reading though. A more\nplausible claim is to say that we are pre-theoretically disposed to\naccept some long sentence that roughly says that an agent in\nsuch-and-such scenario knows there is a barn, while an agent in a\nslightly different scenario does not.\n\nWe might gloss that last claim as saying that we implicitly knew\nsomething about these scenarios. I'm not sure that's right though. We do\nsurely have lots of implicit knowledge. I know, and so do you, that the\nSydney Opera House is south of the Royal Albert Hall, even if you'd\nnever articulated that thought to yourself or another. But do our\ndispositions to respond to quite finely drawn, and often reasonably\nlong, vignettes count as implicit beliefs, or should they count as\nthings we were in a position to know, but only learned once a\nphilosopher had done the work of drawing the vignette? I can see merit\nin both positions, and don't see firm grounds for preferring one.\n\nLet's introduce some terminology to avoid taking a stance on this\nquestion. Say that a subject has *Socratic knowledge* that $p$ when the\nfollowing two conditions are met:\n\n1.  Once the agent is asked to consider $p$ in the right way, they will\n    come to know $p$.\n\n2.  The evidential basis for this knowledge that $p$ is not the asking\n    itself.\n\nThe first clause says that anyone who reacts to a Gettier case with \"Oh,\nof course that's justified true belief without knowledge\" has Socratic\nknowledge that such a case is a counterexample to the JTB theory of\nknowledge. And they have this Socratic knowledge before the case is even\nraised. The second clause says that if the person reacts instead with\n\"Oh, some philosophers use thought experiments that don't make sense\nunless you know which cars come from which countries\", that *won't*\ncount as Socratic knowledge. They would be expressing some knowledge, to\nbe sure, but the telling of the example would play an evidential role.\n\nIf you are very liberal about which dispositions count as implicit\nbeliefs, and implicit knowledge, then Socratic knowledge will just be a\nspecial kind of implicit knowledge. But if you think considering\nexamples can lead to learning new facts, not just drawing out\ndispositions, then you will think 'Socratic' is like 'alleged', a\nnon-factive modifier. As I've defined it, once you hear Gettier cases\nonce, that they are counterexamples to the JTB theory ceases to be\nSocratic knowledge, and becomes regular knowledge. Note also that we can\nmake sense of some implicit states being more or less Socratic than\nothers; some dispositions to assent require very careful work to\ntrigger.\n\nWhy is the class of propositions that we Socratically know so rich and\nfertile? It's because of the central role of heuristics in our cognitive\nlives. Our interactions with the world don't just furnish us with a set\nof truths about the world. They also furnish us with skills that we can\napply to generate more truths. I suspect that something like this\nobservation is at the heart of the endorsement of F3, that intuitions\nreveal conceptual truths. When we intuit that $p$, we don't always\nmerely recall a prior belief that $p$, or infer $p$ from what we\nantecedently explicitly knew. But nor do we observe that $p$. So what is\nit? It must be something internal, but not memory or inference.\nConceptual competence isn't a bad first guess, but Cappelen shows that\nisn't the right answer. I think the right answer has to do with\ncognitive skills, i.e., heuristics.\n\n### Philosophy: A Negative Characterisation {#sec:Negative}\n\nSo intuitions matter because they reveal Socratic knowledge, and\nSocratic knowledge, when made explicit, is a very good guide to the\nworld. That implies that intuitions should not be confined to\nphilosophy. And, indeed, they are not. If an economic theorist claimed\nthe standard of living among English men was higher in 1915 than in\n1935, it would be perfectly reasonable to reply that intuitively that\ncannot be right, because in 1915 a rather large number of English men\nwere living on the Western Front in catastrophically poor conditions.\nWhat is distinctive of philosophy then?\n\nWe need to clarify this question before we can answer it. Philosophy is\nboth a discipline with a history over many millennia, and an\norganisational unit inside modern universities. These two things overlap\nwell, but not perfectly. Once we note that they are distinct, we can\nseparate out the following three questions.\n\n1.  What questions are philosophical questions?\n\n2.  What questions are, within the academy, primarily addressed by\n    researchers in philosophy departments?\n\n3.  What questions should be, at least within the academy, primarily\n    addressed by researchers in philosophy departments?\n\nThe three questions don't overlap. When Milton @Friedman1953 writes\nabout economic methodology, I think he's addressing a philosophical\nquestion, but work like this is, and probably should be, carried out in\neconomics departments. Questions about professional ethics are\nphilosophical questions that I think should be researched in philosophy\ndepartments, but in the United States at least typically receive more\nattention in professional schools. Let's focus on the third question;\nwhat should a philosophy department do?\n\nMy colleagues at Michigan and St Andrews work on an incredibly wide\nrange of questions, from the interpretation of quantum physics through\nhistory of logic through moral psychology and so on. And I think\nphilosophy departments should have this range of interests. But what do\nall these questions have in common?\n\nIt's not anything to do with necessity or a priority. Those categories\nseriously cross cut philosophy, as Cappelen points out. Historical\ninvestigations into disputes about the parentage of various\nmight-have-been-royals, or mathematical investigation into the nature of\nthe primes are not philosophical, but have to do with necessity and a\npriority. Whether there's a language of thought is contingent, a\nposteriori, and almost paradigmatically philosophical.\n\nIt's not really anything to do with *depth*, at least on a natural\nunderstanding of that. Why pandas have thumbs, and humans have\nappendices, turn out to be reasonably deep questions, but they are for\nbiologists, not philosophers. Under what circumstances is democracy\ncompatible with a strong executive is, at least to me, an incredibly\ndeep and important question, but it's a question to be answered,\nprimarily, in history and political science departments.[^2] On the\nother hand, whether we can tell a plausible supervaluationist story\nabout belief reports is not particularly deep, but a perfectly good\nsubject for a philosophical inquiry as in @Weatherson2003-WEAMMP.\n\nBetter, I think, is to say that philosophical questions are those where\nimplicit or Socratic knowledge, including crucially intuitions, can\nplausibly play a large role in getting to an answer. Philosophy is a\nlittle recursive, so it includes investigations into its own\ninvestigations, including historical work and metaphilosophical work.\n(Two fields which, prior to Cappelen's book, had surprisingly little\ninteraction.) That's not to say we're always right that Socratic\nknowledge can answer the questions philosophy sets. Maybe some questions\nin mind and language are best answered with the aid of neurological or\nphonological work that requires powerful measuring devices. But the\nquestions are ones where starting with the knowledge and skills we\nalready have seems like a plausible starting point, or at least not\nentirely crazy. This makes philosophy distinct from, say, history. We\nuse intuitions in history too, especially intuitions about what explains\nwhat. But we need more; intuition won't help if you want to know how\nmany troops Henry had at Agincourt.\n\nThis hypothesis explains, I think, one of the historically important\nfacts about philosophy. Philosophy gives birth to disciplines. Physics,\neconomics, psychology and cognitive science were all, at one time, part\nof philosophy. In some cases, the split was very recent. The economics\ntripos at Cambridge only split from philosophy in 1903 [@Tribe2002]. The\n*Australasian Journal of Philosophy* was the *Australasian Journal of\nPsychology and Philosophy* until 1946. Why does philosophy give rise to\ndisciplines like these?\n\nI think having a negative characterisation of philosophy helps explain\nit. Philosophy has a lot in common, methodologically, with physics,\neconomics, psychology and so on. All those fields use intuitions and\nother forms of Socratic knowledge. But the other fields use other things\ntoo, especially observation. It's when it becomes clear that armchair\nmethods play too small a role in the research that the field leaves\nphilosophy.\n\nOf course, philosophers care more about their questions than their\nmethods, so when the need for non-armchair methods becomes pressing,\nsome of the individual philosophers will go along, picking up more and\nmore observational knowledge and experimental skills. Note how much more\nempirical research informs the recent work by (for example) Gilbert\nHarman, Kim Sterelny and Peter Carruthers, compared to their earlier\nwork\n[@Harman1973; @Harman2011; @DevittSterelny1987; @Sterelny2012; @Carruthers1990; @Carruthers2011].\nFrom the other direction, our armchairs come with more knowledge now\nthan they used to, which is partially why engaging with Laura Ruetsche's\nwork in philosophy of science requires more empirical knowledge engaging\nwith William Whewell's [@Ruetsche2011; @Whewell1840]. But still I think\nthe general picture holds; a question is fit for philosophy iff it is\nplausible that the intuitive, armchair methods which are part of every\nacademic's toolkit can, on their own, generate serious progress on the\nquestion.\n\n### Letting Go {#sec:Go}\n\nI've said that Lewis's instruction at the start of \"Elusive Knowledge\"\nis to look to intuitions, not to theoretical beliefs. But that might\ninvolve reading more into Lewis than is really there. What he literally\nasks the reader is to not appeal to their preferred theory of knowledge.\nIs that the same as an appeal to intuitions?\n\nIt need not always be. Sometimes, asking people to let go of their prior\ntheory involves asking them to engage in a complex cognitive task. In\nMeditation One, Descartes has us go through quite a lot of thoughts\nbefore we can be pre-theoretical in the way he wants us to be.\n\nBut I don't think that's what's going on with Lewis. For one thing, he\ndoesn't guide us back to a pre-theoretic naı̈veté the way Descartes does.\nBut more generally, I think getting snap judgments is a way of letting\ngo of some prior theories.\n\nThe picture I have here, and it is nothing more than a picture, is that\nintuitions are judgments delivered by heuristics, heuristics are\ndeployed by Fodorian modules, and Fodorian modules are informationally\nencapsulated [@Fodor1983; @Fodor2000]. That is, when we rely on a\nheuristic, we don't use all of the information at our disposal. The\nclassic example of this is eyesight; we may know that there are no\nelephants on Market Street in St Andrews, but given the right visual\nstimuli, our eyes will still insist that there is an elephant *right\nthere*. The background theory about the spatial distribution of\nelephants isn't encoded into the visual module. More generally, to rely\non a heuristic just is to make a judgment using a part of our mind that\ndoesn't believe some of the things that we do. And that's good, because\nit is a kind of independent check on the beliefs we have.[^3]\n\nBut isn't the idea that snap judgments are essential to philosophy\ninconsistent with the fact that we work very hard on getting our\nexamples just right, and (as Cappelen shows), argue at great length over\nwhat to say about various examples? I think it isn't, because there are\ntwo respects in which our practice reveals a sensitivity to snap\njudgments, and a respect for their use as a check on theorising.\n\nLet me tell you a small secret. I haven't heard anything that even\nsounds like a counterexample to the broadly Stalnakerian theory of\nindicative conditionals that I like for about a decade. That's not\nbecause there aren't any intuitive counterexamples. It's just because my\nintuitions have been trained to accord with this kind of theory.[^4] So\nwhat do I do? Do I give up on the use of intuitions as a test of theory?\nNo, I ask colleagues for their intuitions. Sometimes I ask them a lot of\ndifferent questions, and sometimes I work rather hard on refining the\nquestion, or (when they sadly disagree with my theory) finding ways to\nundermine their intuitions. Given the number of similar questions I get\nfrom other colleagues, I don't think my methodology here is distinctive.\nIn short, we can work very hard before and after getting the snap\njudgments, while giving those judgments a role.\n\nThis might be more idiosyncratic, but I also do a bunch of things in\npapers to draw out snap judgments. The main idea is to distract the\nreader from the fact that they are about to be prompted for an\nintuition, one that may not accord with their preferred theory. So I'll\nuse deliberately absurd props (like Vinny the talking vulture), or start\nan example without flagging that it is an example. My favourite move\nalong these lines is to set up an example in such a way that the example\ndoesn't make sense unless some theoretical claim I want to argue for is\ntrue. Then, after much discussion of the correct verdict on the case, I\ncan announce that the very sensibility of the prior discussion is proof\nthat, at least intuitively, the theory I'm pushing must be true.\n\nWe're going to come back to this theme a bit later, because I think it's\nrather important. The cases you can remember from papers are probably\nnot the ones where intuition mattered. The big role for intuition in\nphilosophy (and in many other disciplines) is in checking the small\nsteps along the way. That's why I join Cappelen in opposing the\nmethodological rationalists; I don't think intuitions are distinctive to\nphilosophy, and these small steps don't have much of a phenomenology.\nBut that doesn't mean they are unimportant.\n\n### Strength and Fragility {#sec:Fragile}\n\nOne of the big trends in late 20th Century epistemology has been the\nseparation of two senses of *strength of evidence*. This might mean\n\n1.  How strong a doxastic state is supported by the evidence.\n\n2.  How resilient the force of the evidence is in the face of\n    counterevidence.\n\nOne thing that conservative epistemologies (e.g., @Harman1986) and\ndogmatic epistemologies (e.g., @Pryor2000) have in common is that\nsources which might be very strong in the first sense might be very weak\nin the second sense. In particular, there can be sources of evidence\nthat ground knowledge, and hence be rather strong in tthe first sense,\nbut easily overturned by conflicting evidence. I prefer to reserve the\nterms 'strong' and 'weak' for the first sense, and use the terms\n'resilient' or 'fragile' for the presence or absence of the second\nproperty. In that language, the important insight of the conservatives\nand dogmatists is that evidence can be strong but fragile.\n\nThat's roughly how I think of intuitions -- they are strong but rather\nfragile. So they can be unjustified justifiers, which is how I read\nCappelen's feature F2 (i.e., Rock).[^5]\n\nCappelen notes it is hard to tell whether something is being used as a\nstarting point, or an unjustified justifier, so he gives three\ndiagnostics for this. I mostly agree with one, and disagree with the\nother two. I agree that intuitions are non-inferential, and they aren't\nbased on any particular experience, which is his criteria F2.1. (Though\nthey usually are based on experiences taken collectively.) But I would\nalter the following suggestion, which he gives as a second diagnostic.\n\n> F2.2 **Evidence Recalcitrance**: Intuitions are evidence recalcitrant;\n> i.e., holders of them are not disposed to give them up even when their\n> best arguments for those intuitions are shown to fail. (Compare pg\n> 112)\n\nI would rather offer something normative here. What's true of intuitions\nis that they might provide a stronger ground for belief than the best\nevidence we can offer for them. Compare the case of Gettier. As Cappelen\ncarefully notes (194n3), Gettier doesn't appeal to a raw intuition. He\ngives an argument that his subjects don't know. Unfortunately, it isn't\na compelling argument, since it takes as a premise that we can't get\nknowledge from a false belief, and that isn't quite right\n[@Warfield2005]. But Gettier was, to some extent, justified in believing\nthese subjects didn't know to a greater degree than he was justified in\nbelieving this argument was sound. And that, I think, is not uncommon.\n\nThis is why I don't think Cappelen's 'Rough Guide to Rock Detection'\n(121), the third of the diagnostics, is perfectly reliable. He says that\nif evidence is given for $p$ in a context, that's evidence that $p$\nisn't an unjustified justifier in that context. But sometimes we give\narguments for judgments that we think could rest without them. Compare\nthis little dialogue.\n\n> A: Is 'John happiness' a well-formed sentence?\n>\n> B: No; it doesn't have a verb.\n\nHere B gives a judgment, then offers a little argument for it. The\nargument has a strong premise, namely that all sentences have verbs.\nThat's debatable; 'Lo, gavagai!' may be a counterexample. But B's\njudgment isn't undermined by examples that undermine her argument. As in\nthe Gettier case, we may give an argument that doesn't capture the full\nnormative force of the judgment.\n\nTo say that intuitions are unjustified justifiers is not to say they are\nparticularly special. If some conservative or dogmatic epistemology is\ntrue, there will be other unjustified justifiers. And if not, then this\nstory about intuitions will be pretty implausible.\n\nThis picture of intuitions as strong but fragile meshes well, I think,\nwith the picture from section [5](#sec:Go){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"sec:Go\"}. There I said the important intuitions are the ones\nyou barely notice or remember. That's because the intuitions are\nfragile; if you remembered them enough to argue about them (or\nexperimentally test them), the fragility conditions had probably been\ntriggered, and the intuition probably wasn't doing much argumentative\nwork.[^6]\n\nBut why not think that intuitions are so fragile that they have no use\nin any philosophical debate? This question deserves more space than I\ncan give it, but here are three sketches of answers.\n\n1.  Intuitions might be valuable checks on theory, and might be\n    resilient enough to perform a valuable checking role.\n\n2.  Just like heuristics have characteristic errors, it might be that\n    careful reasoning has characteristic errors, and there are cases\n    where our first impressions are more reliable. See @GladwellBlink\n    for a summary of some relevant evidence.\n\n3.  Somewhat surprisingly, there may be cases when it is best to trust\n    the less reliable source. The case for this is a bit detailed, and\n    not original to me, so I'll just include a brief footnote for those\n    interested.[^7]\n\n### Some Lewisian Case Studies {#sec:Lewis}\n\nI've described one kind of mental state that deserves the name\n'intuition', and which could play a role in philosophical activity. But,\nas Cappelen presses, we have to work to convert that 'could' to a\n'does'. Do we really rely in intuitive, or heuristic-driven, judgments\nabout cases in analytic philosophy?\n\nAs Cappelen shows, the answer is \"A lot less than you may have guessed.\"\nWe argue a lot more than we intuit, especially about the famous\ncases.[^8] The bit of analytic philosophy I'm most familiar with is\nDavid Lewis's corpus, and since that doesn't play much of a role in\nCappelen's story, I'll illustrate his point with some examples from it.\n\nGoing from memory, I would have guessed the clearest example of a case\nrefuting a theory was the use of finkish dispositions to refute the\nconditional analysis of dispositions. But go to the opening pages of\n\"Finkish Dispositions\" [@Lewis1997b], and you find not an intuition\nabout a case, but an argument that finks are possible. And even though\nthat argument is followed up with more cases, Lewis rather explicitly\n*argues* for his conclusions about each one. See, for example, the glass\nloving sorcerer on page 147. Lewis doesn't avert to an intuition that\nthe loved glass is fragile, rather he \"wield[s] an assumption that\ndispositions are an intrinsic matter.\" [@Lewis1997b 147]\n\nThe discussion of causation turns out to be a little more fertile. From\n(the longer version of) \"Causation as Influence\", I count the following\nappeals to intuitions about cases.\n\n-   The chancy bomb example which shows simple probabilistic analyses of\n    indeterministic causation won't work [@Lewis2004a 79].\n\n-   The Merlin and Morgana example which shows that trumping is\n    possible, and matters for what is the cause [@Lewis2004a 81].\n\n-   The variant on Billy and Suzy that raises problems for\n    quasi-dependence [@Lewis2004a 83].\n\n-   The crazed President example which shows that causation by double\n    prevention is possible, and that causation is not an intrinsic\n    relation [@Lewis2004a 84].\n\n-   The Frankfurt example which shows we can have causation without\n    dependence [@Lewis2004a 95].\n\nThere's a strong sense, I think, in which none of the judgments in these\ncases are argued for. Indeed, they arise as *problems* for theories that\nare otherwise doing rather well. If there was an argument around, it\nwould be for the negation of the intuited judgment. So I think there's a\nrole for intuition here.\n\nBut we should not imagine that this is normal for philosophers, or even\nfor Lewis. Cases, it is true, play a large role in Lewis's writing. But\nthey are very rarely simple refutations of existing theories. We could\nperhaps distinguish four roles that cases play, or perhaps four types of\nphilosophical cases.\n\n1.  Refutation of theories, as in these causation cases.\n\n2.  Illustrations that help explain what's going on in an argument, as\n    in the examples from \"Finkish Dispositions\". For a more extensive\n    version of this, see Lewis's version of Puzzling Pierre\n    [@Lewis1981d].\n\n3.  Tools for showing that we must distinguish various concepts, such as\n    the discussion of Ned Kelly's proof that there's no honest cop\n    [@Lewis1988f].\n\n4.  Simplified versions of the real world, on which we can test various\n    explanatory hypotheses, such as the footy and rugby people in\n    \"Naming the Colors\" [@Lewis1997c].\n\nAnd that list is probably incomplete. The last is fairly fascinating as\na case study actually.[^9] Some of you may have had the following\nexperience when programming, or indeed doing anything that looks like\nworking with code (such as writing in LaTeX). A bug arises. It helps to\nfind a minimal example in which the bug arises, i.e., a smallest program\nthat produces the same bug. This helps you spot what's going on, and if\nyou still need help, it helps your interlocutors focus on the central\nproblem. It's important that you haven't changed the problem; the\nexample must be of the same kind as what you started with. But the\nexample could be much simpler than the case you're most interested in.\nSome philosophy examples are, I suspect, like that. Their value lies in\nrevealing that some striking feature of reality would persist even if\nthe world were simpler. So, probably, the explanation of the feature\nlies in some respect the real messy world shares with the simple example\nworld. (Compare Cappelen's discussion of Perry's messy shopper in\nsection 8.1.)\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that the easiest place to find examples of\ntype 1 in Lewis's work is in the papers on causation. Lewis thinks there\nis no such thing as causation [@Lewis2004a; @Lewis2004d]. Whatever our\ntheory of 'causes' should be, it shouldn't match that verb with a binary\nproperty. Rather, the aim of philosophical work on causation is to give\na reductive analysis of causal thought and talk. In such a project,\njudgments about how we use 'causes' are more likely to be central.\n\nIt's also not coincidental that when an example is central to a paper,\nsuch as the 'dishonest' cop and Puzzled Pierre, they really don't look\nlike type 1. That's one big and important lesson from Cappelen's work.\nPhilosophers do use examples to refute theories, but they are rarely the\nbig famous examples. If an example is central to a philosophy paper, it\ntypically plays one of the other three roles.\n\n### Summary {#sec:Summary}\n\nLet's take stock. I've argued for the following theses:\n\n1.  Socratic knowledge is important to philosophy.\n\n2.  The distinctive feature of philosophy is that it addresses questions\n    that can, at least *prima facie*, be productively worked on while\n    relying primarily on Socratic knowledge.\n\n3.  Intuitions are manifestations of cognitive skills, and much Socratic\n    knowledge is constituted by the possession of such cognitive skills.\n\n4.  Like other\n    forms of Socratic knowledge, intuitions are mostly *a posteriori*,\n    and have roles outside philosophy as well as inside it.\n\n5.  Intuitions are default justified; that is, they can be unjustified\n    justifiers.\n\n6.  This default is very weak; intuitions can easily be overridden by\n    other considerations.\n\n7.  Relatedly,\n    it is rare for any one intuition to be central to a philosophical\n    work; philosophical intuitions mostly concern the little cases we\n    see along the way to larger projects.\n\nI also hinted at, without developing, an argument for\n\n8.  The right intuition can stop even a plausible theory dead in its\n    tracks; and we have (thanks to Ben Levinstein) a mathematical model\n    for why this can be so even if intuitions are much less reliable\n    than theories.\n\nI opened with a discussion of why it matters to philosophy's\nself-conception that point 4 is correct. Since Cappelen also endorses\n4, I probably don't need to say more about that\nhere. But I think there is more to say about 7.\n\nThe first thing I want to note is that\n7 is of course consistent with Cappelen's\ntextual research on important work in late analytic philosophy. In just\nabout any thought experiment that you can remember, the intuitions about\nit don't carry much philosophical weight in the work in which it is\nintroduced. The intuitions that matter are the little ones, the ones\nthat go by so quickly that no one questions them and are largely\nforgotten by all but the *cognoscenti* in that field. Even these\nintuitions aren't *that* common. There are less of them in Lewis than I\nwould have guessed.\n\nStill, I disagree with Cappelen that philosophy is without these\nintuitions. And so I disagree that there's no role for double checking,\nexperimentally if need be, whether these intuitions are really\nintuitive. If a well run survey showed that most people disagree with\nLewis's judgment about, say, the chancy bombs example, I'd reconsider my\nviews about probabilistic causation. But I'd be really surprised to see\nthis.\n\nThe second thing to note is that while\n7 is true, it's not the case that intuitions\nabout one case are never central to a philosophical project. There is\none big counterexample: the Gettier literature. Like Cappelen (194n3), I\nthink this literature is incredibly unrepresentative of philosophy. And\nI think that's in part because it was methodologically flawed. I tried\nto make this point in an earlier paper [@Weatherson2003-WEAWGA], but I\ndidn't get it quite right. (What I should have said was more like what\nElijah @Chudnoff2011 does say.) When we saw the Gettier example, this\nshould have been an invitation to try and find out what feature of\nknowledge was driving the fact that the belief in the main examples\ndidn't amount to knowledge. Gettier suggested it was inference from a\nfalse premise, but that doesn't quite work [@Warfield2005]. You might\nthink it is insensitivity, but that doesn't quite work. At this point\nthere should have been one of two paths taken - attempts to find some\nother explanation of the data, or a reconsideration of whether our\ninitial judgment about the case was wrong. That's what the picture of\nphilosophy sketched here would have predicted, and (this is the point I\nwas trying but failing to make in the earlier paper) that's what\nreflection on our successes in other areas of philosophy would have\nrecommended. But the first kind of project ended up intertwined with\nattempts to analyse knowledge, and stalled for decades. And the second\nproject wasn't seriously undertaken, with some honorable exceptions such\nas @Sartwell1992 and @Hetherington2001. Now eventually this didn't\nmatter, because we discovered that safety based explanations of the\nGettier case would work, even if there is no safety based analysis of\nknowledge, and even if there is some work to be done in getting the\nsafety condition just right\n[@Williamson1994-WILV; @Williamson2000-WILKAI; @Sainsbury1996; @Lewis1996b; @Weatherson2004-WEALMT].\nSo if we strengthened\n7 into a universal claim it would be false --\nthirty years of epistemological struggle attest to this. But it was\nreally when epistemology fell into line with practice in other fields of\nphilosophy that it made progress on the Gettier case.\n\n[^1]: My own views about the importance of this, as well as much else in\n    this paper, owe a lot to Jennifer @Nagel2007 [@Nagel2013].\n\n[^2]: This is not to say that political philosophers couldn't help with\n    this question. There are lots of questions that should have as their\n    research centre some other department, but to which philosophers can\n    usefully help. Indeed, the examples from economic methodology and\n    evolutionary explanation I just mentioned are two more such\n    questions.\n\n[^3]: Philosophers sometimes understate the importance of independent\n    checks. We can know a scale is working, but if we want to check its\n    reliability we don't use it, we use something else. I suspect that a\n    certain amount of theory-independence is part of the explanation of\n    the value of intuitions.\n\n[^4]: Relatedly, I haven't seen Liverpool get awarded an undeserved free\n    kick for about that long.\n\n[^5]: There's an ambiguity in Cappelen's text that I'm not sure I'm\n    interpreting the right way. Let's that someone intuits that in a\n    particular case, $c$ doesn't cause $e$. Call the content of that\n    intuition, i.e., what is *intuited*, $p_d$. And call the proposition\n    that the person has this intuition, i.e., the event of the\n    intuiting, $p_g$. Plausibly both $p_d$ and $p_g$ could be evidence\n    in the right cases, though most of the time the salient evidence\n    will be $p_d$. I think $p_d$ can be an unjustified justifier in the\n    sense that other beliefs, e.g., that a particular theory of\n    causation is false, can be justified on the basis of $p_d$, but no\n    other beliefs the agent has justify $p_d$. But you might want a\n    stronger sense of 'unjustified', where it means not just not\n    justified by anything else, but not justified *at all*. I think in\n    these kinds of cases, $p_d$ is justified, just not justified by\n    anything else. And the justification is, as I'll get to below,\n    strong but fragile. If when Cappelen says that intuitions, according\n    to Centrality, are unjustified justifiers he means that the belief\n    that $p_d$ is unjustified, then I'm not defending Centrality. I just\n    mean that the agent need not have any other mental states which\n    justify the belief $p_d$, or indeed any access to anything that\n    justifies $p_d$. But for all that it might be that the belief that\n    $p_d$ is justified, and the grounds for the justification include\n    what the agent learned about causation as a child, plus perhaps her\n    competence in distinguishing causes from non-causes.\n\n[^6]: I'm simplifying a little here. My preferred position is that\n    intuit*ed*s provide strong but fragile evidence, while intuit*ing*s\n    provide weak but resilient evidence. The reason this is relevant is\n    related to footnote 7.\n\n[^7]: At one point\n    in Ben Levinstein's doctoral dissertation, he considers whether\n    there's a general rule for deciding which of two conflicting sources\n    we can trust. There turns out to be very little in general one can\n    say. In particular, *trust the more reliable source* turns out not\n    in general to be good advice. If sources have characteristic errors,\n    it might be that given what the two sources have said, it is better\n    on this occasion to trust the less reliable source, because the\n    verdicts the sources deliver provide evidence that we are seeing one\n    of the characteristic errors of the more reliable source. It takes\n    more space than I have here to fill in the details of this argument,\n    and most of the details I'd include would be Levinstein's not mine.\n    But here's the big conclusion. Assume that intuitions are often\n    wrong, but rarely dramatically wrong. The reason for that is that\n    heuristics are bad at getting things exactly right, and good at\n    getting in the ballpark. And that careful reasoning is often right,\n    but sometimes dramatically wrong. This is trickier to motivate, but\n    I think true. Then when intuition dramatically diverges from theory,\n    and we don't have independent reason to think that intuition is\n    mistaken about the kind of case that's in question, we should trust\n    the intuition more than the theory.\n\n[^8]: There is interesting work to be done on the relative role of\n    intuitions and arguments about *principles*, but I'm going to leave\n    that for another day, and focus here on cases. The principles/cases\n    distinction can be a bit slippery, but paradigm cases are easy to\n    identify, and we'll be working with fairly paradigmatic cases here.\n\n[^9]: See @Sugden2000 [@Sugden2009] for much more on this use of thought\n    experiments.\n",
