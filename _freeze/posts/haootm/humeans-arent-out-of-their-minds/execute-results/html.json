John Hawthorne has objected to this feature of the view. Whether one has a mind depends on what causal relations obtain between the parts of one's brain. But whether one has a mind does not depend on what happens far far away. I reply on behalf of the Humean. In the cases Hawthorne is worried about, the Humean can and should deny the problematic long-range dependence. One advantage of Humeanism is that it lets us make sense of the idea that the laws could be different in different parts of the universe. In the cases Hawthorne is worried about, that's exactly what is happening - the laws are different here to how they are over there. And what causal relations obtain here is only dependent on what happens in places the laws are the same.\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\njournal: \n  title: \"Noûs\"\n  publisher: Blackwell\nvolume: 41\nissue: 3\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00659.x\ndoi: 10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00659.x\ndate: October 25 2006\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\ncategories:\n  - metaphysics\n  - mind\n  - Humeanism\n  - notes\nself-contained: false\npreview: mind.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: false\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: TRUE\n---\n\n\n\nHumeanism is \"the thesis that the whole truth about a world like ours\nsupervenes on the spatiotemporal distribution of local qualities.\"\n[@Lewis1994a 473] Since the whole truth about our world contains truths\nabout causation, causation must be located in the mosaic of local\nqualities that the Humean says constitute the whole truth about the\nworld. The most natural ways to do this involve causation being in some\nsense extrinsic. To take the simplest possible Humean analysis, we might\nsay that *c* causes *e* iff throughout the mosaic events of the same\ntype as *c* are usually followed by events of type *e*. For short, the\ncausal relation is the constant conjunction relation. Whether this\nobtains is determined by the mosaic, so this is a Humean theory, but it\nisn't determined just by *c* and *e* themselves, so whether *c* causes\n*e* is extrinsic to the pair. Now this is obviously a bad theory of\ncausation, but the fact that causation is extrinsic is retained even by\ngood Humean theories of causation. John @Hawthorne2004-Humeans objects\nto this feature of Humeanism. I'm going to argue that his arguments\ndon't work, but first we need to clear up three preliminaries about\ncausation and intrinsicness.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Noûs_ 41: 529-535.\n</aside>\n\nFirst, my wording so far has been cagey because I haven't wanted to say\nthat Humeans typically take causation to be an extrinsic *relation*.\nThat's because the greatest Humean of them all, David Lewis, denies that\ncausation is a relation at all, and hence that it is an extrinsic\nrelation [@Lewis2004d]. We can go some way to avoiding this complication\nby talking, as Hawthorne does, about properties of regions, and asking\nthe property of containing a duplicate of *c* that causes a duplicate of\n*e* is intrinsic or extrinsic.[^1] Humeans typically take causation to\nbe extrinsic in this sense.\n\nSecond, nothing in Humeanism *requires* that causation is extrinsic in\nthat sense. If one analysed causation as *that intrinsic relation that\nactually most tightly correlates with the constant conjunction\nrelation*, then one would have guaranteed that causation was an\nintrinsic relation. Moreover, one would have a perfectly Humean theory\nof causation. (A perfectly awful theory, to be sure, but still a Humean\none.) Peter @Menzies1996 [@Menzies1999] develops a more sophisticated\nversion of such a theory, and though Menzies describes his view as\nanti-Humean, one can locate the relation we've defined here in the\nHumean mosaic, so such an approach might be consistent with Humeanism in\nthe intended sense.\n\nThird, there is good reason, independent of Humeanism, to accept that\ncausation is extrinsic. As Ned @Hall2004 argues, it is very hard to\nsquare the intrinsicness of causation with the possibility of causation\nby omission. Given the choice between these two, I'm going to accept\ncausation by omission without much hesitation. There is one powerful\nobjection to the possibility of causation by omission, namely that if\nthere is any causation by omission then there is a lot more than is\nintuitively plausible. But since Sarah @McGrath2005 has a good response\nto that objection, I feel happy accepting there is causation by\nomission. So I accept that causation is extrinsic, for reasons totally\nindependent of Humeanism. Since Hawthorne appeals to no feature of\nHumeanism beyond the Humean's acceptance of the extrinsicness of\ncausation, we can take his argument to be an argument against the causal\nextrinsicalist, i.e. the theorist who accepts causation is extrinsic in\nthe above sense. To see that the argument doesn't go through, we need to\nconsider what exactly the causal extrinsicalist is committed to. I'll\nexplore this by looking at some other examples of properties of regions.\n\nSome regions contain uncles and some do not. This seems to be an\nextrinsic property of regions. My house does not contain any uncles\nright now, but there are duplicates of it, in worlds where my brothers\nhave children, where it does contain an uncle, namely my counterpart.\nConsider the smallest region containing the earth from the stratosphere\nin from the earth's formation to its destruction. Call this region *e*.\nAny duplicate of *e* also contains uncles, including several uncles of\nmine. You can't duplicate the earth without producing a duplicate of me\nwho is, in the duplicate world, the nephew of the duplicates of my\nuncles. So it is intrinsic to *e* that it contain an uncle, even though\nthis is an extrinsic property of regions. (There is much more discussion\nof extrinsic properties that are possessed intrinsically in\n@Humberstone1996.)\n\nThis possibility, that a region might intrinsically possess an extrinsic\nproperty, poses a problem for Hawthorne's argument. Here is his\npresentation of it.\n\n> 1.  An intrinsic duplicate of any region wholly containing me will\n>     contain a being with my conscious life.\n>\n> 2.  There are causal requirements on my conscious life.\n>\n> Therefore, Humeanism is false. [@Hawthorne2004-Humeans 351-352]\n\nThe problem is that this argument isn't valid. What follows from (1) and\n(2) is that any region containing Hawthorne must possess some causal\nproperties intrinsically. (As Hawthorne argues on page 356.) And what\nHumeanism entails is that causal properties are extrinsic properties of\nregions. But there is no incompatibility here, for it is possible that\nextrinsic properties are possessed intrinsically, as we saw in the\ndiscussion of uncles.\n\nHawthorne's argument would go through if Humeans, and causal\nextrinsicalists more generally, were committed to the stronger claim\nthat regions never possess causal properties intrinsically. But it\ndoesn't seem that Humeans *should* be committed to this claim. Consider\nagain *e* and all its duplicates. Any such duplicate will contain a\nduplication of the event of Booth's shooting Lincoln, and Lincoln\ndying.[^2] Will it also be the case that duplicate-Booth's shooting in\nthis world *causes* duplicate-Lincoln's dying? If so, and this seems\ntrue, then it is intrinsic to *e* that it contains an event of a\nshooting causing a dying, even though the property of containing a\nshooting causing a dying is extrinsic.\n\nIt would be a bad mistake to offer the following epistemological\nargument that in all duplicates of *e*, duplicate-Booth's shooting\ncauses duplicate-Lincoln's dying.\n\n1.  If there was a duplicate of *e* where duplicate-Booth's shooting\n    does not cause duplicate-Lincoln's dying, then we would not know\n    whether Booth's shooting causes Lincoln's dying without\n    investigating what happens outside *e*.\n\n2.  We can know that Booth's shooting caused Lincoln's dying without\n    investigating outside *e*.\n\n3.  So, there is no duplicate of *e* where duplicate-Booth's shooting\n    does not cause duplicate-Lincoln's dying.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that even there are worlds containing\nsuch duplicates, we might know a priori that we do not live in such a\nworld, just as we know a priori that we do not live in a world where\ncertain kinds of sceptical scenarios unfold\n[@Hawthorne2002; @WeathersonSRE].\n\nA better argument against the existence of such a world is that if it is\npossible, it should be conceivable. But it is basically impossible to\nconceive such a world. Even if throughout the universe shootings like\nBooth's are usually followed by something other than dying, say that\nshooting in most parts of the universe causes diseases to be cured, the\nlarge-scale regularity within *e* (or its duplicate) of shootings being\nfollowed by dying suffices to ground the claim that shootings cause\ndyings in a good Humean theory. The crucial assumption here is that\n*local* regularities count for more than *global* regularities. If the\nlocal regularities deviate too far from the global regularities, then\nHumeans can and should say that different nomic claims (and hence causal\nclaims) are true in this part of the world to the rest of the universe.\nIf they say this, they can say that regions can have causal features\n(such as containing a shooting causing a dying) intrinsically even\nthough causal features are extrinsic properties.\n\nTo illustrate the kind of Humean theory that would have such a\nconsequence, consider the following variant on the constant conjunction\ntheory of causation. The theory I'm imagining says that *c* causes *e*\niff whenever an event of the same type as *c* occurs within a 50 mile\nradius of where *c* occurred, it was followed by an event of type *e*.\nCall this the 50 mile constant conjunction theory of causation.[^3] On\nthe 50 mile constant conjunction theory of causation, it won't be\nintrinsic to Ford's Theatre that it contained a causal event involving\nBooth shooting Lincoln, but it will be intrinsic to any sphere of radius\n50 miles or more centred on the theatre that it contains such a causal\nevent. So on this theory causal properties can be intrinsic to a region,\nthough they are still extrinsic properties of such a region.\n\nThat's a very implausible Humean theory, but when we look at the details\nof David Lewis's Humean picture, we can see the outlines of a more\nplausible theory with the same consequences. Lewis of course doesn't\noffer a simple regularity theory of causation. Rather, he first argues\nthat laws are the extremely simple, extremely informative true\npropositions [@Lewis1973a 73]. That is, he offers a sophisticated\nregularity theory of laws. Then he analyses counterfactual dependence in\nterms of lawhood [@Lewis1973a; @Lewis1979c]. Finally he analyses\ncausation in terms of counterfactual dependence [@Lewis2004a]. The\nphilosophical theory meets the Humean mosaic most closely on the issue\nof what a law is. If we can offer a theory of laws that allows extra\nsensitivity to local facts, while remaining Humean, we can plug this\nback into Lewis's theories concerning counterfactual dependence and\nhence causation without upsetting its Humean credentials.\n\nNow there is a good reason to think that a Humean theory of laws should\nbe locally sensitive. (I'm indebted here to long ago conversations with\nJames Chase.) Humeans typically believe in fairly unrestricted\nprinciples of recombination. And they believe that laws are not\nnecessarily true. So there could be worlds with very different laws. So\nthere is a world which 'patches' together part of the world with laws\n*L*~1~ with a world with laws *L*~2~. If the parts are large and\nisolated enough, it would be foolish to say that within those parts\nnothing is law-governed, or that within those regions there is no\ncounterfactual dependence, or no causation. Much better to say that\nregularities obtaining within such a region are sufficiently simple and\ninformative to count as laws. In our patchwork world, the laws might\nsimply say *In r*~1~, *L*~1~ *and in r*~2~, *L*~2~. Provided the terms\ndenoting the regions are not too gruesome, these will plausibly be\nHumean, even Lewisian, laws.\n\nLet's bring all this back to Hawthorne's example. Hawthorne argues that\ncertain causal facts are intrinsic to the region containing his body.\nThe challenge for the Humean is to say how this could be so when\nHawthorne could be embedded in a world where very different regularities\nobtain. The simple answer is to say that in such worlds, laws like *In\nr, L*, where *r* picks out the region Hawthorne's body occupies, and *L*\npicks out a real-world law, will be true, simple and informative. It is\ninformative because any duplicate of Hawthorne's body is a very\ncomplicated entity, containing billions of billions of particles\ninteracting in systematic ways, ways that are nicely summarised by\nreal-world laws. Simplicity is a little harder to make out, but note\nthat there is a reasonably sharp boundary between Hawthorne's body and\nthe rest of the world (Lewis 1993), so there should be a natural enough\nway to pick it out. In other words, even if we embed a Hawthorne\nduplicate in a world with very different regularities, Humeans will\nstill have good reason to say that the laws, and hence the facts about\ncounterfactual dependence and causation, inside that duplicate are not\nchanged. So not only is it logically possible that Hawthorne's premises\nare true and his conclusion false, we can motivate a Humean position\nthat endorses the truth of Hawthorne's premises and the falsity of the\nconclusion.\n\nSince Hawthorne's argument is invalid then, we can accept the premises\nwithout giving up Humeanism. But I think it is worthwhile to note that\nhis (1) also can be questioned. Hawthorne notes that it is rejected by\nthose such as Dretske and Lewis who say that phenomenal character is\ndetermined in part by kind membership. (See @Lycan2001 for a longer\ndefence of this kind of rejection of (1).) Hawthorne thinks that the\nintuitive plausibility of (1) constitutes a serious objection to those\nviews. But by reflecting a little on the phenomenology of what I'll call\n*totality qualia*, we can undermine the intuitive case for (1).\n\nTweedledee is facing a perfectly symmetrical scene. His visual field is\nsymmetric, with two gentle mountains rising to his left and his right\nand a symmetric plain in between them. All he can hear are two birds\nsinging in perfect harmony, one behind his left ear and one behind his\nright ear. The smells of the field seem to envelope him rather than\ncoming from any particular direction. There is a cool breeze blowing\ndirectly on his face. It's a rather pleasant scene, and the overwhelming\nfeeling is one of *symmetry*.\n\nTweedledum is very much like Tweedledee. Indeed, Tweedledum contains a\nduplicate of Tweedledee as a proper part. But Tweedledum also has some\nsensors in his skin, and brain cells in what corresponds to a\nsuspiciously empty part of Tweedledee's brain, that allow him to detect,\nand *feel*, where the magnetic fields are in the vicinity. And sadly,\nthough Tweedledum is facing a duplicate of the scene facing Tweedledee,\nthere is a major disturbance in the magnetic field just to Tweedledum's\nleft. This produces a jarring sensation in Tweedledum's left side. As a\nconsequence, Tweedledum does not share Tweedledee's feeling of symmetry.\n\nWhether a picture is symmetric is a property of its internal features,\nbut it is also a feature that can be destroyed without changing the\ninternal features by just adding more material to one side. It is a\n*totality* property of pictures, a property the picture has because it\nstops just where it does.[^4] Similarly, totality qualia are qualia that\nwe have in part because we don't have any more feelings than we actually\ndo. Feelings of symmetry are totality qualia in this sense, as are many\nof the feelings of calm and peacefulness associated with Tweedledee's\nstate. It is *not* intuitive that totality qualia should be intrinsic to\na region. Indeed, it seems intuitive that a duplicate of me that was\nextended to produce *more* sensory features would lack these feelings.\nHence a duplicate of me would not share my conscious life in *all*\nrespects, so Hawthorne's premise (1) is also false. To be sure, these\ntotality qualia are a somewhat speculative suggestion, but the Humean\ndoes not *need* them since Hawthorne's anti-Humean argument is invalid.\n\n[^1]: This move requires the not wholly uncontroversial assumption that\n    regions are the kinds of things that can have properties. But I'll\n    happily make that assumption here. Note that the formulation here\n    allows that the property denoted might be intrinsic for some *c* and\n    *e* and extrinsic for others. I'll say causation is extrinsic if the\n    property denoted is extrinsic for some choice of *c* and *e*, even\n    if it is intrinsic for others, as it might be if, for example, no\n    region could possess the property because *c* is a part of *e*.\n\n[^2]: There is a potential complication here in that arguably in some\n    such worlds, e.g. worlds where there is another planet on the\n    opposite side of the sun to duplicate-earth where people are\n    immediately 'resurrected' when the 'die' on duplicate-earth. In such\n    a world you might say that duplicate-Lincoln doesn't really die on\n    duplicate-Earth, but merely has the duplicate-earth part of his life\n    ended. We'll understand 'dying' in such a way that this counts as\n    dying.\n\n[^3]: I assume here that events can be properly said to have locations.\n    Spelling out this assumption in detail will require some serious\n    metaphysics, particularly when it comes to omissions. Where exactly\n    does my omission to stop the Iraq War take place? Here at my kitchen\n    table where I am? In Iraq, where the war is? In Washington, if\n    that's where I'd be were I doing something to stop the war? These\n    questions are hard, though not so hard that we should give up on the\n    very natural idea that events have locations.\n\n[^4]: Ted @Sider2001 [@Sider2003] stresses the importance to a theory of\n    intrinsicness of properties that are instantiated in virtue of the\n    object *not* bearing relations to other objects. My example here is\n    closely modeled on examples from his papers.\n",
