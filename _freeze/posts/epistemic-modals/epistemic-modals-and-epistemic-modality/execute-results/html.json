It concludes that two of these arguments seem to be resistant to the anti-relativist replies that have appeared in response to this work on relativism. One of these is an argument from agreement. It is argued that contextualist theories about various puzzling locutions have a hard time explaining why it is so easy for people who would happily utter the same words to describe themselves as agreeing, if those words were really context-sensitive. Another is an argument concerning attitude ascriptions. It seems there are quite different restrictions on what values the (allegedly) context-sensitive expressions can take inside and outside of attitude ascriptions. Since this isn't how context-sensitive terms usually behave, this phenomena tells against contextualism, and in favour of relativism.\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\n  - name: Andy Egan\n    url: https://www.andyegan.net\n    affiliation: Rutgers University\n    affiliation_url: https://philosophy.rutgers.edu/\ndate: September 1 2011\ncategories:\n  - language\n  - relativism\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: emoup.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 4\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n### Epistemic Possibility and Other Types of Possibility\n\nThere is a lot that we don't know. That means that there are a lot of\npossibilities that are, epistemically speaking, open. For instance, we\ndon't know whether it rained in Seattle yesterday. So, for us at least,\nthere is an epistemic possibility where it rained in Seattle yesterday,\nand one where it did not. It's tempting to give a very simple analysis\nof epistemic possibility:\n\n<aside>\nPublished in _Epistemic Modality_, edited by Andy Egan and Brian Weatherson, Oxford.\n</aside>\n\n-   A possibility is an epistemic possibility if we do not know that it\n    does not obtain.\n\nBut this is problematic for a few reasons. One issue, one that we'll\ncome back to, concerns the first two words. The analysis appears to\nquantify over possibilities. But what are they? As we said, that will\nbecome a large issue pretty soon, so let's set it aside for now. A more\nimmediate problem is that it isn't clear what it is to have de re\nattitudes towards possibilities, such that we know a particular\npossibility does or doesn't obtain. Let's try rephrasing our analysis so\nthat it avoids this complication.\n\n-   A possibility is an epistemic possibility if for every $p$ such that\n    $p$ is true in that possibility, we do not know that $p$ is false.\n\nIf we identify *possibilities* with metaphysical possibilities, this\nseems to rule out too much. Let $p$ be any contingent claim whose truth\nvalue we don't know. We do know, since it follows from the meaning of\n*actually*, that *$p$ iff actually $p$* is true. But that biconditional\nisn't true in any world where p's truth value differs from its actual\ntruth value. So the only epistemic possibilities are ones where p's\ntruth value is the same as it actually is. But $p$ was arbitrary in this\nargument, so the only epistemic possibilities are ones where *every*\nproposition has the same truth value as it actually does. This seems to\nleave us with too few epistemic possibilities!\n\nA natural solution is to drop the equation of *possibilities* here with\nmetaphysical possibilities. We've motivated this by using a proposition\nthat is easy to know to be true, though it isn't true in many\nmetaphysical possibilities. There are many problems from the other\ndirection; that is, there are many cases where we want to say that there\nis a certain kind of epistemic possibility, even though there is no\nmatching metaphysical possibility. We'll go through five such examples.\n\nFirst, there are necessary *a posteriori* claims that arise from the\nnature of natural kinds. The standard example here is *Water is atomic*.\nThat couldn't be true; necessarily, anything atomic is not water. But\nuntil relatively recently, it was an epistemic possibility.\n\nSecond, there are claims arising from true, and hence metaphysically\nnecessary, identity and non-identity statements. A simple example here\nis *Hesperus is not Phosphorus*. This could not be true; by necessity,\nthese celestial bodies are identical. But it was an epistemic\npossibility.\n\nThird, there are claims about location. It isn't quite clear what\nproposition one expresses by saying *It's five o'clock*, but, plausibly,\nthe speaker is saying of a particular time that that very time is five\no'clock. It's plausible that if that's true, it's true as a matter of\nnecessity. (Could this very time have occurred earlier or later? It\ndoesn't seem like it could have.) So a false claim about what time it is\nwill be necessarily false. But often there will be a lot of epistemic\npossibilities concerning what time it is.\n\nTemporal location raises further matters beyond the necessary *a\nposteriori*. We want there to be epistemic possibilities in which it is\nfour o'clock, five o'clock and so on. But it isn't altogether clear\nwhether claims like that can be true in metaphysical possibilities. If\nwe identify a metaphysical possibility with a possible world, then it\nisn't clear what would make it the case that it is four o'clock in a\npossible world. (What time is it in this possible world?) This might\nsuggest there are different *kinds* of facts at a metaphysical\npossibility as at an epistemic possibility.\n\nFourth, there are issues about mathematics. Actually, there are two\nkinds of puzzle cases here. One concerns propositions that are logical\nconsequences of our mathematical beliefs, but which we haven't figured\nout yet. Twenty years ago, it certainly seemed to be an epistemic\npossibility that the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$ had positive integer\nsolutions with $n > 2$. Now we know that there are no such solutions.\nMoreover, if mathematics is necessarily true, then there isn't even a\nmetaphysical possibility in which there are such solutions. So we\nshouldn't think that there was some metaphysical possibility that twenty\nyears ago we hadn't ruled out. Rather, we were just unsure what\nmetaphysical possibilities there are.\n\nFinally, there are issues about logic. (Some views on the nature of\nlogic and mathematics will deny that our fourth and fifth categories are\ndifferent.) Getting the metaphysics of taste right is hard. One option\nthat we think at least can't be ruled out is that intuitionist logic is\nthe correct logic of taste talk. That is, when it comes to taste, we\ndon't even know that it's true that everything either is or is not\ntasty. But that doesn't mean we're committed to the existence of a\npossibility where it isn't true that everything is tasty or not tasty;\nif such a state isn't actual, it probably isn't possible. The liar\nparadox is even harder than the metaphysics of taste. Anything should be\non the table, even the dialethist view that the Liar is both true and\nfalse. That is, the Liar might be true and false. In saying that, we\ncertainly don't mean to commit to the existence of some possibility\nwhere the Liar is true and false. We're pretty sure (but not quite\ncertain!) that no such possibility exists.\n\nThe last two cases might be dealt with by being more careful about what\nan epistemic possibility is. There are quite simple cases in which we\nwant to resist the identification of epistemic possibilities with what\nwe don't *know* to be the case. For discussion of several such cases,\nsee @Hacking1967, @Teller1972 and @DeRose1991. If we could very easily\ncome to know that $p$ does not obtain, perhaps because $p$ is clearly\nruled out by things we do know, then intuitively it isn't the case that\n$p$ is epistemically possible. If we know that if $q$ then not $p$, and\nwe know $q$, then $p$ is not possible, even if we haven't put\nconditional and antecedent together to conclude that $p$ is false. So we\nneed to put some constraints on the epistemically possible beyond what\nwe know to be false. Perhaps those constraints will go so far as to rule\nout anything inconsistent with what we know. In that case, it wasn't\npossible all along that Fermat's Last Theorem was false. And, assuming\nthe non-classical approaches to taste and alethic paradoxes are\nincorrect, those approaches aren't even possibly correct. We're not\nendorsing this position, just noting that it is a way to rescue the idea\nthat all epistemic possibilities are metaphysical possibilities.\n\nThe papers in this volume that most directly address these issues are by\nFrank Jackson, David Chalmers and Robert Stalnaker. Jackson argues\nagainst the view that accounting for epistemic possibilities requires us\nto think that there is a kind of possibility, conceptual possibility,\nthat is broader than metaphysical possibility. He briefly reviews the\nreasons some people have had for taking this position, including those\nwe've just discussed, and some of the reasons he rejected it in \"From\nMetaphysics to Ethics\". But he adds some new arguments as well against\nthis position, what he calls the 'two space' view of possibility. One\nargument says that if there is a possibility of any kind where water is\nnot H$_2$O, then being water and being H$_2$O must be different\nproperties by Leibniz's Law. But then we have an implausible necessary\nconnection between distinct properties. Another argument turns on the\ndifficulty of identifying the water in these supposed conceptual\npossibilities that are not metaphysically possible.\n\nDavid Chalmers discusses what kind of thing epistemic possibilities, or\nas he calls them, 'scenarios', might be. He discusses the strengths,\nweaknesses and intricacies of two proposals: what he calls the\n'metaphysical' and 'epistemic' constructions. The metaphysical\nconstruction is fairly familiar: it takes epistemic possibilities to be\ncentered possible worlds. The epistemic construction takes epistemic\npossibilities to be maximally possible sentences of a specially\nconstructed language. The metaphysical construction requires several\nassumptions before it matches up with the intuitive notion of epistemic\npossibility, while the epistemic construction requires a primitive\nnotion of epistemic possibility. But both constructions seem to\nilluminate the elusive notion of an epistemic possibility. Chalmers ends\nwith a discussion of several applications of his constructions in\nsemantics, in formal epistemology and in moral psychology.\n\nAnother place where one finds an important role for a distinctively\nepistemic (or at least doxastic) sort of possibility is in theorizing\nabout indicative conditionals. In Robert Stalnaker's contribution, he\nexamines two types of accounts of indicative conditionals, which differ\nin where they locate the conditionality. One view analyzes assertions of\nindicative conditionals as a special sort of *conditional assertion*,\nand another analyzes them as an ordinary assertion of a special sort of\n*conditional proposition*. Stalnaker argues that the two views are not\nso different as we might initially have thought.\n\n### Three Approaches to Epistemic Modals\n\nEven when we settle the issue of what epistemic possibilities are, we\nare left with many issues about how to talk about them. Speakers will\noften say that something is (epistemically) possible, or that it might\nbe true. (It's plausible that claims that $p$ must be true, or that $p$\nis probable, are closely related to these, but we'll stick to claims\nabout (epistemic) possibility at least for this introduction.) It's\nplausible to think that a proposition isn't possible or impossible\nsimpliciter, it's rather that it is possible or impossible relative to\nsome person, some group, some evidence or some information. Yet\nstatements of epistemic possibility in plain English do not make any\nexplicit reference to such a person, group, evidence set or information\nstate. One of the key issues confronting a semanticist attempting to\ntheorise about epistemic modals is what to do about this lack of a\nreference. We'll look at three quite different approaches for dealing\nwith this lack: contextualist, relativist and expressivist.\n\n#### Contextualism\n\nConsider a particular utterance, call it $u$, made by speaker $s$, of\nthe form *a might be F*, where the might here is intuitively understood\nas being epistemic in character. To a first approximation, the sentence\nis saying $a$'s being $F$ is consistent with, or not ruled out by, a\ncertain body of knowledge. But whose body of knowledge? Not God's,\npresumably, for then *a might be F* would be true iff *a is F* is true,\nand that's implausible. The contextualist answer is that the relevant\nbody of knowledge is supplied by context.\n\nWhen discussing the ways in which context fills in content, some writers\nwill start with the pronoun *I* as an example. And to some extent it's a\nuseful example. The sentence *I am a fool* doesn't have\ntruth-conditional content outside of a context of utterance. But any\nutterance of that sentence does express something truth conditional.\nWhich truth conditional sentence it expresses is dependent on facts\nabout the context of its use. In fact, it is dependent on just one fact,\nnamely who utters it. So when Andy utters *I am a fool* he expresses the\nproposition that Andy is a fool. And when Brian utters *I am a fool* he\nexpresses the proposition that Brian is a fool.\n\nSo far *I* is a useful example of a context-sensitive expression. But in\nmany ways it is an unusual example of context-sensitivity, and focussing\ntoo much on it can lead to an overly simplistic view of how\ncontext-sensitive terms work. In particular, *I* has three properties\nthat are unusual for a context-sensitive expression.\n\n-   Its content in a context is computable from the context by a simple\n    algorithm - namely the content is the speaker.\n\n-   Its content does not depend on any properties of the intended\n    audience of the utterance.\n\n-   It behaves exactly the same way in embedded and unembedded contexts.\n\nSome terms have none of these properties. Consider, for example, *we*.\n\nThere isn't any obvious algorithm for computing the content of a\nparticular use of *we*. The content may depend on the intentions of the\nspeaker. It may depend on which people have been talked about. In\nsentences of the form *We are F*, different values of $F$ might\nconstrain what values can be rationally assigned to *we*. And when that\nis so, the interpretation of *we* will (usually) be constrained to those\ngroups.\n\nPerhaps most notably, it depends a lot on the audience. If $S$ is\ntalking to $H$, and says *We should grab some lunch*, the content is\nthat $S$ and $H$ should grab some lunch. And that's the content because\n$H$ is the intended audience of the utterance. Intended audiences can\nchange quickly. If Andy says *We will finish the paper this afternoon,\nthen we will go for a walk*, talking to Brian when he utters the first\nconjunct, and Fido when he utters the second, the content is that Andy\nand Brian will finish the paper this afternoon, then Andy and Fido will\ngo for a walk.\n\nThat we has neither of the first two properties is uncontroversial. What\nis perhaps a little more controversial is that it does not have the\nthird either. When we is in an unembedded context it (usually) behaves\nlike a free (plural) variable. Under certain embeddings, it can behave\nlike a bound variable. Barbara Partee and Phillipe Schlenker offer the\nfollowing examples.\n\n(5.9)\n\n:   John often comes over for Sunday brunch. Whenever someone else comes\n    over too, we (all) end up playing trios. [@Partee1989]\n\n(5.10)\n\n:   Each of my colleagues is so difficult that at some point or other\n    we've had an argument. [@Schlenker2003]\n\nIn neither case does we contribute a group consisting of the speaker\nplus some salient individuals. Indeed, in neither case does it so much\nas contribute a group, since it is (or at least behaves like) a bound\nvariable. There's nothing in the contextualist story about we that\nprevents this.\n\nIt's worthwhile reviewing these facts about we, because on the most\nplausible contextualist stories about might, it too has these three\nproperties. The contextualist theory we have in mind says that the\ncontent of $u$ is *For all that group X could know using methods M, $a$\nis $F$*. The group $X$ will usually consist of the speaker and some\nsalient others, perhaps including the intended audience. The salient\nmethods might include little more than easy deduction from what is\ncurrently known, or may include some wider kinds of investigation. (See\n@DeRose1991 for arguments that the relevant methods include more than\ndeduction, and that they are contextually variable.)\n\nNow it isn't part of the contextualist theory that there is an easy\nmethod for determining who is in $X$, or what methods are in $M$. So in\nthat respect *might* is like *we*. But, just as the group denoted by we\ntypically includes the intended audience of the utterance, the group $X$\nwill typically include the intended audience of $u$. And the methods $M$\nwill typically include any method that can be easily carried out. This\ncan be used to explain some phenomena about disagreement. So if Andy\nsays, to Brian, *a might be F*, and Brian knows that $a$ is not $F$ (or\ncan easily deduce this from what he knows), Brian can disagree with what\nAndy says. That is, he can disagree with the proposition that it is\nconsistent with what members of the conversation know that $a$ is $F$.\nAnd, the contextualist says, that's just what Andy did say. If Brian\npresents Andy with his grounds for disagreement, Andy might well retract\nwhat he said. Since arguments about disagreeing with utterances like $u$\nhave been prominent in the literature, it is worth noting that the\ncontextualist theory can explain at least some facts about disagreement.\n\nNor is it part of the contextualist theory that might behaves exactly\nthe same way in embedded and unembedded contexts. Indeed, like *we*,\n*might* can behave like a bound variable. On the most natural reading of\n*Every pedestrian fears that they might be being watched*, there is no\nsingle group $X$ such that every pedestrian fears that for all $X$\n(could easily) know, that pedestrian is being watched. Rather, every\npedestrian fears that for all they themselves know, they are being\nwatched. The naturalness of this reading is no embarrassment to the\ncontextualist theory, since it is a common place that terms that usually\nget their values from context can also, in the right setting, behave\nlike bound variables.\n\nIndeed, thinking about these parallels between context-sensitive\nexpressions and epistemic modals seems to provide some support for\ncontextualism. In his contribution to the volume, Jonathan Schaffer\nargues that various features of the way epistemic modals behave in\nlarger sentences support the idea that an evaluator place must be\nrealised in the syntax. For instance, consider the natural\ninterpretation of \"Anytime you are going for a walk, if it might rain,\nyou should bring an umbrella.\" We interpret that as saying that whenever\nyou go for a walk, you should bring an umbrella if your evidence at that\ntime is consistent with rain. Schaffer interprets that as evidence that\nthere is hidden syntactic structure in epistemic modals, and argues that\nthe contextualist offers the best account of how the hidden structure\ngets its semantic values.\n\nSo the contextualist has a lot of explanatory resources, and a lot of\nflexibility in their theory, which are both clear virtues. But there are\nsome limits to the flexibility. There are some things that the\ncontextualist, at least as we're using the term 'contextualist' is\ncommitted to. In particular, the contextualist is committed to the\ncontent of a particular speech act (or at least of a particular\nassertion) is absolute, not assessor-relative. And they're committed to\nthe truth value of those contents being the same relative to any\nassessor. Let's give those two commitments names.\n\n\\(C\\)\n\n:   The semantic content of an assertion is the same relative to any\n    assessors.\n\n\\(T\\)\n\n:   The truth value of the semantic content of an assertion is the same\n    relative to any assessors.\n\nThe first of these rules out the possibility that the semantic content\nof an assertion differs with respect to different groups. The second\nrules out the possibility that semantic contents have assessor relative\ntruth values. Modern relativists have proposed theories that dispense\nwith these dogmas, and we'll investigate those in the next section,\nafter going over some of the motivations for relativism.\n\n#### Relativism\n\nIn many fields, relativism is motivated by instances of \"faultless\ndisagreement\", and epistemic modals are not left out of this trend. Here\nis the kind of case that we used in @Egan2005-EGAEMI to motivate\nrelativism.\n\n> Consider the following kind of case. Holmes and Watson are using a\n> primitive bug to listen in on Moriarty's discussions with his\n> underlings as he struggles to avoid Holmes's plan to trap him.\n> Moriarty says to his assistant\n>\n> \\(24\\)\n>\n> :   Holmes might have gone to Paris to search for me.\n>\n> Holmes and Watson are sitting in Baker Street listening to this.\n> Watson, rather inexplicably, says \"That's right\" on hearing Moriarty\n> uttering (24). Holmes is quite perplexed. Surely Watson knows that he\n> is sitting right here, in Baker Street, which is definitely not in\n> Paris.\n\nHere we have Watson somewhat surprisingly agreeing with Moriarty. In\nsome sense, it seems wrong for him to have done so. He should have\ndisagreed. Well, imagine that he did, by saying \"That's not right\". The\nquick argument for relativism is that the contextualist cannot make\nsense of this. Whatever group's knowledge Moriarty intended to be\ntalking about when he spoke, it presumably didn't include Holmes and\nWatson; it just included him and his intended audience, i.e. the\nunderlings. And it's true that for all they know, Holmes is in Paris. So\nthe content of Moriarty's utterance is true. But it seems that Watson\ncan properly disagree with it (and can't properly agree with it). That,\nwe thought, was a problem.\n\nThere are three kinds of response to this argument on behalf of the\ncontextualist that we think look promising. All of these responses are\ndiscussed in @vonFintel2008. We might look harder at the denotation of\nthe 'that' in Watson's reply, we might think again about what the\nrelevant group is, and we might look at other cases where the\ncontextualist story is more promising, as a way of motivating the first\ntwo responses. Let's look at these in turn.\n\nAbove we said that Watson disagreed with Moriarty by saying \"That's not\nright\". But that's potentially reading too much into the data. What\nseems correct is that Watson can say \"That's not right\". But that's only\nto disagree with Moriarty if the 'that' denotes what Moriarty said. And\nthat might not be true. It's possible that it picks out, say, the\nembedded proposition that Holmes has gone to Paris. And it's fine for\nWatson to disagree with that.\n\nEven if Watson is disagreeing with the semantic content of Moriarty's\nutterance, it might be that he's doing so properly, because what\nMoriarty said is false. That might be the case because it might be that,\nin virtue of hearing the utterance, Watson became part of the relevant\ngroup $X$. Typically speaker intentions, particularly singular speaker\nintentions, are not the final word in determining the content of a\ncontext-sensitive expression. If Brian points over his shoulder,\nthinking a nice glass of shiraz is behind him, and says *That is tasty*,\nwhile in fact what he is pointing at is a vile confection of Vegemite\ninfused chardonnay, he's said something false. The simplest thing to say\nabout a case like this is that Brian intended the denotation of 'That'\nto be the thing he was pointing at, whatever it is. Similarly, Moriarty\nmight have intended the relevant group $X$ to be whoever heard the\nutterance at that time, even if he didn't know Watson was in that group.\n(Or it might be that, whatever Moriarty's intentions, the semantic rules\nand conventions for 'might' in English determine that the relevant group\nincludes everybody who heard the utterance at the time.)\n\nThis second response would seem somewhat ad hoc were it not for a class\nof examples von Fintel and Gillies describe concerning assessors from\nradically different contexts. Typically the anti-contextualist\ncommentary on cases like these suggest that any hearer who knows that\n$a$ is not $F$ can disagree with $u$. But that doesn't seem to be in\ngeneral true.\n\n> Or consider the case of Detective Parker. He has been going over some\n> old transcripts from Al Capone's court case in the 1920s--Capone is\n> being asked about where some money is in relation to a particular\n> safe:\n>\n> \\(20\\)\n>\n> :   1.  Capone: The loot might be in the safe.\n>\n>     2.  Parker: ??Al was wrong/What Al said is false. The safe was\n>         cracked by Geraldo in the 80s and there was nothing inside.\n>         [-@vonFintel2008 86]\n\nThe knowledge of at least some hearers, such as Detective Parker, does\nnot seem to count for assessing the correctness of Capone's speech. A\ncontextualist might suggest that's because contemporaneous hearers are\nin the relevant group, and later reviewers are not.\n\nSo there are definitely some contextualism-friendly lines of response\navailable to the argument for relativism from disagreement. But\ninterestingly, some of these contextualist responses do not work as well\nas a response to a similar argument from agreement. Imagine that Andy,\nafter doing some reading on the publicly available evidence, correctly\nconcludes that it doesn't rule out Prince Albert Victor. He doesn't\nthink this is very likely, but thinks it is possible. Andy hears someone\non TV talking about the Ripper who says \"Prince Albert Victor might have\nbeen Jack the Ripper\", and Andy says \"That's true\". Intuitively Andy is\nright to agree with the TV presenter, but this is a little hard to\nexplain on the contextualist theory.\n\nNote that here we can't say that Andy is agreeing because he is agreeing\nwith the embedded proposition, namely that Prince Albert Victor was the\nRipper. That's because he doesn't agree with that; he thinks it is an\nopen but unlikely possibility.\n\nNor does it particularly matter that Andy, as one of the people watching\nthe TV show, is part of the relevant group $X$. All that would show is\nthat if Andy knew Prince Albert Victor wasn't the Ripper, the\npresenter's assertion is false. But unless Andy is the group $X$, the\nfact that Andy's knowledge, or even what is available to Andy, does not\nrule out the Prince does not mean Andy should agree with the statement.\nFor all Andy knows, someone else watching, perhaps even someone else the\npresenter intends to include in her audience, has evidence exculpating\nthe Prince. If that's right, then he does not know that the proposition\nthe contextualist says the speaker asserted is true. But yet he seems\njustified in agreeing with the presenter. This seems like a real problem\nfor contextualism.\n\nA quite different objection to contextualism comes from metasemantic\nconsiderations. The most casual reflection on the intuitive content of\nutterances like $u$ suggests there is staggeringly little rhyme or\nreason to which group $X$ or method $M$ might be relevant. The argument\nhere isn't that the contextualist's semantic proposal is mistaken in\nsome way. Rather, the argument is that the accompanying metasemantic\ntheory, i.e. the theory of how semantic values get fixed, is intolerably\ncomplicated. Slightly more formally, we can argue as follows.\n\n1.  If contextualism is true, the metasemantic theory of how a\n    particular use of 'might' gets its semantic value is hideously\n    complicated.\n\n2.  Metasemantic theories about how context-sensitive terms get their\n    values on particular occasions are never hideously complicated.\n\n3.  So, contextualism is false.\n\nThe problem with this argument, as Michael @Glanzberg2007 has argued, is\nthat premise 2 seems to be false. There are examples of\nuncontroversially context-sensitive terms, like 'that', for which the\naccompanying metasemantic theory is, by any standard, hideously\ncomplicated. So the prospects of getting to relativism from metasemantic\ncomplexity are not, we think, promising.\n\nBut there is a different metasemantic motivation for relativism that we\nthink is a little more promising. Compare the difference between (1) and\n(2).\n\n1.  Those guys are in trouble, but they don't know that they are.\n\n2.  ??Those guys are in trouble, but they might not be.\n\nSomething has gone wrong in (2). This suggests that (2) can't be used to\nexpress (1). That is, there's no good interpretation of (2) where those\nguys are the group $X$. This is a little surprising, since we've made\nthe guys pretty salient. Cases like this have motivated what we called\nthe Speaker Inclusion Constraint (hereafter SIC) in \"Epistemic Modals in\nContext\". That is, in unembedded uses of 'might' the group X always\nincludes the speaker. Now the explanation of the problem with (2) is\nthat for the speaker to assert the first clause, she must know that the\nguys are in trouble, but if that's the case, and she's in group X, then\nthe second clause is false.\n\nNow a generalisation like this doesn't look like it should be grounded\nin the meaning (in some sense of 'meaning') of 'might'. For comparison,\nit seems to be part of the meaning of 'we' that it is a first-person\nplural pronoun. It isn't just a metasemantic generalisation that the\nspeaker is always one of the group denoted by 'we'. By analogy, it is\npart of the meaning of 'might' that the speaker is always part of the\ngroup $X$.\n\nFurther, when the meaning of a context-sensitive expression constrains\nits value, those constraints still hold when the term is used as a bound\nvariable. For instance, it is part of the meaning of 'she' that it\ndenotes a female individual. If Smith is male, then the semantic content\nof *She is happy* can't be that Smith is happy. Similarly, when 'she' is\nbehaving like a bound variable, the only values it can take are female\nindividuals. So we can't use *Every student fears she will fail the\ntest* to quantify over some students some of whom are male. And there's\nno interpretation of *Every class hopes we will win* where it means that\nevery class hopes that that class will win. Even when under a quantifier\nand an attitude ascribing verb, 'we' must still pick out a group that\nincludes the speaker. The natural generalisation is that constraints on\ncontext supplied by meaning do not get overridden by other parts of the\nsentence.\n\nThe problem for contextualists about 'might' is that it doesn't behave\nas you'd expect given these generalisations. In particular, the SIC\ndoesn't hold when 'might' is in certain embeddings. So there is a\nreading of *Every student fears they might have failed* where it means\nthat every student fears that, for all they know, they failed. The\nknowledge of the speaker isn't relevant here. Indeed, even if the\nspeaker knows that many students did not fail, this sentence can be\nproperly uttered. This suggests the following argument.\n\n1.  If contextualism is true, then the explanation of the SIC is that it\n    is part of the meaning of 'might' that the relevant group X includes\n    the speaker.\n\n2.  If it is part of the meaning of 'might' that the relevant group X\n    includes the speaker, then this must be true for all uses of\n    'might', included embedded uses.\n\n3.  When 'might' is used inside the scope of an attitude ascription, the\n    relevant group need not include the speaker.\n\n4.  So, contextualism is not true.\n\nPremise 1 would be false if the metasemantics was allowed to be\nsystematic enough to explain why the SIC holds even though it is not\npart of the meaning. Premise 2 would be false if we allowed 'might' to\nhave a systematically different meaning inside and outside the scope of\nattitude ascriptions. And premise 3 would be false if any attitude\nascriptions that are made are, contrary to intuition, tacitly about the\nspeaker's knowledge. Since none of these seems particularly plausible,\nthere does seem to be a problem for contextualism here.\n\nIn their contribution to this volume, Kai von Fintel and Thony Gillies\nreject one of the presuppositions of the argument we've just presented.\nClassical contextualism, what they call 'the canon', says that context\npicks out a particular group, and an utterance of 'It might be that $p$'\nis true iff that group's information is consistent with p. That's what\nwe've taken as the stalking horse in this section, and von Fintel and\nGillies are certainly right that it is the canonical version of\ncontextualism. Von Fintel and Gillies agree that the broad outline of\nthis contextualist story is correct. But they deny that context picks\nout a determinate group, or a determinate body of information. Rather,\nuttering an epistemic modal will 'put into play' a number of\npropositions of the form 'For all group $G$ knows, $p$'. This ambiguity,\nor perhaps better indeterminacy, is crucial they argue to the pragmatic\nrole that epistemic modals play. And once we are sensitive to it, they\nclaim, we see that contextualism has more explanatory resources than\nwe'd previously assumed, and so the motivation for relativism fades\naway.\n\nIn summary, there are four motivations for relativism that have been\nfloated in the literature. These are:\n\n-   Intuitions about disagreement;\n\n-   Intuitions about agreement;\n\n-   Arguments from metasemantic complexity; and\n\n-   Arguments from semantic change in attitude ascriptions,\n\nAs noted, the third argument doesn't seem very compelling, and it is a\nfairly open question whether the first works. But the second and fourth\ndo look like good enough arguments to motivate alternatives.\n\n#### Two Kinds of Relativism\n\nWe said above that contextualism is characterised by two theses,\nrepeated here for convenience.\n\n\\(C\\)\n\n:   The semantic content of an assertion is the same relative to any\n    assessors.\n\n\\(T\\)\n\n:   The truth value of the semantic content of an assertion is the same\n    relative to any assessors.\n\nSo there are two ways to not be a relativist, deny (C) and deny (T). One\nmight deny both, but we'll leave that option out of our survey.\n\nWhat we call *content relativism* denies (C). The picture is that\ncontextualists were right to posit a variable $X$ in the structure of an\nepistemic modal claim. But the contextualists were wrong to think that\n$X$ gets its value from the context of utterance. Rather, the value of\n$X$ is fixed in part by the context of assessment. In the simplest\n(plausible) theory, $X$ is the speaker and the assessor. So if Smith\nasserts that Jones might be happy, the content of that assertion,\nrelative to Andy, is that for all Smith and Andy know, Jones is happy,\nwhile relative to Brian its content is that for all Smith and Brian\nknow, Jones is happy.\n\nThe primary motivation for content relativism is that it keeps quite a\nbit of the contextualist picture, while allowing enough flexibility to\nexplain the phenomena that troubled contextualism. So for the content\nrelativist, contents are exactly the same kinds of propositions as the\ncontextualist thinks they are. So we don't need to tell a new kind of\nstory about what it is for a content to be true, to be accepted, etc.\nFurther, because we keep the variable $X$, we can explain the 'bound\nvariable' readings of epistemic modals discussed in the first section.\n\nA worry about content relativism is that the 'metasemantic' argument\nagainst contextualism might equally well tell against it. The worry\nthere was that the constraints on $X$ seemed to depend, in an unhappy\nway, on where in the sentence it appeared. The content relativist has a\nmove available here. She can say that as a rule, whenever there's a\nvariable like $X$ attached to a term, and that term is in an attitude\nascription, then the variable is bound to the subject of the ascription.\nThis might be an interesting generalisation. For instance, if she is a\ncontent relativist about both epistemic modals and predicates of\npersonal taste, she has a single explanation for why both types of terms\nbehave differently inside and outside attitude ascriptions.\n\nThere are two interesting 'near cousins' of content relativism. One is a\nkind of *content pluralism*. We might hold (a) that an assertion's\ncontent is not relative to an assessor, but (b) some assertions have\nmany contents. So if $s$ says *a might be F*, and this is assessed by\nmany hearers, $s$ asserts *For all s and h know, $a$ is $F$*, for each\n$h$ who hears and assesses the speech. Now when a hearer $h_1$ does\nthis, she'll probably focus on one particular content of $s$'s\nassertion, namely that *For all s and h$_1$ know, $a$ is $F$*. But the\ncontent pluralist accepts (while the content relativist denies) that\neven relative to $h_1$, $s$'s assertion also had the content *For all s\nand h$_2$ know, $a$ is $F$*, where $h_2$ is a distinct assessor.\n\nAnother near cousin is the view, defended in this volume by Kent Bach,\nthat the semantic content of an epistemic modal is typically not a\ncomplete proposition. In the case just described, it might be that the\nsemantic content of what $s$ says is *For all \\_\\_\\_\\_ knows, $a$ is\n$F$*, and that's not a proposition. Now a given hearer, $h$, might take\n$s$ to have communicated to them that *For all s and h know, $a$ is\n$F$*, but that's not because that's the semantic content of what $s$\nsays. It's not the absolute content (a la contextualism), the content\nrelative to $h$ (a la content relativism) or one of the contents (a la\ncontent pluralism).\n\nIt's a very big question how we should discriminate between these\ntheories. Some readers may even worry that there is no substantive\ndifferences between the theories, they are in some sense saying the same\nthing in different words. One big task for future research is to clearly\nstate the competing theories in the vicinity of here, and find arguments\nthat discriminate between them.\n\nA quite different kind of relativism denies (T). This view says that the\ncontent itself of an assertion can be true for some assessors, and false\nfor others. Such a view is not unknown in recent philosophy. In the\n1970s and 1980s (and to a lesser extent in subsequent years) there was a\ndebate between temporalists and eternalists about propositions. The\ntemporalists thought that a tensed proposition, i.e. the content of a\ntensed assertion, could be true at one time and false at another. The\neternalists denied this, either taking truth to be invariant across\ntimes, or in some cases denying that it even made sense to talk about\ntruth being relative to something, e.g. a time.\n\nContemporary forms of truth relativism generalise the temporalist\npicture. The temporalists thought that propositions are true or false\nrelative to a world-time pair. Modern relativists think that\npropositions are true or false relative to a world-assessor pair, or\nwhat loosely following @Quine1969 we might call a centered world. (Quine\nused this to pick out any world-place-time triple, but since most times\nand places don't have assessors at them, world-assessor pairs, or even\nworld-assessor-time triples, are more restricted.) For example, as a\nfirst pass at a truth-relativism about predicates of personal taste, one\nmight propose that the proposition expressed by a typical utterance of\n'beer is tasty' will be true at any centered world where the person at\nthe center of the world likes the taste of beer.\n\nThe truth relativist has an easy explanation of the data that motivated\nthe rejection of contextualism. Recall two puzzles for the contextualist\nabout terms like 'tasty': that it is so easy to agree with claims about\nwhat's tasty, and that reports of the form $X$ thinks that beer is tasty\nare always about $X$'s attitude towards beer, not about $X$'s beliefs\nabout how the speaker finds beer.\n\nOn the first puzzle, note that if to agree with an assertion is to agree\nwith its propositional content, and that content is true at the center\nof your world iff you find beer tasty, then to agree with an assertion\nthat beer is tasty, you don't have to launch an inquiry into the\nsincerity of the speaker, you just have to check whether you like beer.\nIf you're in a world full in insincere speakers, and abundant beer,\nthat's relatively easy.\n\nOn the second puzzle, if propositional attitude ascriptions report the\nsubject's attitude towards a proposition, and if a proposition is a set\nof centered worlds, then the subject's attitude towards 'Beer is tasty'\nshould be given by their attitude towards whether that proposition is\ntrue in their centered world. That is, it should be given by their\nattitude towards beer. And that's just what we find.\n\nThe extension of all this to epistemic modals is more or less\nstraightforward. The simplest truth relativist theory says that an\nutterance of the form *a might be F* is true iff, for all the assessor\nat the center of the world knows, $a$ is $F$. As Richard @Dietz2008 has\npointed out, this won't do as it stands. If the speaker knows $a$ is not\n$F$, then their utterance seems like it should be false relative to\neveryone. (Conversely, a speaker who knows $a$ is $F$ speaks truly,\nrelative to any assessor, when they say *a must be F*.) If we're\nconvinced of this, the solution is a mild complication of the theory.\nThe utterance is both somewhat context-sensitive, and somewhat relative.\nSo $S$'s utterance of *a might be F* is true at a centered world iff for\nall $S$ plus the person at the center of the world know, $a$ is $F$. We\nmight want to add more complications (is it knowledge that matters or\navailable information, for example?) but that's one candidate truth\nrelativist theory.\n\nThere are three worries we might have about truth relativism. One is a\nvery big picture worry that the very notion of truth being relative is\nmisguided. This is a theme of Herman Cappelen and John Hawthorne's\n*Relativism and Monadic Truth* . Another is that it overgenerates\n'explanations'. We can't explain cases like the Capone/Parker example.\nAnd a third is that, by making propositions so different from what we\nthought they were, we'll have to redo a lot of philosophy of language\nthat presupposed propositions have the same truth value for everyone. In\nparticular, we'll have to rethink what an assertion is. (That challenge\nis addressed -- in different ways -- in recent work by John MacFarlane\nand by Andy Egan.)\n\nThe strongest defence of relativism in this volume comes from John\nMacFarlane. His work on tense [@MacFarlane2003-MACFCA], and on knowledge\nattributions [@MacFarlane2005-Knowledge], and on the broader\nphilosophical status of relativism and other rivals to classical\ncontextualism [@MacFarlane2005-MACMSO; @MacFarlane2009-MACNC], have been\nimmensely influential in the contemporary debates. Here he develops a\nrelativistic semantics for epistemic modals, along the lines of the\nproposals he has offered elsewhere for tense and knowledge attributions.\nHe argues that many phenomena, several of which we've discussed in this\nintroduction, raise trouble for contextualism and promote relativism.\nThese phenomena include third-party assessments, retraction and\ndisagreement. He argues that only the relativist can explain the\ntroublemaking phenomena.\n\n#### Expressivism\n\nSo far we've looked at two of our three major approaches to epistemic\nmodals. The contextualist says that which proposition is asserted by an\nepistemic modal depends crucially on the context of utterance. The\nrelativist says that the contextualist is ignoring the importance of the\ncontext of assessment. The content relativist says that they are\nignoring the way in which the context of assessment partially determines\nwhat is said. The truth relativist says that they are ignoring the way\nin which propositions uttered have different truth values at different\ncontexts of assessment.\n\nThe expressivist thinks that there is a common assumption behind all of\nthese theories, and it is a mistaken assumption. The assumption is that\nwhen we're in the business of putting forward epistemic modals, we're in\nthe business of asserting things that have truth values. The\nexpressivist rejects that assumption. They say that when we say *a might\nbe F*, we're not asserting that we are uncertain about whether $a$ is\n$F$, we're expressing that uncertainty directly. The contextualists and\nrelativists think that in making these utterances, we're expressing a\nsecond-order belief, i.e. a belief about our own knowledge, or lack\nthereof. The expressivists think we're expressing a much simpler mental\nstate: uncertainty.\n\nOne way to motivate expressivism is to start with the anti-contextualist\narguments, and then argue that relativism is not an acceptable way out.\nSo we might, for instance, start with the argument from agreement. The\nexpressivist notes that there are many ways to agree with a statement.\nIf Smith says 'Let's have Chinese for dinner', and Jones agrees, there\nneed not be any proposition that Smith asserted that Jones is agreeing\nto. We're happy to call all sorts of meetings of minds agreements. So\nthe agreement phenomena that the contextualist can't explain, the\nexpressivist can explain. When Smith says 'Brown might be a spy', and\nJones agrees, there isn't necessarily any proposition they both accept.\nRather, their agreement consists in having a common mental state, namely\nuncertainty about whether Brown is a spy.\n\nThe expressivist may then run out any number of arguments against\nrelativism. For instance, they might argue (against content relativism)\nthat it is a requirement of a speech act being an assertion that it have\na determinate content. And they might argue, perhaps motivated by\ntheoretical considerations about the role of assertions in conversation,\nthat contents which vary in truth value among hearers couldn't be\ncontents of assertions. If true, that would rule out truth relativism.\nWe're moved, perhaps by elimination as much as anything, to\nexpressivism.\n\nThere are more direct arguments for expressivism as well. Isaac Levi\n[-@Levi1996 55] motivated a view on which epistemic modals don't have\ntruth values by thinking about learning. Imagine someone previously\nthought that Brown might be a spy, perhaps on quite good grounds, then\nthey learn that he is not a spy. If that's all they learned, then it\nseems odd to say that there's something that they previously knew, that\nnow they don't know. It seems learning shouldn't destroy knowledge.\nThat's what happens in standard models for belief revision (which were\none of Levi's primary concerns) and it is independently plausible. But\nif epistemic modals express propositions, and those are true or false,\nthen there is a proposition that the person did know and now don't know,\nnamely that Brown might be a spy.\n\nThere are clearly a few possible responses to this argument. For one\nthing, we could make the epistemic modal claims explicitly tensed. Both\nbefore and after the learning experience, the subject knew that Brown\nmight, at $t_1$, have been a spy, but didn't know that Brown might, at\n$t_2$, have been a spy. (Indeed, they learned that that was false.) Or,\nand this is more in keeping with the spirit of this introduction, we\nmight spell out the epistemic modal claim. Before and after the learning\nexperience, the subject knew that it was consistent with everything the\nsubject knew prior to the learning experience that Brown was a spy. So\nthere's no information lost.\n\nThe problem with this move is that it seems to make epistemic modals\noverly complex. Intuitively, it is possible for a child to grasp a\nmodal, and for the most natural interpretation of that modal to be\nepistemic, without the child having the capacity to form second order\nthoughts. (This point is one that Seth Yalcin uses in his argument for a\nkind of expressivism in this volume.) This question seems like it would\nbe good to test empirically, though we don't know of any existing\nevidence that settles the question. Introspectively, it does seem that\none can think that the cat might be in the garden without thinking about\none's own epistemic or doxastic states as such. Those kinds of\nintrospections might tell in favour of an approach which identifies\nepistemic modality with a distinct kind of relation to content, rather\nthan a distinct kind of content.\n\nFollowing important work by Allan @Gibbard1990, there is a natural way\nto formalise an expressivist theory of epistemic modality. Identify a\n'context' with a set of propositions. Sentences, whether epistemic\nmodals or simple sentences, are satisfied or unsatisfied relative to\nworld-context pairs, where a world and a context make a pair iff every\nproposition in the context is true at that world. Then an epistemic\nmodal, say *Brown might be a spy*, is satisfied by such a pair iff Brown\nis a spy is consistent with everything in the context. A simple\nsentence, like *White is a spy* is satisfied by such a pair iff White is\na spy is true at the world. The pairing becomes useful when considering,\nsay, conjunctions. A conjunction is satisfied iff both conjuncts are\nsatisfied. So *White is a spy and Brown might be* is satisfied by a\nworld-context pair iff White is a spy at the world, and Brown's being a\nspy is consistent with the context.\n\nSo far this looks a lot like relativism. A world-context pair is just\nlike a centered world, with the context being what's known by the person\nat the center of the world. If we apply the formalism to real-life\ncases, perhaps taking the contexts to be genuine contexts in the sense\nof @Stalnaker1978, the two formalisms might look very close indeed.\n\nBut there is, or at least we hope there is, a substantive philosophical\ndifference between them. The expressivist has a restricted sense of what\nit is to make an assertion, and of what it is for an expression to be an\nexpression of a truth. The expressivist most insistently does not\nidentify satisfaction with truth. The only sentences that are true or\nfalse are sentences that are satisfied by a world context pair\n$\\langle w,c_1 \\rangle$ iff they are satisfied by every other pair\nstarting with the same world. The expression of such a sentence, and\nperhaps only of such a sentence, constitutes an assertion. Otherwise it\nconstitutes some other speech act.\n\nAnd this is no mere difference in how to use the words 'truth',\n'assertion' and so on. Nor is it even just a difference about truth and\nassertion and so on. It hopefully makes a difference to what predictions\nwe make about the way epistemic modals embed, especially how they embed\nin propositional attitude ascriptions. We used that fact to argue\nagainst expressivism in \"Epistemic Modals in Context\", since we thought\nthere were in some cases more examples of successful embedding of\nepistemic modals, especially in conditionals, than the expressivist\nwould predict. On the other hand Seth Yalcin uses facts about embedding\nto argue, in his paper in this volume, in favour of expressivism. He\nargues that on a non-expressivist view, we should be able to suppose\nthat $p$ is true but might not be true, and that can't be supposed.\n\nThis argument is part of the argument by elimination that Yalcin against\nwhat he calls 'descriptivism' about epistemic modals in this\ncontribution to the volume. He uses 'descriptivism' to pick out a broad\ncategory of theories about epistemic modals that includes both\ncontextualism and relativism. He argues against all descriptivist views,\nand in favour of what he calls 'expressivism'. He says that when someone\nutters an epistemic modal, they do not describe their own knowledge (or\nthe knowledge of someone else), rather they express their own mental\nstate. Some of Yalcin's arguments for expressivism are related to\narguments against contextualism; in particular he thinks like we do that\nthere isn't a viable form of contextualism. But he also thinks that\nthere are problems for relativism, such as the difficulty in supposing\nMoore paradoxical propositions. He also notes that it is a puzzle for\ndescriptivists to make sense of belief ascriptions involving epistemic\nmodals. On a descriptivist model, a sentence like '$X$ believes that it\nmight be that $p$' reports the existence of a second-order belief state.\nBut Yalcin notes there are reasons to doubt that is right. He develops\nin detail an expressivist model that avoids what he takes to be\nshortcomings of descriptivist approaches.\n\nThe two papers we haven't discussed so far, those by Eric Swanson and\nStephen Yablo, are both related to this expressivist family of theories,\nthough their positive proposals head off in distinctive directions.\n\nEric Swanson's contribution locates epistemic modals within a broader\ncategory, which he calls \"the language of subjective uncertainty\". He\nalso emphasizes the diversity of epistemic modal locutions, and draws\nattention to the risks involved in focusing too closely on just a few\nexamples. In the literature so far, 'might' and 'must' have tended to\nget the lion's share of the attention, while other sorts of epistemic\nmodality -- including the more explicitly quantitative sorts ('four to\none against that', 'there's a 55% chance that', etc.) -- have gone\nmostly unnoticed. Swanson argues that attending to other instances of\nthe language of subjective uncertainty serves to undermine many of the\nstandard proposals about epistemic 'might' and 'must', and motivates a\nprobabilistic semantics.\n\nSomewhat relatedly, Stephen Yablo develops a theory about epistemic\nmodals where their primary function is not to state facts about the\nworld, but to update the conversational score. Theories of this kind are\nquite familiar from the dynamic semantics tradition, but Yablo notes\nthat the existing dynamic theories of epistemic modals are quite\nimplausible. One of the challenges a dynamic approach to epistemic\nmodals faces is to say how we should update a context (or a belief\nstate) with It might be that $p$ when the context previously was\nincompatible with $p$. Yablo adopts some suggestions from David Lewis's\n\"A Problem about Permission\" [@Lewis1979a] to try and solve this puzzle.\n",
