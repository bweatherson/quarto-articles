But it might not be\ntrue. The history of physical science certainly gives many of us pause.\nEvery time some class of objects appeared to be the entities that Newton\nhad described as \"solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable Particles\"\nout of which \"God in the Beginning formed Matter\" [@Newton1952 400],\nfurther research revealed that these objects were divisible after all.\nOne might be tempted to see that history as confirming Leibniz'\ndismissal of atomism as a \"youthful prejudice\" .[^1] Perhaps material\nobjects and their parts are always divisible. There are no extended\natoms; nor are there point particles which compose material beings.[^2]\n\nWhen first presented with this hypothesis, our imaginations are quickly\ndrawn to picturing the process whereby a quantity of such matter -- call\nit gunk \\-- is chopped up into smaller and smaller pieces. Prima facie,\nthere is nothing problematic here: insofar as such a process continues\nwithout end, the initial quantity gets resolves into smaller and smaller\nchunks with no limit to the diminution. But suppose this process is\npacked into an hour, as imagined by Jose @Bernadete1964 in his 1964\nmonograph Infinity:\n\n> Take a stick of wood. In 1/2 minute we are to divide the stick into\n> two equal parts. In the next 1/4 minute we are to divide each of the\n> two pieces again into two equal parts. In the next 1/8 minute we are\n> to divide each of the four pieces (for there are now four equal\n> pieces) again into two equal parts, &c. *ad infinitum* [@Bernadete1964\n> 184].\n\nIf matter is divisible without end there seems to be no conceptual\nobstacle to each of the divisions. Yet how are we to imagine the\nsituation at the end of the hour, when the super-task (call it\n'super-cutting') has been performed on a quantity of gunk?[^3]\n\nIf there were extended atoms that were never annihilated, it is clear\nenough what would happen if some super-being undertook to perform\nsuper-cutting: the process would grind to a halt when insurmountably\nhard particles resisted the chopper.\n\nIf, meanwhile, there were point-sized particles that composed planes\nthat were as thin as a line, it would be natural to picture the limit of\nthe process as a sea of separated slivers, each devoid of finite extent\nalong one dimension. As Benardete, notes, one might then redo\nsuper-cutting in order to finally resolve the original stick into a sea\nof \"metaphysical motes\" devoid of finite extent in any direction:\n\n> At the end of the minute how many pieces of wood will we have laid out\n> before us? Clearly an infinite number. If the original stick was\n> twenty inches in length, one inch in width, and one inch in depth,\n> what are the dimensions of the metaphysical chips into which the stick\n> has been decomposed? Each chip will be one inch by one inch by one\n> inch by -- what? So prodigiously thin must each chip be that its value\n> is certifiably less then any rational (or irrational) quantity. Let us\n> now take up one of the metaphysical chips and decompose it further\n> into an infinite number of metaphysical splinters. In 1/2 minute we\n> shall divide the chip into two equal parts. Each pieces will be one\n> inch by 1/2 inch. In the next 1/4 minute we shall divide each of the\n> two pieces again into two equal parts, yielding four pieces each being\n> one inch by 1/4 inch. In the next 1/8 minute we shall divide each of\n> the four pieces again into two equal parts, &c ad infinitum. At the\n> end of the mute we shall have composed the metaphysical chip into\n> metaphysical splinters. Each splinter will be one inch in length. Let\n> us now take up one of the metaphysical splinters and break it down\n> into an infinite number of metaphysical motes [@Bernadete1964 184-5]\n\nThe number of cuts made on the stick, the chip and the splinter\nrespectively is aleph zero. The number of chips, splinters and motes\nleft at the end of each cutting process, meanwhile, is aleph one. (Think\nof numbering each piece in a super-cutting process by an infinite\nexpansion of one's and zero's as follows: if it lay on the left of the\nfirst cut, the first numeral is a zero, if to the right, the first\nnumeral is a one; it if lay on the left of one of the pieces that was\ndivided at the second round of cutting its second numeral is a zero, if\nto the right a one; and so on. For each decimal expansion of one's and\nzero's there is a bit and the end with that expansion.). This result is\nsurprising to some, but poses no deep conceptual confusion. With an\nontology of chips, splinters and motes available to us, there is a\nnatural description available to us of the limit to the super-cutting\nprocesses described.\n\nBut what to say when gunk is subjected to super-cutting? If each\nquantity of matter has proper parts, then a sea of metaphysical motes is\nnot, it would seem, an available outcome. In what follows, we unpack\nthis puzzle, providing along the way some a priori physics for\ngunk-lovers. The problem is only well formed when we make explicit some\nof the assumptions that drive it. We do so below:\n\n> 1.  Gunk\n>\n> Every quantity of matter has proper parts.\n>\n> 2.  Conservation of Matter:\n>\n> No mereological sum of quantities of matter can be destroyed by any\n> sequence of cuts (though it may be scattered)[^4].\n>\n> 3.  Occupation\n>\n> If a quantity of matter occupies a point of space, then there is some\n> volume, extended in all dimensions, to which that point belongs which\n> that quantity of matter occupies.\n>\n> 4.  Super-cutting\n>\n> The laws of the world permit super-cutting.\n\nNote that (1), the thesis that every quantity of matter has parts does\nnot, by itself, entail any of the other theses. One might also think\nthat matter sometimes vanishes as a result of some sequence of cuts,\ndenying (2). One might hold that there are metaphysical splinters (and\nperhaps even chips), denying (3). One might hold that any given quantity\nof matter does have point sized pieces but that those pieces themselves\nhave parts (the parts being of the same size as the whole in this case),\ndenying (3). One might hold that some pieces of gunk can occupy, say, a\nspherical region and also a single isolated point at some considerable\ndistance from the spherical region (while maintaining that no part of it\nmerely occupies the point), also denying (3). One might imagine that\nwhile always having parts, the parts below a certain thickness are\ninseparable, denying (4). One might think there is a minimum amount of\ntime that any event of separation takes, also denying (4) and so on.\n\nIf the gunk hypothesis is maintained, but one or more of (2) to (4) is\njettisoned, there is no problem left to solve. For example: If we are\nallowed to suppose that gunk may vanish, then it will be perfectly\nconsistent to say that nothing is left at the limit of super-cutting. If\nwe are allowed parts that lack finite extent, then it will be consistent\nto adopt Benardete's picture of the outcome. And so on. Our puzzle,\nproperly formulated is: What would happen if super-cutting occurred in a\nworld where (1) to (4) are true?\n\nIn order to answer that question, we need to supplement Bernadete's\nbrief discussion of the super-cutting process. It is not immediately\nclear from what he says that super-cutting a piece of wood will turn an\nobject into chips, even assuming the wood to be composed of point\nparticles. That is a natural description of the limit of the process,\nbut it is hardly one that is forced upon us by the barebones description\nof the process that Benardete provides. When we divide the stick into\ntwo pieces, and then into four pieces, where are we to put these pieces?\nPresumably we must ensure that they are separated. If not, it will not\nbe clear that we really have splinters left at the end. If the stick is\ncut into four, but the four pieces are then stored so closely together\nthat they are not scattered any more, then we will not have four\nscattered objects after two rounds of cutting. By extension, unless we\nseparate the pieces sufficiently after each round (or at least after\nsufficiently many of them) then even in a world where matter is composed\nof point particles, it is not clear that there will be infinitely many\nchips left at the end. Note in this connection that there are limits as\nto how far we can separate the objects. In a world where super-cutting\nproduces chips, we could not, from left to right, put a one inch gap\nbetween each chip and any other, since there are aleph one chips and not\naleph one inches of space along any vector. Nor is it even clear what\nkind of spacing will do the trick: how we are to keep aleph one chips\nseparated from each other? What we need is a formal model showing how\nsuper-cutting is to be performed. Only then can we answer with any\nprecision what would happen were super-cutting to be performed on gunk.\n\nAssume, for simplicity, that we have a stick that is exactly one inch\nlong. At the first stage, cut the stick into two 1/2 inch long pieces,\nmove the left-hand one 1/4 inch leftwards and the right hand one 1/4\ninch rightwards. This can be accomplished in 1/2 second without moving\nthe objects at a speed of faster than 1 inch per second, or accelerating\nor decelerating the objects at a rate higher than 4 inches per second\nper second.[^5] At the second stage, cut each piece into two, and move\neach of the left-hand pieces 1/16 of an inch leftwards, and each of the\nright-hand pieces 1/16 of an inch rightwards. So if the original piece\noccupied the interval [0, 1) on a particular axis, the four pieces will\nnow occupy the intervals: [-5/16, -1/16), [1/16, 5/16), [11/16,\n15/16), [17/16, 21/16). (The reason we are using these half-open\nintervals is to avoid questions about whether the objects that are\nseparated by the cut used to overlap.) This cutting and moving can be\naccomplished in 1/4 of a second, without any piece attaining a velocity\nhigher than 1/2 inch per second, or an acceleration higher than 4 inches\nper second per second.\n\nThe third stage of the cutting is to take each of these four pieces, cut\nthem in two, move the left-hand part of each of the four 1/64 of an inch\nto the left, and the right-hand part 1/64 of an inch to the right. So\nthe eight pieces now occupy the intervals: [-21/64, -13/64), [-11/64,\n-3/64), [3/64, 11/64), [13/64, 21/64), [43/64, 51/64),\n[53/64, 61/64), [67/64, 75/64), [77/64, 85/64). Again, this cutting\nand moving can be accomplished within 1/8 of a second, without any piece\nattaining a velocity higher than 1/4 inch per second, or an acceleration\nhigher than 4 inches per second per second.[^6]\n\nIn general, at stage *n*, we take the 2*^n^* pieces, divide each of them\nin two, move the left-hand piece 1/2^2^*^n^* inches leftward, and the\nright-hand piece 1/2^2^*^n^* inches rightward. This can all be done in\n1/2*^n^* seconds without any piece attaining a velocity higher than\n1/2*^n^*^-1^ inches per second, or an acceleration higher than 4 inches\nper second per second. So the whole super-cut can be performed in 1\nsecond: the first stage in 1/2 second, the second stage in 1/4 second,\nthe third stage in 1/8 second, and so on. Note, moreover, that the whole\nsuper-cut can be performed in a second without the pieces ever moving at\nany huge velocity. If readers doubted the possibility of super-cutting\nbecause they believed it to be a necessary truth that no matters travels\nat or beyond the speed of light, their doubts were misplaced: no piece\nof matter in the super-cutting process approaches a superluminous\nvelocity.\n\nFurther, in this kind of procedure, a quantity of matter that is\nscattered during the super-cutting process remains scattered during the\nprocess. To see this, first consider a particular example. We noted\nabove that at the second stage there were pieces occupying the intervals\n[-5/16, -1/16) and [1/16, 5/16). Before this, the point 0 had been\noccupied; at this stage a gap of 1/8 inch around 0 had been opened. This\ngap keeps being closed at each stage. After the third stage there were\npieces occupying the intervals [/64, -3/64), [3/64, 11/64), so the gap\nis now only 3/32 inch. After the fourth stage, there will be pieces at\n[-27/256, -11/256), [11/256, 27/256), so the gap is now only 11/128\ninch. This process will make the gap ever smaller, but will not lead to\nits closure. As the process continues, the size of the gap will approach\n1/12 of an inch, but never cross that boundary. To see this, note that\nthe size of the gap in inches after stage *n* (*n* ${\\geq}$ 3) is\n1/8 - 1/2^5^ - 1/2^7^ - ... - 1/2^2^*^n^*. The sum of the series\n1/2^5^ + 1/2^7^ + ... is 1/24. Hence the gap at stage *n* is greater\nthan 1/8 - 1/24 = 1/12. So once the pieces around 0 have been separated,\nthey will never be rejoined.\n\nThis result applies generally to all of the separated pieces in the\nsuper-cut. Once a gap is created, parts of pieces from either side of\nthe gap are moved ever closer to the centre of the gap at every\nsubsequent stage of the super-cut. But since we decrease the distance\nmoved by each piece at each stage of the cut, and in particular decrease\nit by a factor greater than 2, the pieces, once disjointed, will never\nbe united.\n\nHow is the matter arranged at the end of the super-cut? To answer this\nquestion we need to assume that motion is continuous. For each part of\nthe object we can calculate its position function, the function from the\nlength of time the super-cut has been in progress to the position of the\npart. At least, we can calculate this for all times until the end of the\nsuper-cut. With the continuity assumption in place we can infer that its\nposition at the end of the cut is the limiting value of its position\nfunction. So we make this assumption.\n\nWe assumed above that there is a Cartesian axis running along the\nobject; say that a part *a* covers a point *x* just in case *a* occupies\nsome region [*y*, *z*), and *y* ${\\leq}$ *x* and *z* \\> *x*. When we\nsay *a* occupies [*y*, *z*), we do not mean to imply it occupies only\nthat region, just that it occupies at least that region. Assume then\nthat a part *a* occupies a point *x* (0 ${\\leq}$ *x* \\< 1), and that the\nbinary representation of *x* is 0.*x*~1~*x*~2~...*x~n~*..., where for\neach *x~i~*, *x~i~* equals 0 or 1, and for all *i*, there exists a *j*\n\\> *i* such that *x~j~* equals zero.[^7] If *x*~1~ = 1, then\n*x* ${\\geq}$ 1/2, so the some part of *a*, a small part that originally\ncovered *x*, will be moved rightward at the first stage. It is possible\nthat *a* itself may be split by the cut, but there will be a small part\naround *x* that is not split, and it will move rightward. If *x*~1~ = 0,\nthen *x* \\< 1/2, so some part of *a*, a small part that originally\ncovered *x*, will be moved leftward at the first stage. Indeed, in\ngeneral some part of *a*, a small part that originally covered *x*, will\nbe moved rightward at the *n*'th stage if *x~n~* = 1, and some part of\n*a*, a small part that originally covered *x*, will be moved leftward at\nthe *n*'th stage if *x~n~* = 0.\n\nUsing the fact that a part gets moved 2^-2^*^n^* inches at stage *n*, we\ncan infer that after *n* stages, a small part that originally covered\n*x* and has not been split by the cuts will cover the following point\nafter *n* cuts.\n$$x + \\frac{(-1)^{x_1 + 1}}{4} + \\frac{(-1)^{x_2 + 1}}{16} + \\dots + \\frac{(-1)^{x_n + 1}}{2^{2n}}$$\n\nAssuming continuity of motion, we can assume that *a* will end up with a\npart that eventually covers the following point, which we will call\n*f*(*x*).\n$$f(x) = x + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{x_i + 1}}{2^{2i}}$$\n\nFrom this, it follows immediately that for all *x* in [0, 1), *f*(*x*)\nwill end up being occupied. It turns out that these are the *only*\npoints that are occupied at the end of the super-cut.\n\nAssume that a point *y* is occupied at the end of the super-cut. We will\nconstruct a number *c* such that *y* = *f*(*c*). Recall that we noted\nabove that whenever two pieces were separated, a gap was created between\nthem that would never be completely filled. While parts of the stick\nwould move closer and closer to the centre of that gap during the\nsuper-cut, the middle two-thirds of the gap would never be reoccupied.\nThat interval, that would never be reoccupied, would be *liberated*. The\ninterval [1/3, 2/3) is liberated at the first stage, the intervals\n[-1/24, 1/24) and [23/24, 25/24) are liberated at the second stage,\nthe intervals [-37/192, -35/192), [35/192, 37/192), [155/192,\n157/192) and [227/192, 229/192) are liberated at the third stage, and\nso on. If *y* is occupied, then *y* must not be in any liberated\ninterval. Therefore it must be either to the left or to the right of any\ninterval that is liberated.\n\nLet *c*~1~ equal 0 if *y* is to the left of the first liberated\ninterval, [1/3, 2/3), and 1 otherwise. Given the value of *c*~1~, it is\nalready determined which side *y* is of one of the intervals liberated\nat the second stage. If *y* is to the left of [1/3, 2/3), for example,\nthen it is to the left of [23/24, 25/24). But the value of *c*~1~ does\nnot determine which side *y* is of the other interval. Let *c*~2~ equal\n0 if *y* is to the left of that interval, and 1 otherwise. The values of\n*c*~1~ and *c*~2~ determine which side *y* is of three of the four\nintervals liberated at the fourth stage, but leave open which side it is\nof one of these four. Let *c*~3~ equal 0 if *y* is to the left of that\ninterval, 1 otherwise. If we repeat this procedure for all stages, we\nwill get values of *c~i~* for all *i*. Let *c* be the number whose\nbinary expansion is 0.*c*~1~*c*~2~...*c~n~*.... It follows that\n*y* = *f*(*c*). The reason once it is determined which side *y* is of\neach of the liberated intervals, *y* has been determined to fall in an\ninterval that is exactly one point wide, and *f*(*c*) is in that\ninterval, so *f*(*c*) must equal *y*. So *y* is occupied iff for some\n*x*, *y* = *f*(*x*). Say *S* = {*y*: ${\\exists}$*x* (*y* = *f*(*x*))};\nthe conclusion is that all and only the points in *S* are occupied.\n\nCould a piece of gunk occupy the points in *S*? Not given the\nassumptions we have made so far. *S* has two properties that might not\nseem consistent at first glance. It is *dense* in the sense that for any\npoint *y* in *S*, and any distance ${\\delta}$, there is another point\n*z* in *S* such that *y* - *z* \\< ${\\delta}$. But it is *disconnected*\nin the sense that for any two points *y* and *z* in *S*, there is an\nextended region *r* between *y* and *z* that is wholly unoccupied. The\nproofs of density and disconnectedness are given in the appendix.\n\nGiven (3), disconnectedness is inconsistent with gunk occupying *S*. If\na material object occupies *S*, it must occupy the points in *S*. Let\n*y* be any one of these points. By (3), *S* must occupy some extended\nregion containing *y*, say, [*y*~1~, *y*~2~). Two cases to consider.\nFirst case: *y*~1~ \\< *y*. If [*y*~1~, *y*~2~) ${\\subset}$ *S*, then\n*y*~1~ and *y* are in *S*, and so are all the points in between them.\nSince the object occupies *S*, it follows that these points are\noccupied. Hence there is no extended region between *y*~1~ and *y* that\nis wholly unoccupied, which is inconsistent with disconnectedness.\nSecond case: *y*~1~ = *y*. Again, [*y*~1~, *y*~2~) ${\\subset}$ *S*, and\nsince this interval is non-empty, *y*~2~ \\> *y*~1~. Hence (*y*~1~\n+ *y*~2~) / 2 is greater than *y*~1~, and all the points between it and\n*y*~1~ are occupied. This is also inconsistent with disconnectedness. So\ngiven (3), no material object could occupy *S*.\n\nIn summary, (1) through (4) plus continuity of motion cannot be true\ntogether. From (1), (2), and (4), we inferred that our super-cutting\nprocess was possible, and that it would not destroy any quantity of\nmatter (though of course it would scatter it). Assuming continuity of\nmotion, we calculated which points would be occupied after the\nsuper-cut. By (3) we concluded that no piece of gunk could occupy those\npoints, or indeed any subset of them, yielding an inconsistent result.\nSuppose that the continuity of motion thesis is dropped. We can then\nmaintain (1) to (4) with consistency. One should note, however, that a\nworld where (1) to (4) holds would be a strange world indeed: if\nsuper-cutting is performed, the pieces of gunk would have to jump\nlocation at the limit. The gunk cannot occupy S: but in order to occupy\na different set of points, various quantities of matter would have to\njump position at the limit.\n\nIf one believes in gunk one has a choice: Abandon one or more of (2) to\n(4) or else deny that it is nomologically necessary that motion be\ncontinuous. Which assumption should be dropped? We leave it to the gunk\nlover to select the most tolerable package. The choice for the gunk\nlover is a little unenviable. Those who are attracted to the view that\nthe actual world is gunky are very much wedded to (1) and (3). When\nphilosophers take seriously the idea that that matter has parts all the\nway down[^8], they do not imagine conjoining that thesis with point\nsized parts, or else immaterial parts[^9], or else quantities of matter\nthat are as thin as a plane, and so on. With a commitment to (1) and (3)\nin place, super-cutting will be loaded with physical significance.\nAccept that the laws of nature permits super-cutting and one will be\ncommitted to either denying the conservation of matter or the continuity\nof motion.\n\n### Appendix  {#appendix .unnumbered}\n\nTo prove density, note that if *y* is occupied, there is a point *x*\nwith binary representation 0.*x*~1~*x*~2~... such that *y* = *f*(*x*).\nFor any positive ${\\delta}$, there is an integer *n* such that\n${\\delta}$ \\> 2^-2^*^n^*. Let *v* be the number represented by\n0.*x*~1~*x*~2~...*x~n~x~n~*~+1~$^\\prime$*x~n~*~+2~*x~n~*~+3~..., where\n*x~n~*~+1~$^\\prime$ = 1 iff *x~n~*~+1~ = 0, and *x~n~*~+1~$^\\prime$ = 0\notherwise. The difference between *f*(*x*) and *f*(*v*) will be exactly\n2^-2^*^n^*^-1^. Since *f*(*v*) is occupied, and *y* = *f*(*x*), there is\nan occupied point exactly 2^-2^*^n^*^-1^ inches from *y*, so there is a\npoint less than ${\\delta}$ inches from *y*, as required.\n\nTo prove disconnectedness, let *y* and *z* be any two distinct occupied\npoints. So for some distinct *v*, *x*, *y* = *f*(*x*) and\n*z* = *f*(*v*). Say that the binary representation of *x* is\n0.*x*~1~*x*~2~..., and the binary representation of *v* is\n0.*v*~1~*v*~2~... Let *j* be the lowest number such that\n*x~j~* ${\\neq}$ *v~j~*. (Since *x* and *v* are distinct, there must be\nat least one value *j*.) Without loss of generality, assume that\n*x~j~* = 0 and *v~j~* = 1. (There is no loss of generality because we\nare just trying to show that between any two occupied points there is a\ngap, so it does not matter which of the two points is the rightward\none.) Let *k* be the number with binary representation\n0.*x*~1~*x*~2~...*x~j~*1, and let *l*~2~ be *f*(*k*). Finally, define\n*l*~1~ by the following equation:\n$$l_i = \\sum_{i=1}^j \\frac{(-1)^{x_i+1}}{2^{2i}} + \\sum_{i = j+1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^{2i}}$$\n\nIt is easy enough to see that *f*(*x*), that is *y*, must be less that\n*l*~1~. For *l*~1~ is the value that *f*(*x*) would take were every\ndigit in the binary expansion of *x* after *j* be 1. But by definition\nthere must be some value *j*$^\\prime$ \\> *j* such that\n*x~j~*~$^\\prime$~ = 0. From this it follows that:\n$$\\sum_{i = j+1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^{2i}} > \\sum_{i = j+1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{x_i+1}}{2^{2i}}$$\n\nAnd from that it follows that *l*~1~ \\> *f*(*x*). Indeed, by similar\nreasoning, it follows that for all *u* \\< *k*, *f*(*u*) \\< *l*~1~. Since\n*f* is monotone increasing, it also follows that for all\n*u* ${\\geq}$ *k*, *f*(*u*) ${\\geq}$ *l*~2~. And from those facts, it\nfollows that there does not exist a *u* such that\n*f*(*u*) ${\\in}$ [*l*~1~, *l*~2~). And since\n*y* \\< *l*~1~ \\< *l*~2~ ${\\leq}$ *z*, this implies that there is an\nextended unoccupied region between *y* and *z*, as required.\n\n[^1]: See 'Nature Itself' in [@Leibniz1998 220].\n\n[^2]: Cf Leibniz: 'I hold that *matter* is essentially an *aggregate*,\n    and consequently that it always has actual parts,' in 'Third\n    Explanation of The New System,' [@Leibniz1998 193].\n\n[^3]: What is important, of course, is that the sequence of separations\n    occur: it does not matter whether some kind of super-sharp knife is\n    responsible for them. In what follows, descriptions of cutting\n    sequences can be replaced without loss of content by descriptions of\n    separation sequences, leaving it open whether repulsive forces or\n    chance events or knives or ... are responsible for the separation\n    sequence.\n\n[^4]: The 'can' here is one of nomological possibility.\n\n[^5]: The idea is that in the first quarter second we accelerate the\n    object at 4 inches per second per second. This will raise its\n    velocity to 1 inch per second, and move the object 1/8 of an inch.\n    In the second quarter second we decelerate it at 4 inches per second\n    per second, so its velocity ends up at zero, and it ends up having\n    moved 1/4 of an inch.\n\n[^6]: Note that, interestingly, if we moved the pieces 1/2 inch after\n    the first round, 1/4 inch after the second round, 1/8 inch after the\n    third round and so on then at the limit, each left and right edge\n    that was once attached will have moved back together again. The\n    process we have chosen preserves separation in a way that the\n    aforementioned process does not.\n\n[^7]: The final condition is important to rule out numbers having two\n    possible representations. For example, we have to choose whether the\n    representation of 1/2 should be 0.1000... or 0.0111..., and we\n    somewhat arbitrarily, choose the former.\n\n[^8]: See, for example, [@Zimmerman1996].\n\n[^9]: Leibniz, with his monads, is an exception of course. No\n    contemporary gunk lover wants a monadology, however.\n",
