This means that if we are to keep the possible‐worlds semantics for subjunctives suggested by Lewis, we need to find a possible‐worlds semantics for indicatives. One reason for thinking that this will be impossible is the behaviour of rigid designators in indicatives. An indicative like ‘If the stuff in the rivers, lakes and oceans really is H~3~O, then water is H~3~O’ is non‐vacuously true, even though its consequent is true in no possible worlds, and hence not in the nearest possible world where the antecedent is true. I solve this difficulty by providing a semantics for conditionals within the framework of two‐dimensional modal logic. In doing so, I show that we can have a reasonably unified semantics for indicative and subjunctive conditionals.\ndate: April 1 2001\nauthor:\n  - name: Brian Weatherson \n    url: http://brian.weatherson.org\n    affiliation: University of Michigan\n    affiliation_url: https://umich.edu\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-0830-141X\ndoi: \"10.1111/j.0031-8094.2001.00224.x\"\ncategories:\n  - logic\n  - language\n  - conditionals\ncitation_url: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0031-8094.2001.00224.x\njournal:\n    title: \"Philosophical Quarterly\"\n    publisher: \"Wiley\"\nvolume: 51\nnumber: 203\ncitation: false\nbibliography: ../../../articles/Rbib.bib\nself-contained: false\npreview: water.jpg\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\nThis paper presents a new theory of the truth conditions for indicative\nconditionals. The theory allows us to give a fairly unified account of\nthe semantics for indicative and subjunctive conditionals, though there\nremains a distinction between the two classes. Put simply, the idea\nbehind the theory is that the distinction between the indicative and the\nsubjunctive parallels the distinction between the necessary and the *a\npriori*. Since that distinction is best understood formally using the\nresources of two-dimensional modal logic, those resources will be\nbrought to bear on the logic of conditionals.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in *Philosophical Quarterly* 51: 200-216.\n\nPicture by [Daniel Palmer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/18535671@N00) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/ecffe4f2-8116-4bcb-9840-0a187ddc6325).\n</aside>\n\n## A Grand Unified Theory?\n\nOur primary focus is the indicative conditional 'If $A$, $B$', written\nas $A \\rightarrow B$. Most theorists fail to distinguish between this\nconditional and 'If $A$, then $B$', and for the most part I will follow\nthis tradition. The most notable philosophical exception is Grice, who\nsuggested that only the latter says that $B$ follows from $A$ in some\nrelevant way (1989: 63). Theorists do distinguish between this\nconditional and the subjunctive 'If it were the case that $A$, it would\nbe the case that $B$', written as $A \\,\\square\\!\\mathord\\to B$. There is some debate\nabout precisely where to draw the line between these two classes, which\nI'll discuss in section three, but for now I'll focus on cases far from\nthe borderline. One important tradition in work on conditionals holds\nthat the semantics of indicatives differs radically from the semantics\nof subjunctives. According to David @Lewis1973a [@Lewis1976b] and Frank\n@Jackson1987 for example, indicatives are truth-functional, but\nsubjunctives are not. This makes a mystery of some of the data. For\nexample, as Jackson himself writes:\n\n> Before the last presidential election commentators said 'If Reagan\n> loses, the opinion polls will be totally discredited', afterwards they\n> said 'If Reagan had lost, the opinion polls would have been totally\n> discredited', and this switch from indicative to subjunctive\n> counterfactual did *not* count as a change of mind [@Jackson1987 66].\n\nThe point can be pushed further. To communicate the commentators'\npre-election opinions using indirect speech we would say something like\n(1).\n\n1.  Commentators have said that if Reagan were to lose the opinion polls\n    would be totally discredited.\n\nYet it is possible on Jackson's view that what the commentators said was\n*true*, since Reagan won, yet the words after 'that' in (1) form a\n*false* sentence. So we can accurately report someone speaking truly by\nusing a false sentence. Jackson's response plays on the connections\nbetween $A \\rightarrow B$ and the disjunction 'Not-$A$ or $B$'. That\ndisjunction has undeniably different truth conditions to\n$A \\,\\square\\!\\mathord\\to$* B*. Pushing the truth conditions of $A \\rightarrow B$\ncloser to those of $A \\,\\square\\!\\mathord\\to$* B* will move them away from 'Not-\n$A$ or $B$'. One gain in similarity and theoretical simplicity is bought\nat the cost of another. Jackson's account, by making $A \\rightarrow B$\nhave similar truth conditions to 'Not - $A$ or $B$' but similar\nassertibility conditions to $A \\,\\square\\!\\mathord\\to B$, tries to have the best of\nboth worlds. How great the similarity between indicative conditionals\nand disjunctions really is, and hence how great the cost of linking\nindicatives and subjunctives, might well be questioned. After all, we\ndon't report an utterance of an indicative using a disjunction.\n\nTwo types of cases seem to threaten the success of a unified theory.\nFirst, rigidifying expressions like 'actually' behave differently in\nindicatives and subjunctives. Secondly, some conditionals differ in\nintuitive truth value when we transpose them from the indicative to the\nsubjunctive. The most famous examples of this phenomenon involve various\npresidential assassinations. The effects of rigidity on conditionals are\nless explored, so we will first look at that. Consider the following\nexample, from page 55 of *Naming and Necessity*.\n\n2.  If heat had been applied to this stick $S$ at $t_0$, then at $t_0$\n    stick $S$ would not have been one meter long.\n\nThe background is that we have stipulated that a metre is the length of\nstick $S$ at time $t_0$. (2) contrasts with (3), which seems false.\n\n3.  If heat was applied to this stick $S$ at $t_0$, then at $t_0$ stick\n    $S$ was not one meter long.\n\nIf we have stipulated that to be a meter long is to be the length of $S$\nat $t_0$, then whatever conditions $S$ was under at $t_0$, it was one\nmeter long. As Jackson points out, we can get the same effect with\nexplicit rigidifiers like 'actually'. We could, somewhat wistfully, say\n(4). It may even be true. But (5) seems barely coherent, and certainly\nnot something we could ever say.\n\n4.  If Hillary Clinton were to become the next U.S. President, things\n    would be different from the way they actually will be.\n\n5.  If Hillary Clinton becomes the next U.S. President, things will be\n    different from the way they actually will be.\n\nIt looks like any theory of conditionals will have to account for a\ndifference between the behaviour of rigid designators in indicatives and\nsubjunctives. We may avoid the conclusion by showing that the difference\nonly appears in certain types of conditionals, and we already have an\nexplanation for those cases. For example, it is well known that usually\none cannot say $A \\rightarrow B$ if it is known that not-$A$. As\n@Dudman1994 points out, (6) is clearly infelicitous on its most obvious\nreading.\n\n6.  \\*Granny won, but if she lost she was furious.\n\nTo complete the diagnosis, note that the most striking examples of the\ndifferent behaviour of rigid designators in different types of\nconditionals comes up in cases where the antecedent is almost certainly\nfalse. The effect is that the subjunctive can be asserted, but not the\nindicative. So this phenomenon may be explainable by some other part of\nthe theory of conditionals.[^1] These are the most striking exemplars of\nthe difference I am highlighting, but not the only examples. Hence, this\npoint cannot explain all the data, though it may explain why pairs like\n(2)/(3) and (4)/(5) are striking. For instance, in the following pairs,\nthe indicative seems appropriate and intuitively true, and the\nsubjunctive seems inappropriate and intuitively false.\n\n7.  If C-fibres firing is what causes pain sensations, then C-fibres\n    firing is what actually causes pain sensations.\n\n8.  If C-fibres firing were what caused pain sensations, then C-fibres\n    firing would be what actually causes pain sensations.\n\n9.  If the stuff that plays the gold role has atomic number 42, then\n    gold has atomic number 42.\n\n10. If the stuff that played the gold role had atomic number 42, gold\n    would have atomic number 42.\n\nIn (9) and (10) I assume that to play the gold role one must play it\nthroughout a large part of the world, and not just on a small stage.\nSomething may play the gold role in a small part of the world without\nbeing gold. Since there are pairs of conditionals like these where the\nindicative is appropriate, but the subjunctive is not, the explanation\nof the behaviour of rigid terms cannot rely on the fact that the\nantecedents of indicatives must be not known to be false. We will also\nneed a more traditional example of the differences between indicatives\nand subjunctives, as in (11) and (12).\n\n11. If Hinckley didn't shoot Reagan, someone else did.\n\n12. If Hinckley hadn't shot Reagan, someone else would have.\n\nI have concentrated on the examples involving rigidity because they seem\nto pose a deeper problem for unifying the theory of conditionals than\nthe presidential examples. As Jackson [-@Jackson1987 75] points out, one\ncan presumably explain (11) and (12) on a possible worlds account by\nvarying the similarity metric between indicatives and subjunctives, or\non a probabilistic account by varying the background evidence. It is\nunclear, however, how this will help with the rigidity examples. Assume,\nfor example, that C-fibres firing is not what causes pain sensations.\nStill, (7) seems true, but its consequent is false in all possible\nworlds. Therefore, the nearest world in which its antecedent is true is\na world in which its consequent is false, and on a simple possible\nworlds theory it should turn out false. On a simple probabilistic\naccount, the probability that C-fibres firing actually cause pain\nsensations given that they do is 1, whatever the background evidence, so\n(8) should turn out true, contrary to our intuitions. So while the\ndetails deal with the presidential examples, the structure of the theory\nmust deal with the rigidity examples.\n\nI will follow that strategy here. In section two I set out the framework\nof a unified possible worlds account of indicatives and subjunctives. In\nsection three I present my preferred way of filling out the details of\nthat framework. The framework deals with the differing behaviour of\nrigid designators in indicatives and subjunctives; the details deal with\nexamples like (11) and (12). One reason for dividing the presentation in\nthis way is to highlight the option of accepting the framework and\nfilling in the details in different ways.\n\n## The New Theory\n\n### Actually\n\nAs @Kripke1980 showed, the reference for some terms is fixed by what\nplays a particular role in the actual world. Even if it were the case\nthat XYZ fills the ocean, falls from the sky, is drinkable and\ntransparent and so on, for short is *watery*, it would still be the case\nthat water is H~2~O, not XYZ. For it would still be that H~2~O\n*actually* is watery. Whatever were the case, this world would be\nactual.\n\nYet, we want to have a way to talk about what would have happened had\nsome other world been actual. In particular, had the actual world been\none in which XYZ is watery, it would be true, indeed necessarily true,\nthat water is XYZ. Throughout the 1970s a number of methods for doing\nthis were produced. The following presentation is indebted to\n@Davies1980, but other approaches might have been used. The notation\n$\\vDash_y^x A$ is interpreted as '$A$ is true in world $y$ from the\nperspective of world $x$ as actual'. So, letting @ be the actual world\nand $w$ be a world in which only XYZ is watery, we can represent what\nwas said informally above as follows.\n\n> $\\vDash_@^@$ H~2~O is watery and H~2~O is water.\n>\n> $\\vDash_w^@$ XYZ is watery and H~2~O is water.\n>\n> $\\vDash_@^w$ H~2~O is watery and XYZ is water.\n>\n> $\\vDash_w^w$XYZ is watery and XYZ is water.\n\nNow as Kripke noted, it is necessary but *a posteriori* that water is\nH~2~O. Conversely, it is *a priori* but contingent that water is watery.\nThis is *a priori* because we knew before we determined what water\nreally is that it would be whatever plays the watery role in this world,\nthe actual world. In general $A$ is necessary iff, given this is the\nactual world, it is true in all worlds. And $A$ is *a priori* iff,\nwhatever the actual world turns out to be like, it makes $A$ true. So we\nget the following definitions.\n\n> $A$ is *a priori* iff for all worlds $w$, $\\vDash_w^w$ $A$.\n>\n> $A$ is necessary iff for all worlds $w$, $\\vDash_w^@$ $A$.\n\nThe connection between actuality and the *a priori* is important. It is\n*a priori* that we are in the actual world. Something is *a priori* iff\nit is true whenever the two indices are the same. If we regard possible\nworlds as sets of sentences, we can think of the sets {$A$:\n$\\vDash_x^x$ $A$} for each possible world $x$ as the epistemically\npossible worlds. Note that I don't make the set of epistemically\npossible worlds relative to an evidence set, as others commonly do.\nRather they are just the sets of sentences consistent with what we know\n*a priori*. More accurately, identify a world pair $\\langle x$,\n$y \\rangle$ with the set of {$A$: $\\vDash_y^x$ $A$}. Then\n$\\langle x$, $y \\rangle$ is an epistemically possible world pair iff\n$x$ = $y$.\n\nTo finish this formal excursion, we note the definition of 'Actually\n$A$'. Given what has been said so far, this needs no explanation.\n\n> $\\vDash_y^x$Actually $A$ iff $\\vDash_x^x$ $A$.\n\n### The Analysis of Indicatives\n\nNow we have the resources for my theory of the truth conditions for\nindicatives. I also give the parallel truth condition for subjunctives\nto show the similarities.\n\n> $\\vDash_@^@$$A \\rightarrow B$ iff the nearest possible world $x$\n> that $\\vDash_x^x$ $A$ is such that $\\vDash_x^x$ $B$.\n>\n> $\\vDash_@^@$ $A \\,\\square\\!\\mathord\\to B$ iff the nearest possible world $x$\n> that $\\vDash_x^@$ $A$ is such that $\\vDash_x^@$$B$.\n\nThese only cover the special case of what is true here from the\nperspective of this world as actual. We can partially generalise the\nanalysis of indicatives in one dimension as follows.\n\n> $\\vDash_w^w$ $A \\rightarrow B$ iff the nearest possible world $x$\n> to $w$ such that $\\vDash_x^x$ $A$ is such that $\\vDash_x^x$\n> $B$.\n\nI will make some comments below about how we might fully generalise the\nanalysis, but for now, I want to focus on these simpler cases. Note that\nstraight away this makes $A \\rightarrow$ Actually $A$ come out true, by\nthe definition of 'Actually'. If we allow ourselves quantification over\npropositions, we can give an analysis of 'things are different from the\nway they actually are', as follows:\n\n> ($\\vDash_y^x$ Things are different from the way they actually\n> are) iff\\\n> ($\\exists$$p$: $\\vDash_y^x$ $p$ and not $\\vDash_x^x$ $p$)\n\nSince nothing both is and is not the case in $x$ from the perspective of\n$x$ as actual, this can never be true when $y$ is $x$. This explains why\nit can never serve as the consequent of an indicative conditional.\n\n### Motivations\n\nThe theory outlined here is reasonably unified, and accounts for the\nrigidity phenomena, but without any further justification, the resort to\ntwo-dimensional modal logic is *ad hoc*. This subsection responds to\nthat problem with some independent motivations for the theory. In\nparticular I argue that this theory best captures the well-known\nepistemic feel of the indicative conditional.\n\nEver since @Ramsey1929 most theorists have held that there is an\nepistemic element to indicatives. Here is Ramsey's sketch of an analysis\nof indicatives.\n\n> If two people are arguing 'If $p$ will *q*?' and are both in doubt as\n> to $p$, they are adding $p$ hypothetically to their stock of knowledge\n> and arguing on that basis about *q*; so that in a sense 'If $p$, *q*'\n> and 'If $p$, $\\neg$*q*' are contradictories [@Ramsey1929 247n].\n\nNothing of the sort could be true about subjunctives. What is in our\n'stock of knowledge', or the contextually relevant knowledge, makes at\nmost an indirect contribution to the truth- value of a subjunctive. It\nmakes an indirect contribution because the common knowledge might affect\nthe context, which in turn determines the similarity measure. But given\na context, a subjunctive makes a broadly metaphysical claim, an\nindicative a broadly epistemic claim. Hence, the relationship between\nthe indicative and subjunctive should parallel the relationship between\nthe necessary and the *a priori*. As should be clear, this is exactly\nwhat happens on this theory.\n\nThe close similarity between the indicative/subjunctive distinction and\nthe *a priori*/necessary distinction can be demonstrated in other ways.\nFor example, corresponding to the contingent *a priori* (13) the\nindicative (14) is true, but the subjunctive (15) is false. And\ncorresponding to the necessary *a posteriori* (16) the subjunctive (17)\nis true but the indicative (18) is false. (I am assuming that it is part\nof the definitions of the water role and the fire role that nothing can\nplay both roles.)\n\n13. Water is what plays the water role.\n\n14. If XYZ plays the water role, XYZ is water.\n\n15. If XYZ played the water role, it would be water.\n\n16. Water is H~2~O.\n\n17. If all H~2~O played the fire role, all water would be fire.\n\n18. If all H~2~O plays the fire role, all water is fire.\n\nThis suggests the analysis sketched here is not *ad hoc* at all, but\nfollows naturally from considerations about the necessary and *a\npriori*. These sketchy considerations might not provide much positive\nsupport for my theory. The main evidence for the theory, however, is the\nway it manages the hard cases, particularly cases involving rigid\ndesignation. What these considerations show is that the correct theory\nof indicatives may invoke the resources of two-dimensional modal logic\nwithout automatically renouncing any claim to systematicity.\n\n## The Details\n\nIn this section, I want to look at four questions. First, what can we\nsay about the similarity measure at the core of this account? Secondly,\nhow should we generalise the theory to cover cases where the definite\ndescription in the analysis appears to denote nothing? Thirdly, how\nshould we generalise the theory to cover cases where the two indices\ndiffer? Finally, how should we draw the line between indicatives and\nsubjunctives? If what I said in the previous section is correct, there\nshould be something to say about each of these questions, and what is\nsaid should be motivated. While it is not important that what I say here\nis precisely true, I do hope that it is.\n\n### Nearness\n\nIdeally, we could use exactly the same similarity metric for both\nindicatives and subjunctives. The existence of pairs like (11) and (12)\nsuggests this is impossible. So we must come up with a pair of measures\non the worlds satisfying three constraints. First, the measure for\nsubjunctives must deliver plausible verdicts for most subjunctive\nconditionals. Secondly, the measure for indicatives must deliver\nplausible verdicts for most indicative conditionals. Thirdly, the\nmeasures must be similar enough that we can explain the close\nrelationship between indicatives and subjunctives set out in section\none. The theory of section two requires that these objectives be jointly\nsatisfiable. I will attempt to demonstrate that they are by outlining a\npair of measures satisfying all three.\n\n@Lewis1979c provides the measure for subjunctives. He suggests the\nfollowing four rules for locating the nearest possible world in which\n*A* is true.\n\n1.  It is of the first importance to avoid big, widespread, diverse\n    violations of law.\n\n2.  It is of the second importance to maximise the spatio-temporal\n    region throughout which perfect match of particular fact prevails.\n\n3.  It is of the third importance to avoid even small, localized, simple\n    violations of law.\n\n4.  It is of little or no importance to secure approximate similarity of\n    particular fact, even in matters that concern us greatly.\n    [@Lewis1979c 47-8]\n\nThe right measure for indicatives is somewhat simpler. Notice that\nwhenever we know that $A \\supset B$ and don't know whether $A$,\n$A \\rightarrow B$ seems true. More generally, if I know some sentence\n$S$ such that $A$ and $S$ together entail $B$, and I would continue to\nknow $S$ even were I to come to doubt $B$, then $A \\rightarrow B$ will\nseem true to me. No matter how good a card cheat I know Sly Pete to be,\nif I know that he has the worse hand, and that whenever someone with the\nworse hand calls they lose, it will seem true to me that *If Sly Pete\ncalls, he will lose*. Further, if someone else knows these background\nfacts and tells me that *If Sly Pete calls, he will lose*, she speaks\ntruthfully.\n\nThis data suggests that whenever there is a true $S$ such that $A$ and\n$S$ entail $B$, $A \\rightarrow B$ is true. But this would mean\n$A \\rightarrow B$ is true whenever $A \\supset B$ is true, which seems\nincredible. On this theory it is true that *If there is a nuclear war\ntomorrow, life will go on as normal*. There are some very subtle\nattempts to make this palatable. The 'Supplemented Equivalence Theory'\nin @Jackson1987 may even be successful. But two problems remain for all\ntheories saying $A \\rightarrow B$ has the truth value of $A \\supset B$.\nFirst, they make some apparently true negated conditionals turn out\nfalse, such as *It is not true that if there is a nuclear war tomorrow,\nlife will go on as normal*. It is hard to see how an appeal to Gricean\npragmatics will avoid this problem. Secondly, such theories fail the\nthird task we set ourselves at the start of the section: explaining the\nclose connections between indicatives and subjunctives.\n\nSo we might be tempted to try a different path. Let's take the data at\nface value and say that $A \\rightarrow B$ is true in a context if there\nis some $S$ such that some person in that context knows $S$, and $A$ and\n$S$ together entail $B$. We can formalise this claim as follows. Let\n$d$($x$, $y$) be the 'distance' from $x$ to $y$. This function will\nsatisfy few of the formal properties of a distance relationship, so\nremember this is just an analogy. Let **K** be the set of all\npropositions $S$ known by someone in the context, $W$ the set of all\npossible worlds, and $i$ the impossible world, where everything is true.\nThen $d$: $W \\times W \\cup \\{i\\} \\rightarrow \\Re$ is as follows:\n\n> If $y = x$ then $d$($x$, $y$) = 0\n>\n> If $y \\in W, y \\neq x$ and $\\forall S$: $S \\in$ **K**\n> $\\supset \\vDash_y^y$ $S$, then $d$($x$, $y$) = 1\n>\n> If $y$ = $i$ then $d$($x$, $y$) = 2\n>\n> Otherwise, $d$($x$, $y$) = 3\n\nLess formally, the nearest world to a world is itself. The next closest\nworlds are any compatible with everything known in the context, then the\nimpossible world, then the possible worlds incompatible with something\nknown in the context. It may seem odd to have the impossible world\ncloser than some possible worlds, but there are two reasons for doing\nthis. First, in the impossible world everything known to any\nconversational participant is true. Secondly, putting the impossible\nworld at this position accounts for some examples. This is a variant on\na well known case; see for example @Gibbard1981 and @Barker1997.\n\nJack and Jill are trying to find out how their local representative Kim,\na Democrat from Texas, voted on a resolution at a particular committee\nmeeting. So far, they have not even found out whether Kim was at the\nmeeting. Jack finds out that all Democrats at the meeting voted against\nthe resolution; Jill finds out that all Texans at the meeting voted for\nit. When they return to compare notes, Jack can truly say *If Kim was at\nthe meeting, she voted against the resolution*, and Jill can truly say\n*If Kim was at the meeting, she voted for the resolution*. If $i$ is\nfurther from the actual world than some possible world where Kim\nattended the meeting, these statements cannot both be true.\n\nIt may be thought the distance function needs to be more fine-grained to\naccount for the following phenomena[^2]. It seems possible that in each\nof the following pairs, the first sentence is true and the second false.\n\n19. 1.  If Anne goes to the party, so will Billy.\n\n    2.  If Anne goes to the party, Billy will not go.\n\n20. 1.  If Anne and Carly go to the party, Billy will not go.\n\n    2.  If Anne and Carly go to the party, so will Billy.\n\n21. 1.  If Anne, Carly and Donna go to the party, so will Billy.\n\n    2.  If Anne, Carly and Donna go to the party, Billy will not.\n\nAssume, as seems plausible, it is necessary and sufficient for\n$A \\rightarrow B$ to be true that the nearest $A \\wedge B$ world is\ncloser than the nearest $A\\wedge \\neg B$ world. (This does not\nimmediately follow from the analysis in section 2, but is obviously\ncompatible with it.) Given this, there is no context in which the first\nconditional in each pair is true, and the second false. @McCawley1996\npoints out a way to accommodate these intuitions. Every time a\nconditional is uttered, or considered in a private context, the context\nshifts so as to accommodate the possibility that its antecedent is true.\nSo at first we don't consider worlds where Carly or Donna turn up, and\nagree that (19a) is true and (19b) false because in those worlds Billy\nloyally follows Anne to the party. When (20a) or (20b) is uttered, or\nconsidered, we have to allow some worlds where Carly goes to the party\ninto the context set. In some of these worlds Anne goes to the party and\nBilly doesn't, the worlds where Carly goes to party. A similar story\nexplains how (21a) can be true despite (20b) being false.[^3]\n\nThis move does seem to save the theory from potentially troubling data,\nbut without further support it may seems rather desperate. There are two\nindependent motivations for it. First, it explains the inappropriateness\nof (6).\n\n6.  \\*Grannie won, but if she lost she was furious.\n\nIf assertion narrows the contextually relevant worlds to those where the\nassertion is true, as @Stalnaker1978 suggests, and uttering a\nconditional requires expanding the context to include worlds where the\nantecedent is true, it follows that utterances like (6) will be\ndefective. The speech acts performed by uttering each clause give the\nhearer opposite instructions regarding how to amend the context set.\nSecondly, McCawley's assumption explains why we generally have little\nuse for indicative conditionals whose antecedents we know are false. To\ninterpret an indicative we first have to expand the context set to\ninclude a world where the antecedent is true, but if we know the\nantecedent is false we usually have little reason to want to do that. If\nthere is a dispute over the size of the context set, we may want to\nexpand it so as to avoid miscommunication, which explains why we will\nsometimes assert conditionals with antecedents we know to be false when\ntrying to convince someone else that the antecedent really is false.\n\nSo we have a pair of measures that give plausible answers on a wide\nrange of cases. Such a pair should also validate the close connection\nbetween indicatives and subjunctives we saw earlier. The data set out in\nsection one suggests that this connection may be close to synonymy, as\nin (1), but in some cases, as in (11) and (12), the connection is much\nlooser. The differing behaviour of rigid designators in indicatives and\nsubjunctives reveals a further difference, but the two-dimensional\nnature of the analysis, not the particulars of the similarity metric,\naccounts for that. I propose to explain the data by looking at which\nfacts we hold fixed when trying to determine the nearest possible world.\nThe facts we hold fixed in evaluating indicatives and subjunctives,\naccording to the two metrics outlined above, are the same in just the\ncases we feel that the indicatives and subjunctives say the same thing.\n\nWhen evaluating an indicative we hold fixed all the facts known by any\nmember of the conversation. When evaluating a subjunctive we hold fixed\n(a) all facts about the world up to some salient time *t* and (b) the\nholding of the laws of nature at all times after *t*. The time *t* is\nthe latest time such that some worlds fitting this description make $A$\ntrue and contain no large miracles. The two sets of facts held fixed\nmatch when we know all the salient facts about times before *t*, and\nknow no particular facts about what happens after *t*.\n\nIn the opinion poll case, when evaluating the original indicative our\nknowledge at the earlier time was held fixed. We knew that the polls\npredicted a Reagan landslide, that when one makes spectacularly false\npredictions one is discredited, and so on. When we turn to evaluating\nthe subjunctive, we hold fixed the facts about the world before the\nelection (presumably the relevant time *t*) and some laws. Therefore, we\nhold fixed the polls predictions, and the law that when one makes\nspectacularly false predictions one is discredited. So the same facts\nare held fixed. And in general, this will happen whenever all we know is\nall the specific facts up to the relevant time, and some laws that allow\nus to extrapolate from those facts.\n\nIn the case where indicatives and subjunctives come apart, as in (11)\nand (12), the relevant knowledge differs from the first case. By\nhypothesis, we do not know who pulled the trigger, but we do know that a\ntrigger was pulled. Our knowledge of the relevant facts does not consist\nin knowledge of all the details up to a salient time, and knowledge that\nthe world will continue in a law-governed way after this. Therefore, we\nwould predict that the indicatives and subjunctives would come apart,\nbecause what is held fixed when evaluating the two conditionals differs.\nWe find exactly that. So the pair of measures can explain the close\nconnection between indicatives and subjunctives when it exists, and\nexplain why the two come apart when they do come apart.\n\n### No Nearest Possible World\n\nGenerally, there are three kinds of problems under this heading. First,\nthere may be no $A$-worlds, and so no nearest $A$-world. Secondly, there\nmay be an infinite sequence of ever-nearer $A$-worlds without a nearest\n$A$-world. Thirdly, there may be several worlds in a tie for nearest\n$A$-world. If the measure suggested in the previous section is correct,\nthe first two problems do not arise here. The third problem, however,\narises almost all the time, so we need to say something about it.\n\nThe approach I favour is set out in @Stalnaker1981. The comparative\nsimilarity measure is a partial order on the possible worlds. Stalnaker\nrecommends we assess conditionals using supervaluations, taking the\nprecisifications to be the complete extensions of this partial order. In\nparticular, if several possible worlds tie for being the closest\n$A$-worlds[^4], then $A \\rightarrow B$ will be true if they are all\n$B$-worlds, false if they are all $\\neg B$-worlds, and not truth-valued\notherwise. For consistent $A$, this makes $\\neg$($A \\rightarrow B$)\nequivalent to $A \\rightarrow \\neg B$. Since we generally deny\n$A \\rightarrow B$ just when we would be prepared to assert\n$A \\rightarrow \\neg B$, this seems like a good outcome.[^5] Further,\nthis account makes $A \\rightarrow B$ generally come out gappy when *A*\nis false. Many theorists hold that indicative conditionals, especially\nthose with false antecedents, lack truth values.[^6] This can't be right\nin general, since it is a platitude that $A \\rightarrow A$ is true for\nevery $A$, but the position has some attraction. Happily, our theory\nrespects the motivations behind such positions without violating the\nplatitude.\n\nIn any case, these details are not important to the overall analysis. If\nsomeone favours a resolution of ties along the lines Lewis suggested\nthis could easily be appended onto the basic theory.\n\n### The General Theory\n\nSo far, I have just defined what it is for $A \\rightarrow B$ to be true\nin this world from the perspective of this world as actual. To have a\nfully general theory I need to say when $A \\rightarrow B$ is true in an\narbitrary world from the perspective of another (possibly different)\nworld as actual. And that general theory must yield the theory above as\na special case when applied to our world. As with the special theory\nabove, the general theory will mostly be derived from Twin Earth\nconsiderations.\n\nIn general, $\\vDash_y^x$ $A \\rightarrow B$ iff the nearest world\npair $\\langle z, v \\rangle$ such that $\\vDash_v^z$ $A$ is such that\n$\\vDash_v^z$ $B$. Nearness is again defined epistemically, but what\n*we* know about $x$ and $y$ matters. In particular if $\\vDash_v^z$\n$C$ for all sentences $C$ such that someone in the context knows that\n$\\vDash_y^x$$C$ , but not $\\vDash_w^u$ $C$ for some such $C$ ,\nthen $\\langle z, v \\rangle$ is closer to $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ than is\n$\\langle u, w \\rangle$. As should be clear from this, nearness is\ncontext-dependent, and the context it depends on is the actual speaker's\ncontext. For conditionals as for quantified sentences, the same words\nwill express different propositions in different contexts.\n\nLet's draw out some consequences of this definition. First, for any $x$\nwe know that $\\vDash_x^x$ $C$ for all *a priori* propositions $C$.\nIn particular, we know that $\\vDash_x^x$$D \\equiv$ (Actually $D$)\nfor any proposition $D$, where '$\\equiv$' represents the material\nbiconditional. So the nearest world pair $\\langle z, v \\rangle$ to\n$\\langle x, x \\rangle$ must be one in which $z = v$, even if that means\n$z$ is the impossible world $i$. Hence the general theory of indicatives\nreduces to the special theory set out above when applied to\nepistemically possible worlds: when assessing the truth value of an\nindicative in an epistemically possible world pair we need only look at\nother epistemically possible world pairs.\n\nSecondly, when evaluating conditionals with respect to epistemically\nimpossible world pairs $\\langle x, y \\rangle$, we need to use other\nepistemically impossible world pairs. For example, imagine some\nexplorers are wandering around Twin Australia, a dry continent to the\nsouth of Twin Earth. As explorers of such lands are wont to do, they are\ndying of thirst, so they are seeking some watery stuff to save\nthemselves. Without knowing whether they succeed, we know (22) is false.\n\n22. If the explorers find some watery stuff, they will find some water.\n\nThis theory can explain the falsity of (22). We know, from the way Twin\nEarth is stipulated, that all the watery stuff of the explorers'\nacquaintance is not water. So we know any watery stuff they find will\nnot be water. And we know that water is scarce on Twin Earth, even\nscarcer than watery stuff in Twin Australia, so it is unlikely they will\nfind some watery stuff and simultaneously stumble across some water.\n\nThis theory also explains occurrences of indicatives embedded in\nsubjunctives. These are very odd, as should be expected if indicatives\nare about epistemic connections and subjunctives about metaphysical\nconnections, but we can just make sense of them some of the time. For\nexample, it seems possible to make sense of (23) and that it is true.\n\n23. If the bullet that actually killed JFK had instead killed Jackie\n    Kennedy, then it would be true that if Oswald didn't kill Jackie\n    Kennedy, someone else did.\n\nOn our theory, to evaluate this we first find the nearest world pair\n$\\langle @, w \\rangle$ such that $\\vDash_w^@$ The bullet that\nactually killed JFK instead killed Jackie Kennedy, and then evaluate the\nindicative relative to it. Now one thing we know about this world pair\nis that in it, someone killed Jackie Kennedy. So this must hold in all\nnearby world pairs. Hence in any such world pair that Oswald did not\nkill Jackie Kennedy, someone else did, so (23) turns out true.\n\nIt might be thought that such embeddings do not make particularly good\nsense. I have some sympathy for such a view. If one adopts the 'special\ntheory' developed in the previous section, and rejects the general\ntheory developed in this subsection, one may have an explanation for the\nimpossibility of such embeddings. However, even if we cannot make sense\nof such embeddings, we still need to account for the truth conditions of\nindicatives relative to epistemically impossible world pairs to make\nsense of claims such as *Necessarily* ($A \\rightarrow A$).[^7]\n\n### Classifying Conditionals\n\nIn recent years, there has been extensive debate over where the line\nbetween indicatives and subjunctives falls. This debate focuses on\nwhether 'future indicatives' like (24) are properly classified with\nindicatives or subjunctives.\n\n24. If Booth doesn't shoot Lincoln, someone else will.\n\n@Jackson1990 and @Bennett1995 argue that this should go with ordinary\nindicatives. @Dudman1994 and @Bennett1988 argue that it should go with\nordinary subjunctives, though this is not how Dudman would put it. This\ntheory of indicatives appears to favour Jackson and (the later) Bennett,\nbecause of the apparent triviality of conditionals like (25).\n\n25. If it will rain then it will actually rain.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite its lack of attention in the literature, data about the role of\nrigid designators in indicatives deserve close attention. Any plausible\ntheory of indicatives must be able to deal with it, and it isn't clear\nhow existing possible worlds theories could do so. The easiest way to\nbuild a semantics for indicatives is to say that \"If $A$ then $C$ \" is\ntrue just in case the nearest world in which $A$ is true is a world\nwhere $C$ is true. Even before the hard questions about the meaning of\n'nearest' here start to be asked, we know a theory of this form is wrong\nbecause it makes mistaken predictions about the role of rigid\ndesignators. A conditional like \"If the stuff in the rivers, lakes and\noceans really is XYZ, then water is XYZ\" is *true*, even though the\nconsequent is true in no possible worlds. The simplest way to solve this\ndifficulty is to revisit the idea of 'true in a world'. Rather than\nlooking for a nearby world in which $A$ is true, and asking whether $C$\nis true in it, we look for a nearby world $w$ such that $A$ is true\nunder the supposition that $w$ is actual, and ask whether $C$ is true\nunder the supposition that $w$ is actual. In the terminology of\n@Jackson1998, we look at worlds considered as actual, rather than worlds\nconsidered as counterfactual. This simple change makes an important\ndifference to the way rigid designators behave. There is no world in\nwhich water is XYZ. However, under the supposition that the stuff in the\nrivers, lakes and oceans really is XYZ, and the H~2~O theory is just a\ngiant mistake, that is, under the supposition that we are in the world\nknown as Twin Earth, water is XYZ. In short, \"water is XYZ\" is true in\nTwin Earth *considered as actual*, even though it is false in Twin Earth\nconsidered as counterfactual. So the data about behaviour of rigid\ndesignators in indicatives, data like the truth of \"If the stuff in the\nrivers, lakes and oceans really is XYZ, then water is XYZ\", does not\nrefute the hypothesis that \"If $A$ then $C$ \" is true iff the nearest\nworld such that $A$ is true in that world considered as actual is a\nworld where $C$ is true in that world considered as actual.\n\nIn section two we looked at how the formal structure of a theory built\naround that hypothesis might look. In section three we looked at how\nsome of the details may be filled in. The most pressing task is to\nprovide a similarity metric so we can have some idea about which worlds\nwill count as being nearby. The theory I defended has three important\nfeatures. First, it is *epistemic*. Which worlds are nearby depends on\nwhat is known by conversational participants. Secondly, it is\n*contextualist* in two respects. The first respect is that it is the\nknowledge of the audience that matters, not just the knowledge of the\nspeaker and the intended audience. The second respect is that it allows\nthat what is known by the audience may be affected by the utterance of\nthe conditional. In particular, if the utterance of \"If $A$, $B$\" causes\nthe audience to consider $A$ to be possible, and hence cease to know\nthat $\\neg A$, then $A$ is not part of what is known for purposes of\ndetermining which worlds are nearby. (I assume here a broadly\ncontextualist account of knowledge, as in @Lewis1996b, but this is\ninessential. If you do not like Lewis's theory, replace all references\nto knowledge here, and in section 3.1, with references to epistemic\ncertainty. I presume that what is epistemically certain really is\ncontextually variable in the way Lewis suggests.) Thirdly, it is\n*coarse- grained*: whether a world is nearby depends only on whether it\nis consistent with what is known, not 'how much' it agrees with what is\nknown. The resultant theory seems to capture all the data, to explain\nthe generally close connection between indicatives and subjunctives, and\nto explain the few differences which do arise between indicatives and\nsubjunctives.\n\nThe other detail to be filled in concerns embeddings of indicatives\ninside subjunctives. The formalism here requires that we use the full\nresources of two- dimensional modal logic, but the basic idea is very\nsimple. Consider a sentence of the form \"If it were the case that $A$,\nit would be the case that if $B$, $C$ .\" Roughly, this will be true iff\nthe metaphysically nearest world in which $A$ is true, call it $w_A$, is\na world where $B \\rightarrow C$ is true. And that will be true iff the\nepistemically nearest world to $w_A$ is which $B$ is true is a world\nwhere $C$ is true. Less roughly, we have to quantify not over worlds,\nbut over pairs of worlds, where the first element of the pair determines\nthe reference for rigid designators, and the second element determines\nthe truth of sentences given those references. But this only adds to the\nformal complexity; the underlying idea is still the same. The important\nphilosophical point to note is that when we are trying to find the\nepistemically nearest world to $w_A$ (or, more strictly, the nearest\nworld pair to $\\langle @, w_A \\rangle$) the facts that have to be held\nfixed are the facts that we know about $w_A$, not what our counterparts\nin $w_A$, or indeed what any inhabitant of $w_A$ knows about their\nworld. These embeddings may be rare in everyday speech, but since they\nare our best guide to the truth values of indicatives in other possible\nworlds, they are theoretically very important.\n\n[^1]: An anonymous reviewer for Philosophical Quarterly suggested this\n    point.\n\n[^2]: @Lewis1973a makes this objection to a similar proposal for\n    subjunctives; the objection has just as much force here as it does\n    in the original case.\n\n[^3]: There is an obvious similarity between this argument and some of\n    the uses of contextual dependence in Lewis's theory of knowledge\n    [@Lewis1996b]. Indeed, McCawley credits @Lewis1979f as an\n    inspiration for his ideas.\n\n[^4]: Of course in this context $x$ is an $A$- world iff\n    $\\vDash_x^x$ $A$.\n\n[^5]: @Edgington1996 furnishes some nice examples against the view that\n    $A \\,\\square\\!\\mathord\\to B$ should be false when there are several equally close\n    $A$-worlds in a tie for closest and some are $B$-worlds but some are\n    $\\neg B$-worlds.\n\n[^6]: See @Edgington1995 for an endorsement of this position and\n    discussion of others who have held it.\n\n[^7]: I am indebted to Lloyd Humberstone for pointing this out to me.\n",
