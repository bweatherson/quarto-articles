As Jonathan @Ichikawa2012 shows, most of these\nattempts rest on further, and arguably false, assumptions about the\nconnection between reasons and action. Relatedly, most of those\nresponses concern the role of knowledge and reasons in decision-making.\nI'll argue that we can formulate a sharper problem for the principle if\nwe focus on game-playing, and say exactly which extra assumptions we are\nmaking.\n\n<aside>\nPublished in [The Reasoner](https://cdn-researchkent.pressidium.com/reasoning/wp-content/uploads/sites/1804/2019/06/TheReasoner-61.pdf) 6: 6-7.\n\nPicture by [Kh√°nh Hmoong](https://www.flickr.com/photos/7997148@N05) via [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/04e3d394-c6d4-4501-a042-4a0009a0aca6).\n</aside>\n\nThe Reason-Knowledge Principle should have the following implications,\nat least for cases where $S$'s aim is to produce the best outcome.\n\n1.  If $S$ knows that $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ will produce the same\n    outcome, and $S$ must choose $\\varphi$ or $\\psi$, then it is\n    rationally permissible for $S$ to choose $\\psi$.\n\n2.  If $S$ knows that $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ will produce the same outcome\n    if $p$, and $\\varphi$ will produce a better outcome if $\\neg p$,\n    then it is rationally permissible for $S$ to choose $\\psi$ iff she\n    knows $p$.\n\nThe point of (1) is that $S$ can use her knowledge that $\\varphi$ and\n$\\psi$ will produce the same outcome to justify making an arbitrary\nchoice between $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$. And the point of (2) is that the\nReason-Knowledge Principle suggests only knowledge that $p$ could\njustify ignoring the fact that $\\psi$ does worse than $\\varphi$ if\n$\\neg p$.\n\nDefine a **symmetric** game as having these features:\n\n-   The game is purely co-operative; each player gets the same payoffs;\n\n-   Each player knows nothing about the other save that it is common\n    knowledge the players are rational, and hence know what each other's\n    rational requirements are;\n\n-   Each player has the same moves available; and,\n\n-   The payoffs are a function of just which moves are made, not of who\n    makes them.\n\nAssume $A$ and $B$ are playing a symmetric game, and it is common\nknowledge which symmetric game they are playing. Then the following\npremise seems hard to dispute:\n\n3.  It is rationally required for $A$ to play $\\varphi$ iff $A$ knows\n    $B$ will play $\\varphi$.\n\nWhat makes (3) so compelling is that we can derive it from (4), (5) and\n(6).\n\n4.  $A$ knows that $B$ will play $\\varphi$ iff $A$ knows that any\n    rational player will play $\\varphi$.\n\n5.  If $A$ knows any rational player will play $\\varphi$, then $A$ is\n    rationally required to play $\\varphi$.\n\n6.  If $A$ is rationally required to play $\\varphi$, then $A$ knows that\n    any rational player will play $\\varphi$.\n\nWe get (4) from the fact that $A$ knows nothing about $B$ save that she\nis rational. We get (5) by the factivity of knowledge. And we get (6) by\nthe requirement that the players are rational, and hence know what\nrationality requires of each player. And these three together entail\n(3). So (3) is true, and (1) and (2) are entailed by the\nReason-Knowledge Principle. Unfortunately, (1), (2) and (3) are\ninconsistent, as we'll now show.\n\nInformally, in this game $A$ and $B$ must each play either a green or\nred card. I will capitalise $A$'s moves, i.e., $A$ can play GREEN or\nRED, and italicise $B$'s moves, i.e., $B$ can play *green* or *red*. If\ntwo green cards, or one green card and one red card are played, each\nplayer gets \\$1. If two red cards are played, each gets nothing. Each\ncares just about their own wealth, so getting \\$1 is worth 1 util. All\nof this is common knowledge. More formally, here is the game table, with\n$A$ on the row and $B$ on the column.\n\n::: {.center}\n  ------- --------- -------\n           *green*   *red*\n    GREEN   1, 1     1, 1\n      RED   1, 1     0, 0\n  ------- --------- -------\n:::\n\nAssume $A$ knows $B$ will play *green*. By (3), it is rationally\nrequired that $A$ plays GREEN. But $A$ can use this knowledge of $B$ to\ndeduce that GREEN and RED have the same payoff. So by (1), it is\nrationally permissible to play RED. Contradiction.\n\nNow assume $A$ does not know $B$ will play *green*. By (3), it is not a\nrational requirement that $A$ plays GREEN. But $A$ knows that GREEN does\nbetter than RED unless $B$ plays *green*. And since she doesn't know $B$\nplays *green*, by (2), she's required to play GREEN. Contradiction.\n\nSo either assuming that $A$ does or does not know that it is rationally\nrequired for $B$ to play *green* leads to a contradiction given (1), (2)\nand (3). So these three premises are inconsistent. Since (3) is true,\nthat means (1) or (2) is false. And since the Reason-Knowledge principle\nentails those two premises, one of which is false, the Reason-Knowledge\nPrinciple is false.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which of (1) and (2) is false; both of them do\nfeel plausible. I suspect the problem is (1). Assume $A$ deduces from\npremises she believes that rational players will play a green card.\nPerhaps she agrees with Robert @Stalnaker1998 that rationality requires\navoiding weakly dominated options. Then she knows it doesn't matter to\nher outcome whether she plays GREEN or RED; she will get \\$1 either way.\nBut if she plays RED, she is incoherent; she is doing something she\nthinks no rational player does. And perhaps this incoherence is a bad\nthing in itself. Niko @Kolodny2005 argues that incoherence is not bad in\nitself; Jacob @Ross2012 argues that it is. The suggestion that (1) is\nthe false premise favours Ross's view over Kolodny's. But this\nconclusion is very speculative; the main thing I wanted to note was the\nproblem this game raises for the Reason-Knowledge Principle.\n",
