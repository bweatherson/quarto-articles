# Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 medium zucchinis, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 5 cups)
- 2 large garlic cloves, grated
- salt
- red-pepper flakes
- 12 oz orzo
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1 (5-ounce) can olive-oil packed tuna, drained
- 1/4 cup golden raisins
- 3 Tbsp capers
- 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, torn
- 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, torn
- grated Pecorino Romano, for serving (optional)

## Step 1

In a large, high-sided skillet, heat the oil over high. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring often, until browned, about 6 minutes.

## Step 2

Adjust heat to medium, stir in the garlic and season with salt and red pepper. (Do not let the garlic burn.) Add the orzo and cook for 1 minute, stirring. Stir in the broth and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until the orzo is tender and the liquid is almost absorbed, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.

## Step 3

Stir in the tuna, raisins, capers and vinegar and cook until just warmed through. Add the herbs right before serving. Top with cheese if desired.
