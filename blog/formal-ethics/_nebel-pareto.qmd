title: "Infinite Worlds and the Intransitivity of Indifference"
abstract: |
 Jake Nebel has a really nice example that he thinks shows that a kind of impartiality is impossible in infinite cases. I think it shows something else, namely that infinite worlds give us another reason to reject the transitivity of indifference.

Jake @Nebel2025 has a nice argument coming out in *Noûs* against the possibility of having agent-neutral values in certain infinite worlds. That's to say, he has a proof that in infinite cases a bunch of plausible principles turn out to be inconsistent, one of them being the possibility of agent-neutral values. He argues that's the one of the inconsistent set we should reject.

I'm going to use his example to argue for a different conclusion. I think these cases provide another reason to reject the transitivity of indifference.

# Nebel's Example

Here is the main case that Nebel uses.^[His example draws on @Goodsell2021.] We have a world consisting of a countable infinity of people, *a*~1~, *a*~2~, …, *b*~1~, *b*~2~, ….^[Actually all that matters is that these people are in the world. There could be other people who are not affected by any actions in what follows. I'll come back to this point. Each of these people has one of two possible welfare states, which we'll denote as 0 and 1. We'll say an outcome is any assignment of a probability distribution of welfare payouts to each individual.^[This means that we're not going to consider what happens if the world population changes; that raises a whole host of different concerns.]

One of four lotteries will take place. The lotteries are shown in @tbl-nebel. In each lottery, there are two random devices that contribute to the state. The first is a fair [red]{.text-red} coin which will be flipped once. The second is a fair coin that will be flipped indefinitely until it lands heads. We'll write [H]{.text-red} and [T]{.text-red} for the [red]{.text-red} coin landing heads and tails respectively, and H~*i*~ for the proposition that the other coin will be flipped *i* times. (For completeness, say that H~1~ also includes the possibility that it lands tails every time.) So we have the states shown in the top row of @tbl-nebel, with their probability below them. In each cell, we show the people who get payout 1 in that state from that lottery; everyone else gets payout 0.

: Nebel's example {#tbl-nebel}
:::

Now assume that that for each person *x* we have relations of strict preference ≻~*x*~ and indifference &#126;~*x*~, and from a society wide perspective a social welfare ordering, i.e., a pair of relations of strict preference ≻~∀~ and indifference \~~∀~. We'll also assume that no matter the subscript, that \~ is symmetric and ≻ is asymmetric, and that for any options *A* and *B*, *A* ≻ *B*, *A* \~ *B* and *B* ≻ *A* are exclusive and exhaustive.

We'll also assume that each individual prefers a higher probability of getting 1 to a lower probability, and is indifferent between any two states with the same probability of getting 1.

Nebel then derives a contradiction from the following assumptions.

Transitivity of Social Indifference
:    If *A* &#126;~∀~ *B* and *B* &#126;~∀~ *C* then *A* \~~∀~ *C*.

Pareto Indifference
:    If *A* &#126;~*x*~ *B* for all *x*, then *A* \~~∀~ *B*.

Pareto Strict Preference
:    If *A* ≻~*x*~ *B* for all *x*, then *A* ≻~∀~ *B*.

Pairwise Anonymity
:    For outcome *O* and individual *x*, write *O~x~* for the outcome individual *x* gets in *O*. For any outcomes *A* and *B* if there are two individuals *i* and *j* such that *A~i~* &#126;~*i*~ *B*~j~ and *A~j~* &#126;~*j*~ *B*~i~, and for all other individuals *h*, *A~h~* &#126;~*h*~ *B*~h~, then *A* &#126;~∀~ *B*.

Lottery Indifference
:    For any two lotteries *A* and *B* defined over the same partition of the possibilities in states, if in each state *A* &#126;~∀~ *B*, then prior to the lottery taking place, *A* &#126;~∀~ *B*.

We now reason as follows.

First, to prove *Q*ʹ ≻~∀~ *Q*. Note that each individual has a higher probability of getting 1 in *Q*ʹ than *Q*. So *Q*ʹ ≻~*x*~ *Q* for all *x*, so by Pareto Strict Preference, *Q*ʹ ≻~∀~ *Q*.

Second, to prove *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*. In each result of the lottery, the same number of people get 1. So in each state, a finite number of applications of Pairwise Anonymity plus one use of Pareto Indifference we have *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P* conditional on each state of the lottery. So by Lottery Indifference, *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*.

Third, to prove *P* &#126;~∀~ *P*ʹ. Each individual has the same probability of getting 1 in each lottery, so each individual is indifferent between the lotteries, so by Pareto Indifference, *P* &#126;~∀~ *P*ʹ.

Fourth, to prove *P*ʹ &#126;~∀~ *Q*ʹ. Here it is the same reasoning as in step 2. No matter what lottery outcome we're in, the same number of people get payout 1 in *P*ʹ as *Q*ʹ, so by many (but in each state a finite number of) applications of Pairwise Anonymity plus one use of Pareto Indifference we have *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P* conditional on each state of the lottery. So by Lottery Indifference, *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*.

Fifth, by two applications of Transitivity of Indifference we get from *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*, *P* &#126;~∀~ *P*ʹ, and *P*ʹ &#126;~∀~ *Q*ʹ to *Q* &#126;~∀~ *Q*ʹ, contradicting *Q*ʹ ≻~∀~ *Q*.

Nebel argues that the culprit here is Pairwise Anonymity. He argues that his means that a certain kind of impartial benevolence is impossible. I'm going to argue that it's really the transitivity assumption we should give up.

# Background Ideology

Nebel sets out the example using, as most philosophers do these days, relations of *better than* and *equal to*. I'm going to use somewhat older ideology. Following @Sen1970sec, I'll write *xRy* for the claim that *x* is at least as good as *y*. More precisely, I'll understand it as the claim that *x* is choiceworthy when it and *y* are the available options.

We can then define relations of strict indifference, *P*, and indifference, *I*, as the asymmetric and symmetric parts of *R*. We could also, if we like, define a relation of equality *E*, where *xEy* means that *x* and *y* stand in the same *R*-relations with respect to some space of options. So defined, *E* is clearly an equivalence relation. But while *I* is by definition symmetric, it isn't obvious it is transitive.^[It also isn't obvious it is reflexive. I'll come back to this presently. Rejecting the transitivity of *I* does not give us a reason to reject the transitivity of *P*, as advocated by, e.g., @Temkin1987.]

The different notations naturally suggest slightly different understandings of what it is for a preference relation to be *complete*. If we start with a strict preference relation ≻, and a relation of equality that's assumed to be a preference relation, it's natural to write a relation of being preferred or equal as ⪰. And then it's natural to understand completeness as what I'll call **E-completeness**.

E-completeness
:    *x* ⪰ *y* ∨ *y* ⪰ *x*

In Nebel's paper he talks about how dropping completeness might be a way out of the problem, and by this he means, as I think most philosophers would these days, E-completeness. If we start with *R* as our basic notion, it's more natural to define completeness as what I'll call **I-completeness**.

I-completeness
:    *xRy* ∨ *yRx*

Both E-completeness and I-completeness can be stated as trichotomy theses.^[The language of trichotomy is taken from @Chang2002.] E-completeness is equivalent to *xPy* ∨ *xEy* ∨ *yPx*, while I-completeness is equivalent to *xPy* ∨ *xIy* ∨ *yPx*.

Assuming *P* is transitive, E-completeness is entailed by I-completeness and the transitivity of *I*. One reason to prefer starting with notions like *R* and *I* is that the last line suggests there are two quite distinct ways for E-completeness to fail. One is that I-completeness fails, and the other is that *I* is intransitive. And it might be useful to readily distinguish these two failure cases.

It is very common to assume *I* is complete, at least as an idealising assumption. There are really two prominent ways for *I* to fail to be complete. One is that the thinker simply has no attitude about (at least one of) *x* and *y*, perhaps because they don't have the capacity to think about them. Think about a subject who has never heard of Porepunkah or Tidbinbilla, and ask what preferences they have over a holiday in one or the other. It's natural to say that any positive claim about what preferences they have is false, so I-completeness fails. I-completeness might also fail if there are prudential dilemmas, where neither choice is acceptable.

The cases where I-completeness fails are very different from the cases where *I* appears to be intransitive. There are two such cases that have some importance in the historical literature.

The older case, first discussed by Wallace @Armstrong1939, starts with the assumption that perceptual discriminability is intransitive. There may be a Sorites series of cups of coffee with sugar where the subject cannot tell any two adjacent cups apart, and so is indifferent between any pair, but the last one is too sweet for the chooser, so they strictly prefer the first cup to the last cup. This looks like a good argument against the transitivity of indifference iff perceptual indiscriminability really is intransitive. If it is transitive, as Delia Graff @Fara2001 argues, then it is less compelling.

The other argument traces back to an example by Gerard @Debreu1960. Let *x* and *y* be very different options that the chooser is indifferent between, in the sense that they could happily choose either. Now let *x*^+^ be something that strictly improves *x*, e.g., it is *x* plus a dollar.^[Debreu describes an example like this but not this argument. I haven't been able to find anything I'd happily say is the first instance of this argument. I don't think the arguments in @Keynes1921 for non-numerical probability are quite of this form, though perhaps that's uncharitable.] Plausibly we have *xIy* and *yIx*^+^, but we definitely do not have *xIx*^+^. This is the kind of example that motivated @Sen1970sec to look for what happens to Arrow's impossibility theorem when we drop the assumption that indifference in the social ordering is transitive. Like Sen, I'll
