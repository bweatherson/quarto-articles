title: "The Impossibility of an Infinite Paretian"
abstract: |
 Jake Nebel has a really nice example that he thinks shows that a kind of impartiality is impossible in infinite cases. I think it shows something else, namely that various Pareto principles are inconsistent in infinite settings.

Jake @Nebel2025 has a nice argument coming out in *Noûs* against the possibility of having agent-neutral values in certain infinite worlds. That's to say, he has a proof that in infinite cases a bunch of plausible principles turn out to be inconsistent, one of them being the possibility of agent-neutral values. He argues that's the one of the inconsistent set we should reject.

I'm going to use his example to argue for a different conclusion. I think what his case shows is that some very plausible looking Pareto principles can't be correct. These infinitary cases should be thought of, like the example @Sen1970 gives of nosy neighbours in a liberal society, as reasons to be sceptical of Pareto optimality.

Here is the main case that Nebel uses.^[His example draws on @Goodsell2021.] We have a world consisting of a countable infinity of people, *a*~1~, *a*~2~, …, *b*~1~, *b*~2~, …. Each of these people has one of two possible welfare states, which we'll denote as 0 and 1. We'll say an outcome is any assignment of a probability distribution of welfare payouts to each individual. (This means that we're not going to consider what happens if the world population changes; that raises a whole host of different concerns.)

One of four lotteries will take place. The lotteries are shown in @tbl-nebel. In each lottery, there are two random devices that contribute to the state. The first is a fair [red]{.text-red} coin which will be flipped once. The second is a fair coin that will be flipped indefinitely until it lands heads. We'll write [H]{.text-red} and [T]{.text-red} for the [red]{.text-red} coin landing heads and tails respectively, and H~*i*~ for the proposition that the other coin will be flipped *i* times. (For completeness, say that H~1~ also includes the possibility that it lands tails every time.) So we have the states shown in the top row of @tbl-nebel, with their probability below them. In each cell, we show the people who get payout 1 in that state from that lottery; everyone else gets payout 0.

: Nebel's example {#tbl-nebel}
:::

Now assume that that for each person *x* we have relations of strict preference ≻~*x*~ and indifference &#126;~*x*~, and from a society wide perspective a social welfare ordering, i.e., a pair of relations of strict preference ≻~∀~ and indifference \~~∀~. We'll also assume that no matter the subscript, that \~ is symmetric and ≻ is asymmetric, and that for any options *A* and *B*, *A* ≻ *B*, *A* \~ *B* and *B* ≻ *A* are exclusive and exhaustive.

We'll also assume that each individual prefers a higher probability of getting 1 to a lower probability, and is indifferent between any two states with the same probability of getting 1.

Nebel then derives a contradiction from the following assumptions.

Transitivity of Social Indifference
:    If *A* &#126;~∀~ *B* and *B* &#126;~∀~ *C* then *A* \~~∀~ *C*.

Pareto Indifference
:    If *A* &#126;~*x*~ *B* for all *x*, then *A* \~~∀~ *B*.

Pareto Strict Preference
:    If *A* ≻~*x*~ *B* for all *x*, then *A* ≻~∀~ *B*.

Pairwise Anonymity
:    For outcome *O* and individual *x*, write *O~x~* for the outcome individual *x* gets in *O*. For any outcomes *A* and *B* if there are two individuals *i* and *j* such that *A~i~* &#126;~*i*~ *B*~j~ and *A~j~* &#126;~*j*~ *B*~i~, and for all other individuals *h*, *A~h~* &#126;~*h*~ *B*~h~, then *A* &#126;~∀~ *B*.

Lottery Indifference
:    For any two lotteries *A* and *B* defined over the same partition of the possibilities in states, if in each state *A* &#126;~∀~ *B*, then prior to the lottery taking place, *A* &#126;~∀~ *B*.

We now reason as follows.

First, to prove *Q*ʹ ≻~∀~ *Q*. Note that each individual has a higher probability of getting 1 in *Q*ʹ than *Q*. So *Q*ʹ ≻~*x*~ *Q* for all *x*, so by Pareto Strict Preference, *Q*ʹ ≻~∀~ *Q*.

Second, to prove *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*. In each result of the lottery, the same number of people get 1. So in each state, a finite number of applications of Pairwise Anonymity plus one use of Pareto Indifference we have *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P* conditional on each state of the lottery. So by Lottery Indifference, *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*.

Third, to prove *P* &#126;~∀~ *P*ʹ. Each individual has the same probability of getting 1 in each lottery, so each individual is indifferent between the lotteries, so by Pareto Indifference, *P* &#126;~∀~ *P*ʹ.

Fourth, to prove *P*ʹ &#126;~∀~ *Q*ʹ. Here it is the same reasoning as in step 2. No matter what lottery outcome we're in, the same number of people get payout 1 in *P*ʹ as *Q*ʹ, so by many (but in each state a finite number of) applications of Pairwise Anonymity plus one use of Pareto Indifference we have *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P* conditional on each state of the lottery. So by Lottery Indifference, *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*.

Fifth, by two applications of Transitivity of Indifference we get from *Q* &#126;~∀~ *P*, *P* &#126;~∀~ *P*ʹ, and *P*ʹ &#126;~∀~ *Q*ʹ to *Q* &#126;~∀~ *Q*ʹ, contradicting *Q*ʹ ≻~∀~ *Q*.

Nebel argues that the culprit here is Pairwise Anonymity. I think that's not right. I'm going to develop a similar puzzle that gets to a contradiction without Pairwise Anonymity. To be sure, I will use other assumptions which one could reasonably argue are to blame for the contradiction we'll get. But I hope this provides independent evidence for 

For what it's worth, in Nebel's example my first reaction is that the culprit is Transitivity of Indifference. We have plenty of examples, going back to @Armstrong1939 and @Debreu1960 of violations of Transitivity of Indifference, and @Sen1970sec argues at length that we should expect it to fail in social settings like this.
