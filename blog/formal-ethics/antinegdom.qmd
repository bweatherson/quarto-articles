title: "The Worlds of Negative Dominance"
abstract: |
 Tarsney, Lederman, and Spears have recently argued against the possibility that lives, and worlds, can have incomparable value. Their argument turns on a principle they call Negative Dominance. In this note I argue that we should reject that principle.

One of the big questions in formal ethics over the last few decades has concerned the structure of value. The simplest formal models of value map values onto numbers. This raises an obvious question, one that can be asked of all models, about which aspects of the model reflect reality, and which are mere artefacts of the model. This note concerns one such feature: the fact that numbers are ordered.

For any two numbers *x* and *y*, either *x* > *y*, or *y* > *x*, or *x* = *y*. Is this also true for value? For any two values, is it always true that one is greater, or they are equal? The terminology around here gets confusing, because the language that some writers use for a negative answer to this question gets used by others for theories that offer a particular theory of how and why this disjunction fails. I'll say that some values are *complete* if for any two of them, one is greater or both are equal, and the claim that they are *incomplete* is the negation of this disjunctive claim.

Incompleteness of value was long discussed, though not under that name, in the economics literature. An important early paper in this tradition is by Amartya @Sen1969, who shows that the famous impossibility results due to @Arrow1951 don't hold if we drop completeness, and works out what conditions on choice functions or on 'weak preference' suffice for completeness.^[I say 'early' because this is early relative to the philosophical discussions, but the citations in Sen's paper are sufficient evidence that this was a thriving literature in the 1960s.] This debate moves into philosophy largely through works by Joseph @Raz1986, Isaac @Levi1986, and, most influentially in recent years, Ruth @Chang2002.

There have been several recent defences of completeness against these views. John @Broome1997 argues against incompleteness using considerations about vagueness. Johan @Gustafsson2022 deploys a moneypump argument against incompleteness. And Cian @DorrEtAl2023 argue against any kind of incompleteness on semantic grounds.

Recently Christian @TarsneyEtAl2026 have presented an aggregation argument against completeness for the value of lives and worlds. They argue that if the values of lives are incomplete, some plausible aggregation principles linking the values of lives to the values of worlds will fail. This is a really fascinating addition to the literature for several reasons.

One notable feature of their argument is that it isn't an argument for completeness in general. Here's one reason for believing that some things have incomplete values. John Maynard @Keynes1921 and James @Joyce2010 have argued that probabilities are imprecise. If they are right, then the class of gambles on propositions with imprecise probabilities should have incomplete values.^[I'm going to use two distinctions here, roughly following Tarsney et al, which I think are helpful. I'll say an *outcome* is a full specification of how things go for an agent or a world, while an *option* is anything that can be chosen. A particular life of an artist is an outcome; going to art school is an option. A *lottery* is a probability distribution over outcomes. A *gamble* is any function from a partition of possibility space to options. So a 50/50 chance of getting this artist's life or that banker's life is a lottery; a ticket that pays $100 if this horse wins the cup is a gamble. All lotteries are gambles, and all outcomes are options, but the converse fails in both cases.] Nothing in Tarsney et al's argument tells against this. They argue for completeness for certain kinds of final value, not for all things that can be chosen. Indeed, they don't even argue for it for all kinds of final value. As they are careful to note, their view is consistent with the view that the values of worlds with different populations are incomplete. This is, to my knowledge, the first argument for this kind of restricted completeness claim in the literature. That makes it interesting, and also more plausible than the unrestricted completeness claims.

The other striking feature of their argument concerns its direction. It's easy to assume, in any area of philosophy really, that epistemology follows metaphysics. That is, if F is grounded in G, it's easy to assume that our knowledge of features of F should be based in knowledge of features of G, and not vice versa. But this isn't how epistemology works; anything can be evidence for anything. This is an important point in broader decision theory. Even if the value of a single choice isn't a function of how it interacts with later choices, sometimes we get evidence for rational constraints on single choices by thinking about rational constraints on dynamic choice. It's a good idea to check whether we can learn about the value of lives by thinking about the value of worlds, even if the value of worlds is ultimately grounded in the value of lives. The easy assumption I mentioned above means that it's easy to miss the possibility of learning this way.

All that said, I don't think their argument ultimately works, and the point of this note is to say why. But I want to stress from the top that if my objections work at all, they at most target the details of their argument. The broader methodology, of looking for whether completeness might hold in some particular domain, and of using aggregation as a means of learning about completeness, seems both correct and valuable.

It's time to move onto details. Assume we have some function *v* that takes as input, individuals, worlds, or lotteries over these things. Even though we won't assume the ra
We won't assume the output of *v* is a number, but we will assume these outputs can be ordered. So if *a* and *b* are individuals, we'll assume that things like *v*(*a*) ⩾ *v*(*b*) make sense. There are two further assumptions we could make, but won't. One is that comparisons of this sort between individuals and worlds are possible. Another, stronger, assumption, is that if *x* and *y* are in the domain of *v*, then exactly one of *v*(*a*) ⩾ *v*(*b*), *v*(*a*) = *v*(*b*), and *v*(*a*) < *v*(*b*) is true. Call this last assumption **completeness**. In general completeness is somewhat implausible because it requires that we can compare lives and worlds. Tarsney et al are interested in a weaker version of completeness, which says that when *x* and *y* are either both lives, or both worlds, one of those three statuses obtain. I'm interested in defending incompleteness about both lives and worlds.

Note that if incompleteness is true, then there is a difference between ¬(*v*(*a*) < *v*(*b*)), and ((*v*(*a*) > *v*(*b*)) ∨ (*v*(*a*) = *v*(*b*))). When I write *v*(*a*) ⩾ *v*(*b*), I'll always mean the disjunction. So if *a* and *b* are incomparable, *v*(*a*) ⩾ *v*(*b*) is false. I'll use *v*(*a*) ~ *v*(*b*) as shorthand for the claim that all of *v*(*a*) > *v*(*b*), *v*(*a*) = *v*(*b*), and *v*(*a*) < *v*(*b*) are false.

For any world *w*, let P(*w*) be the population of *w*. Assume that we have two worlds *w*~1~ and *w*~2~ such that P(*w*~1~) = P(*w*~2~) = C. (Intuitively, C is our community.) Let π be an arbitrary permutation of C. Assume that we have three lives *a*, *b* and *a*^+^ such that *v*(*a*) ~ *v*(*b*), *v*(*a*^+^) ~ *v*(*b*), and *v*(*a*^+^) > *v*(*a*). For now we're just going to be interested in the very simple case where C = {*p*~1~, *p*~2~}. In those cases, write ⟨*x*, *y*⟩ for the world where *p*~1~ has life *x*, and *p*~2~ has life *y*. Now consider the following three somewhat plausible principles.

Anonymity
:    ∀*x*,*y*: *v*(⟨*x*, *y*⟩) = *v*(⟨*y*, *x*⟩)

The more general form of this says that if for any person *x* in C, if the life they have in *w*~1~ is exactly as good as the life that π(*x*) has in *w*~2~, then *v*(*w*~1~) = then *v*(*w*~2~). But we'll just use the binary case for now. Intuitively, permuting who has which life doesn't change the value of the world as a whole.

Negative Pareto
:    ∀*x*~1~,*x*~2~,*y*~1~,*y*~2~: [¬(*v*(*x*~1~) > *v*(*x*~2~)) ∧ ¬(*v*(*y*~1~) > *v*(*y*~2~))] → ¬(*v*(⟨*x*~1~, *y*~1~⟩) > *v*(⟨*x*~2~, *y*~2~⟩))

The more general form of this says that if it's true for all people in C that their life in *w*~1~ is not better than their life in *w*~2~, then *w*~1~ is not better than *w*~2~. Intuitively, you only make worlds better by making someone's life better. As Tarsney et al note, you might worry about this because you care about distributional features of value, or about features of value, like natural beauty, that don't affect welfare. I'm going to set those worries aside, and eventually argue that **Negative Pareto** fails even when we just care about the welfare of individuals.

Positive Pareto
:    ∀*x*,*y*,*z*: (*v*(*x*) > *v*(*z*)) → (*v*(⟨*x*, *y*⟩) > *v*(⟨*z*, *y*⟩))

The more general form of this says that if everyone is at least as well off in *w*~1~ as *w*~2~, and at least one person is better off, then *w*~1~ is better than *w*~2~. Intuitively, you make things better if you make someone better off without harming anyone else.

From these principles and our assumptions about *a*, *b* and *a*^+^ we can quickly derive a contradiction.

1. *v*(⟨*a*^+^, *b*⟩) > *v*(⟨*a*, *b*⟩)  (**Positive Pareto**)
2. *v*(⟨*a*, *b*⟩) = *v*(⟨*b*, *a*⟩)  (**Anonymity**)
3. *v*(⟨*a*^+^, *b*⟩) > *v*(⟨*b*, *a*⟩)  (1, 2)
4. ¬[*v*(⟨*a*^+^, *b*⟩) > *v*(⟨*b*, *a*⟩)]  (**Negative Pareto**)

If *v*(*a*) ~ *v*(*b*), then it is really plausible that some such *a*^+^ exists. For any life, it's easy to imagine a life that is just like it, but things go just a little better. So really what this shows is that the three principles are incompatible with *a* and *b* being incomparable. Since the three principles are very plausible, does that mean that incompleteness is ruled out?

Not so fast! Let's look more closely at the argument for **Negative Pareto**. What it says is that you can only make a world better by making some particular person's life go better. That might seem like it is motivated by welfarism, the view that the only things that matter to the value of a world are the things that matter to the value of individual lives. But actually **Negative Pareto** is a bit stronger than welfarism. It says that something can only make a decisive difference to the comparison between worlds if it makes a decisive difference to at least one person's life. That need not be true, and indeed fails in some simple, welfarist models.

Start with the model in @Ledermannd. When the input to *v* is an individual, the output in a vector. For simplicity, we'll take it to be a vector in 2-space, so ⟨*x*, *y*⟩, where *x* and *y* are numbers. We'll say that these vectors are equal iff they are equal in both dimensions. And we'll say that one is greater than another iff it is greater in one dimension, and at least as great in the other dimension. Now take the simplest possible theory of value for worlds. The value of a world is just the sum of the values of the individual lives. So if the value of *p*~1~'s life is ⟨4, 0⟩, and the value of *p*~2~'s life is ⟨0, 4⟩, then the value of the world is ⟨4, 4⟩. (Don't think too hard about what this means for the completeness of worlds and lives; we'll ignore those comparisons.) Then we compare worlds just the same way we compared lives.

This model looks welfarist; the value of a world is just the sum of the value of the lives in it. But it violates **Negative Pareto**. A simple counterexample is in @tbl-simple-counterexample.

|         |  *w*~1~  |  *w*~2~  |
|--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| *p*~1~  |  ⟨4, 0⟩  |   ⟨1, 4⟩ |
| *p*~2~  |  ⟨0, 4⟩  |   ⟨4, 0⟩ |
| Total   |  ⟨4, 4⟩  |   ⟨5, 4⟩ |

:   A counterexample to **Negative Pareto** {#tbl-simple-counterexample}

Each cell in @tbl-simple-counterexample gives the value of the life that the person on the row has in the world in the column. It's easy enough to see that each person has incomparable lives in *w*~1~ and *w*~2~. But the bottom line shows that *w*~2~ is better than *w*~1~. Note also that **Positive Pareto** and **Anonymity** hold in this model; they really are consequences of a plausible welfarism.

What's crucial is this. The value of a world is solely a function of the values of the lives of the people in it. Or, at least, that's a simplifying assumption that all parties to this debate are making. But that doesn't mean that comparisons between worlds are a function of comparisons of lives in those worlds. Moving from facts about value to facts about comparative goodness involves throwing away information. And that information might be crucial to determining how valuable the world as a whole is.

After all that, it's time to return to Tarsney et al. Their argument doesn't involve these principles. Instead, they are interested in principles about lotteries. The core principle, or at least what I think is the false principle in their argument, is **Negative Dominance**.

Negative Dominance 

:    If none of the possible outcomes of lottery *L*~1~ are better than any of the possible outcomes of lottery *L*~2~, then *L*~1~ is not better than
*L*~2~. [@TarsneyEtAl2026 7]

The 'outcomes' here are possible worlds. Their core example uses more or less the four worlds in @tbl-tarsney. I say 'more or less' because while the numbers I use in the first two rows are just instances of the model they give on page 19, they are definitely not committed to the aggregation function I'm using in the row labeled 'Total'. So really their model is (a more general version of) the first two rows of @tbl-tarsney.

|         |  *w*~3~  |  *w*~4~  |  *w*~5~  |  *w*~6~  |
|--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| *p*~1~  |  ⟨4, 0⟩  |   ⟨0, 4⟩ |   ⟨4, 1⟩ |   ⟨0, 4⟩ |
| *p*~2~  |  ⟨4, 0⟩  |   ⟨0, 4⟩ |   ⟨0, 4⟩ |   ⟨4, 0⟩ |
| Total   |  ⟨8, 0⟩  |   ⟨0, 8⟩ |   ⟨4, 5⟩ |   ⟨4, 4⟩ |

: The worlds in the core example in @TarsneyEtAl2026. {#tbl-tarsney}

Here's the core argument. Let *L*~1~ be a lottery that has a 50/50 chance of getting *w*~5~ or *w*~6~, and *L*~2~ a lottery that has a 50/50 chance of getting *w*~3~ or *w*~4~. All the outcomes of *L*~1~ are incomparable with all the outcomes of *L*~2~. Their argument for this conclusion is more subtle than my crude aggregation model, but since I agree with that conclusion I'll skip over those subtleties. So no outcome of *L*~1~ is better than any outcome of *L*~2~. So, by **Negative Dominance**, *L*~1~ is not better than *L*~2~.

However, there are several good arguments that *L*~1~ is indeed better than *L*~2~. Again, they have a careful argument for this, but since I agree I'll just note a much cruder argument. Take the value of the lotteries to be the weighted average of the vectors. So the value of *L*~1~ will be ⟨4, 4½⟩, while the value of *L*~2~ will be ⟨4, 4⟩. Hence *L*~1~ is more valuable than *L*~2~, contradicting the conclusion of the last paragraph that it is not more valuable.

They conclude that there is something wrong with the model, and while this is not obvious from my simple model, they show that similar problems will arise however one treats incompleteness between lives and/or worlds. I say the problem is not with incompleteness, but with **Negative Dominance**. Why should we take my side of this standoff?

Well, let's look at their argument for **Negative Dominance**, and compare it to the way that in the model I just sketched, *L*~1~ turned out to be more valuable than *L*~2~. They write,

> The central idea of this story is that the evaluative **ranking** of outcomes is more fundamental than, and integral to explaining, the ranking of lotteries. The value of outcomes is *actual* value ... The value of lotteries is something different in kind... [T]he thing that ultimately matters in evaluating lotteries, and grounds any comparisons between them, is their potential for actual value—that is, the values and probabilities of their potential outcomes ... Nonfinal value is derivative of final value . So the comparative nonfinal value of a pair of lotteries must be explicable in terms of the **comparative** final value of their outcomes. In particular, if *L*~1~ is (nonfinally) better than *L*~2~, then the explanation of this fact must involve some possible outcome of *L*~1~ being (finally) better than some possible outcome of *L*~2~. [@TarsneyEtAl2026 8, italics in original, bolding added]

The arguments about final and nonfinal value here don't justify the two words I've bolded in the text. What's true is that the value of lotteries must be grounded in the values of their outcomes. But this doesn't mean that comparisons between lotteries are grounded in comparisons between outcomes. Comparisons between outcomes throw out lots of information that the full story about the values of those outcomes includes, and the information thrown out might be relevant to the comparison between lotteries. 

For comparison, consider the view (defended by @Gallow2015) that even though all the causal facts supervene on microphysical facts, they need not supervene on microphysical *causal* facts. Even if we just care about causation in the macro-world, we might need to look at non-causal facts in the micro-world to determine what those facts are. My claim here is that even if we want to look at comparisons in things made of outcomes, i.e., lotteries, we might need to look at non-comparative facts about those outcomes.

Again, it helps to look at the crude model. My argument that *L*~1~ is more valuable than *L*~2~ just relied on two principles. First, the value of a world is the sum of the values of the lives in that world. Second, the value of a lottery over worlds is the weighted average of the values of those worlds, where the weights are given by the probabilities in the lottery. That's a model the value of worlds is solely dependent on the value of lives, and where the nonfinal value of lotteries is completely dependent on the final values of the outcomes of those lotteries. But it's not a world where **Negative Dominance** holds. That's because **Negative Dominance** requires more than the dependence of nonfinal value on final value. It requires the dependence of *comparative* nonfinal value on *comparative* final value. That's a further assumption, and one that the defender of incomparable value should be happy to reject.
